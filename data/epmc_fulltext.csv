Musculoskeletal First Contact Practitioners (FCPs) are employed in primary care to assess patients and decrease workload for general practitioners. FCP training requirements are outlined in The Roadmap to Practice (RTP), which includes clinical supervision.

In this qualitative study, 12 musculoskeletal FCPs who had completed FCP training at a specific English university participated in semi‐structured interviews that explored their clinical supervision in primary care.

Thematic analysis identified three themes: operational factors, the role of personal and professional identity and the dynamics of learning. Participants reported variation in support and organisation provided in their places of work and the impact on their learning; specific barriers related to employment contracts were highlighted. Participants reflected on personal and professional factors that were inconsistently addressed, including cultural competence and the relevance of neurodiversity for both patients and professionals. Positive elements were raised relating to learning dynamics, including accessing supervision from more than one individual and representatives from more than one profession. The bidirectional learning opportunities offered from clinical supervision were highlighted, including supervisors who are not musculoskeletal specialists accessing musculoskeletal expertise from their mentees and the FCPs benefitting from supervisors who have extensive experience of managing complex consultations in primary care.

Clinical supervision experiences of FCPs in this study were typically positive. High‐quality supervision is dependent on stakeholders fully understanding the role and is optimised by multi‐professional involvement. Future studies could include evaluation of referral patterns and clinical outcomes of FCPs from varying employment frameworks.

Musculoskeletal First Contact Practitioners (FCPs) are ‘physiotherapists who are able to assess, diagnose, treat, and discharge without medical input, and they are competent at managing the full spectrum of musculoskeletal patients’ (Stynes et al.2020, 3). Musculoskeletal conditions constitute up to 30% of primary care consultations in England (NHS England (a),n.d.) where the FCP role supports General Practitioners (GPs) with this caseload, aiming to optimise patient care by ensuring appropriate expertise at the start of patient pathways (HEE/NHSE2021). Studies demonstrate that FCPs provide safe, clinically effective, cost‐beneficial care with high levels of patient satisfaction (Walsh et al.2024; Goodwin et al.2021; Wood et al.2022).

Health Education England (HEE) (known now as NHSEngland [NHSE]) published the Musculoskeletal FCP ‘Roadmap To Practice’ (RTP) (HEE/NHSE2021), that defines the FCP role, entry criteria, education, training processes and required capabilities, building upon the Musculoskeletal Core Capabilities Framework (HEE/NHSE2018). Training was initially evidenced via an independent ‘portfolio route’ or ‘taught higher education’ route; this was amended in 2024 so that higher education institutions now guide and support both routes. A study exploring experiences of FCPs navigating the ‘independent portfolio route’ concluded that the volume of evidence required and limited guidance was overwhelming for many, particularly novice FCPs who expressed preference for a higher education route (Carus et al.2023).

Clinical supervision is detailed as an integral component of the RTP (HEE/NHSE2021); however, challenges to accessing quality supervision have been previously identified in those undertaking the independent ‘portfolio route’ (Millington et al.2024). This study explores the lived experiences of FCPs undergoing clinical supervision as part of the ‘taught route’ for fulfilment of the RTP. This study aims to:

Explore elements associated with FCP clinical supervision, including logistics, clinicians involved, common areas of practice development and the impact of this training requirement.

Investigate the facilitators and barriers to effective supervision.

Support the development of supervision models for FCPs.

A qualitative design was chosen applying an interpretivist approach underpinned by constructivism (Bryman2021). This approach enables inductive analysis of data from a small number of participants with detailed exploration of individuals' experiences. The researcher assumes a central role by intuitively examining emerging meanings whilst looking for deeper interpretation. Researchers achieve this by engaging participants using personal knowledge and experience whilst undertaking personal reflexivity during the research process (Ayton et al.2024; Braun and Clarke2022).

The research team consisted of academics and physiotherapists experienced in FCP education, its governance framework and the clinical role. The interviewer (S.G.) possessed a shared academic and clinical (FCP) role and had previously completed the RTP requirements. A purposive recruitment strategy was followed; participants invited (via email) had all completed the clinical requirements of the RTP via a higher education route at the researchers' workplace. For this particular university module, eligible clinicians are fully qualified physiotherapists employed in the musculoskeletal FCP role and supported by at least 1 ‘clinical mentor’, a suitably qualified physiotherapist and/or General Practitioner (GP). Students may access support from more than one mentor. The term ‘clinical mentor’ is used for this module; other institutions may use the term ‘supervisor’.

Participants represented a breadth of experience and demographics including diverse UK geographical locations (Table1). Twelve participants were interviewed, enabling a thorough exploration of the topic, collection of manageable data quantity and evidence of data saturation. Similar studies within the field had a comparable sample size (Bassett and Jackson2022; Carus et al.2023).

Participant demographics.

NHS Lothian is in Scotland where there is equivalent to an FCP role; however, the musculoskeletal RTP and funding for FCPs under the Additional Roles scheme is only within NHS England (NHSE).

A semi‐structured interview guide to explore FCP's clinical supervision experiences was created by the research team. This design process was informed by key methodological principles including the need to ensure clarity of intent, enable participant honesty and optimise responses directly related to the research aims (Robson and McCartan2016). As the research team included clinicians employed as FCPs, interview piloting within the team enabled question refinement, clarification of prompt usage and development of an interview topic guide (Appendix1). Semi‐structured interviews (lasting 45–60 min) were conducted with consenting participants via the digital platform, ‘Zoom Workplace’ (Version 6.1.6). Interviews were recorded, anonymised for data analysis and reporting and transcribed. The interviewer had no previous relationship with the participants. Transcription, coding, analysis and reporting of findings were undertaken by team members (P.N. and S.I.), who hold academic and clinical roles. Two participants undertook data verification, and one minor amendment was made to maximise anonymity.

Thematic analysis was guided using Braun and Clarke's six phase approach (Braun and Clarke2022) and the NVivo qualitative software programme (Version 14) utilised. Codes were initially generated by one researcher (P.N.) who had undertaken transcription; these were verified by a second researcher (S.I.) and participant (F.B.). Inter‐coder reliability was established, ensuring that groupings of data were consistent, illustrative of the raw data and the trustworthiness of data analysis could be evidenced (Castleberry and Nolen2018). The analysis was inductive without prior identification of concepts or theories to test or explore. Initial coding provided evidence of data saturation as few new codes were required for the final interviews—markers of data saturation were verified by the participant checker. Secondary coding followed and then development of subcategories, categories and final themes.

Ethical approval for this study was granted by the University of Essex, School of Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercises Faculty Ethics Sub‐Committee (Reference: ETH‐2324‐0690).

Participant demographics are detailed in Table1, and all possessed the minimum experience requirements (5 years post‐qualification with 3 years musculoskeletal experience) as set out by NHSE, ranging from 6 to 21 years post‐qualification experience. Participants had been employed as an FCP between 6 months and 3 years. There was an even distribution of role banding between 7 and 8a (Agenda for Change or equivalent), the recommended standard for this role (CSP2018; HEE/NHSE2021). Geographical locations of participants varied throughout England; one participant was based in Scotland where FCP equivalent roles exist; however, the musculoskeletal RTP and funding for FCPs under the Additional Roles Reimbursement Scheme (ARRS) only apply within England. Professional diversity was seen among mentors.

Table2summarises the coding framework. Three themes were identified for review and discussion: operational factors, the role of personal and professional identity, and dynamics of learning. Examples of quotations from participants have been included to support the presentation of themes.

Data analysis: Coding framework.

Participants reported that their clinical supervision was affected by factors related to the supervision environment, most notably the connections between primary and secondary care services. The category, ‘Service Connections’ was formed by contributions from several participants who highlighted the need for knowledge of services beyond primary care. Value was placed on accessibility of contacts and services in secondary care. Participants who were employed in a split role between primary and secondary care and were familiar with the processes, pathways and contacts in each clinical environment emphasised this advantage.

In my trust, our band sevens are normally a blended role; it's good because it means that the system is very joined up. So, when I refer into orthopaedics, I know those people, I can talk to them about what I need to do to refer, or is this appropriate? It's all very joined up, which I think is often not the case when people just work in FCP because they're a bit sort of marooned.

(P8)

Participants who were only employed in primary care explored the complexities of developing these service connections and found that a small number had managed to access time in secondary care as part of their FCP clinical learning experience.

…. the value of observing practitioners in secondary as well as primary care, because I suppose that's half the job; referring on and knowing if you're referring on appropriately, things to look out for, that kind of thing.

(P5)

Resource availability was the second category of this theme; variation was found between participants. Some were provided with accessible clinical supervision in their own place of work, the organisation was supported by service colleagues and time was allocated.

The PCN were aware that we were both doing the Roadmap…so when it became obvious that we'd blocked an afternoon to do it together, there were no questions asked. They were supportive.

(P10)

Others reported challenges in accessing the resources required to complete this compulsory activity. Whilst accepting personal responsibility for scheduling supervision, some had to address contractual considerations. A participant employed by an NHS Trust and then working for part of their role in primary care explored this complexity:

The PCN clinical leads felt that the element of supervision required formally should fall on the time of the hospital Trust; they were employing the Trust to provide a FCP service and felt that it was the time and responsibility of the hospital Trust to provide that supervision and not for them.

(P4)

Another explained that their employer support was restricted and contractual complexities resulted in them completing the clinical supervision in their own time and unpaid.

It wasn't part of my normal working hours, so it was in addition to my normal work. From a financial point of view as well, it was something that I had to do myself; it wasn't paid work.

(P9)

The volume of material related to individual participant's personal characteristics and the relevance of these was noteworthy. Participants reported that, as clinicians, their own cultural background, personal and professional identity influenced their clinical role and patient interactions.

I was based in a very rural, middle to upper class, white, Caucasian area; a small village. Everyone's very well‐to‐do. So I was the only person of colour there… Understanding of different cultures isn’t there yet, which can act as a barrier.

(P2)

A participant who had trained as a physiotherapist outside the UK explained how their lack of familiarity with the UK system presented some specific learning needs.

I sat in with a lot of people because when I started, I was only four months into the FCP role, so I really wanted to understand the system, because again, I'm not from the system. I didn't grow up in the system.

(P3)

Some participants extended the discussion to include how their clinical learning needed to acknowledge and be responsive to patients' individual features, including their cultural backgrounds.

My FCP mentor did point out a couple of bits about ethnic minority patients, which were useful. I think they were in the back of my mind. Indian patients having a higher prevalence for diabetes, for example.

(P1)

Participants raised the significance of neurodiversity both for themselves as students but also the need to identify and acknowledge relevant neurodiversity issues with patients. As a dyslexic, one participant highlighted that the university route to meeting the RTP's requirements provided more guidance and structure to alternative routes.

Being dyslexic and also struggling with …. what I was doing, …. I thought I just need to go down the university route and get guidance on how to do the task.

(P12)

Others commented that in relation to patients' neurodiversity needs, formal training was limited but as clinicians in primary care, they wanted to offer individualised and responsive patient consultations.

In response to neurodiversity; trying to make reasonable adjustments, trying to ensure that contact with that patient is approachable and as beneficial for them as can be.

(P7)

Professional identity was a topic that participants drew on as they explored settling into and developing the FCP role. Participants reported a widespread lack of role understanding, commenting that they were regularly confused for ‘in‐house’ physiotherapists offering treatment and rehabilitation and several highlighted that many patient consultations were not first contact. The opportunities linked to this relatively new role were discussed by some, who were keen to highlight innovation, good practice and the impact of FCPs they respected. Topics explored included the FCP's ‘position in the team’, (P7), the value of professional specialisation in primary care ‘how much I love being a (musculoskeletal) physio and not having the pressure(of other specialisms)’, (P2) and the potential to ‘make your own path as an FCP’, (P8). As participants explored their professional identity, they made references to the scope of practice and associated complexities. Several noted that whilst additional skills could be acquired and brought into the FCP clinic e.g. injection therapy and independent prescribing, navigating skill integration had to be carefully considered.

My GP is really supportive of me increasing scope of practice and being able to do that. There's always that potential fear of ‘treading on toes,’ and not taking away from what the GP's do. There's a lot in the world of social media about the role of physician associates and what their scope of practice is. As a physio, you feel where does that scope of practice start and end? Where does it cross over into GP territory?

(P4)

The nuances of professional identification as a musculoskeletal FCP were noted by all; individual, service wide and national considerations were reported with a consensus that role identity was not interpreted in a standard way. One participant had used the university's coursework to explore this topic in detail:

I did my service evaluation piece (module assessment) on the understanding of our role, our professional identity.

(P11)

Participants all discussed factors relating to the dynamics of learning, theme categories were: impact of directed learning, influence of mentorship relationship, effectiveness of mentorship and bidirectional learning. Participants reflected strong and positive opinions relating to the value of clear direction and guidance provided by the university.

…everything was very clear about what was expected.

(P3)

Two commonly reported findings related to the clinical mentor's role and impact. Participants reflected positively that the clinical mentor did not complete the formal module assessment—this was the university's responsibility. The clinical mentor's role was to facilitate clinical reasoning, reflection and learning in the clinical environment:

It was a positive in the fact that their focus wasn’t on the marking side of things, it was more on giving me that feedback on practice only.

(P7)

I think that my mentor not grading me probably made me more relaxed in terms of being able to have open discussions, and being more of a learning process, rather than an assessment process.

(P5)

The second commonly reported opinion was the value of accessing more than one mentor and the acknowledgement that different individuals will support different practice elements.

I draw on experience of a variety of members of the primary care team and also secondary care as well. So, I had a good, varied experience with different professionals.

(P1)

Accessing professionally diverse team members throughout the learning experience was regarded positively:

I sat in with as many people as I could…… they were really good. The pharmacists and the wellbeing coach and the social prescribers, they were very on board and understanding.

(P11)

So I suppose we've all got different strings to our bow and things that we’re good at. Someone supervised me who was a very good communicator; very empathetic approach, shared decision making. So I learnt a lot from her and then another person is really into green prescribing, I learnt a lot about local resources and projects.

(P5)

Participants reflected on their clinical learning and shared positive experiences that they felt had enhanced their practice.

The GP's were very refined and to the point with their agenda setting and gaining the patients ideas and expectations specifically, so I think that fed in really nicely to my own practice.

(P7)

Reducing and making my history maybe a little bit more concise, making my questioning a bit more concise. Talking less.

(P11)

So, there was a lot of chronic pain. There was a lot of cases of mental health issues and people with financial issues.

(P9)

A small number of negative experiences were shared when participants did not feel a link between their personal development needs and the mentorship.

There were a few times when he did jump in and start talking… and it becomes a dialogue between the patient and the person observing.

(P10)

Several participants explored the impact of the mentorship activity beyond their own learning noting mentors appeared to have benefited from the experience. For some, it had been an opportunity for the development of professional relationships as mentors and mentees had learnt from each other.

He said I was the first person that really challenged him, but that's a good thing.

(P2)

My mentor was incredibly supportive of the FCP role and very much recognised the value of having an expert musculoskeletal opinion within the clinic and wanted to learn from me as well.

(P4)

Participants made links between the lack of formal assessment undertaken by the mentor and patients' perceptions of the process. Reflecting on discussions had with mentors and the fact that bidirectional learning sometimes took place, the patients' reactions were generally positive:

I'd have discussions in front of patients with my mentor, the patients were always happy and consented, and they quite enjoyed being talked about.

(P6)

I never got the impression that people thought that I was being mentored, it was more just a collaborative approach. I introduced it (supervision) as a routine thing, that everyone should be doing as part of normal practice.

(P5)

This study aimed to understand key elements of clinical supervision, explore associated facilitators and barriers and support the development of supervision models for FCP's. These will be discussed alongside the three themes emerging from the data.

This review highlights the challenges of FCPs with navigating referral systems across both primary and secondary care. The role of FCP's as gatekeepers for secondary care referral has been a key aim of FCP provision (Goodwin et al.2021; Greenhalgh et al.2020; CSP,2018). The CSP (2018) has previously documented that FCPs are better integrated across musculoskeletal pathways with dual roles in primary and secondary care than those who are employed by the incumbent musculoskeletal provider. Being able to identify and streamline appropriate patients quickly and efficiently is seen as pivotal for practicing clinicians (NHS England2019). A lack of clear referral pathways has been highlighted previously (Baird et al.2022) and FCP's working within ARRS roles may struggle to navigate the healthcare system if clear referral pathways to secondary or specialised care are not established. This study highlights the requirement for stakeholders in clinical practice to enable and operationalise appropriate protocols and policies. These should enable FCP's to escalate cases or refer patients to specialists when needed.

This review highlighted that whilst supervision is an essential component of the RTP to ensure safe and effective patient care, clinicians faced challenges accessing supervision and aligned with other studies (Baird et al.2022; Nozedar and O’Shea2023; Ingram et al.2023). Barriers including limited supervisors/mentors, time constraints, unclear expectations, workload and resource strain have been identified as previous obstacles (Baird et al.2022). Time constraints and pressures are major factors contributing to supervision difficulties in busy primary care settings (Baird et al.2022; Nozedar and O’Shea2023). Having access to regular, high‐quality supervision maybe challenging for clinicians juggling clinical and administrative responsibilities, but the need for non‐patient contact time has been recommended (Nozedar and O’Shea2023).

The organisation and procurement of supervision is likely to be underpinned by stakeholder relationships, funding arrangements and administrative support. This review highlighted a lack of organisation and contractual impacts as barriers. FCP's and their supervisors are likely to require administrative support to ensure that supervision is properly documented and feedback provided. Without support, the supervision process may become cumbersome or neglected, perpetuating clinical uncertainty, feelings of stress, and clinical burnout (Ingram et al.2023; Danczak and Lea2017). Contractual arrangements without supervisory detail or funding agreements within current ARRs roles have been highlighted by previous reviews (MacConnachie2024; Baird et al.2022; Bramwell et al.2024; Millington et al.2024). Funding to cover time required for supervision sessions, and additional administrative support should be considered by stakeholders in future provision.

Additional implications for clinical practice relate to acknowledging the need for psychological and operational support relating to supervision. Enabling FCP wellbeing by ensuring support is available for these clinicians who may experience elevated levels of stress, burnout or fatigue (Nozedar and O’Shea2023; Thompson et al.2024; Welford2018; Ingram et al.2023; Venturini et al.2024) is a consideration of current and future stakeholders.

The cultural backgrounds of clinicians and patients were identified in this research as impacting learning and practice. Challenges of FCPs working with ethnically diverse populations and the impact of health beliefs have been previously identified by Greenhalgh et al. (2020) leading to recommendations for cultural competence training. Addressing cultural competence more fully within FCP teaching, clinical supervision, and in future iterations of the RTP is recommended and could significantly improve FCP job satisfaction, patient outcomes and experiences (Kumar et al.2019; Oelke et al.2013).

The impact and challenges of neurodiversity were raised both from a student and patient perspective. The challenges and positive aspects of neurodiversity for healthcare clinicians have been well documented (Butler2024; Crouch2019). With the completion of the RTP being essential for an FCP role, this research suggests that neurodiverse students' needs may be best met in a HEI taught route. The collaborative learning environment created by studying with others offers belonging, support, community, diversity of thinking, understanding and emotional support that can assist with confidence for neurodiverse clinicians (Butler2024; Robinson2022). Future modifications to the RTP content and options for completion should consider neurodiversity more fully to improve accessibility.

Whilst challenges of access to healthcare for people with learning disabilities are well recognised (Alborz et al.2005), there is a desire from FCP clinicians to be responsive to the needs of individual patient's neurodiversity needs. The introduction of The Oliver McGowan Mandatory Training on Learning Disability and Autism (NHS England (b),n.d.) may have raised awareness of this topic, but its effectiveness or impact on patient experience has not been measured. Gaps in the current evidence‐base present an opportunity for future high‐quality research related to delivering patient‐centred care for all (HEE/NHSE2017).

Professional identity concerns were highlighted in the early stages of the development of the FCP role (Greenhalgh et al.2020; Morris et al.2021, Wood et al.2022) and have been identified by other professional groups integrating into primary care (Jorgenson et al.2014). Nearly 5 years after the launch of the RTP, professional identity remains a key theme highlighted by recent research (Ingram et al.2023; Lewis and Gill2023; Lamb et al.2024; Thompson et al.2024) and by all participants in this study with a lack of understanding about the FCP role remaining, and many still being confused for ‘in‐house’ physiotherapists. The benefits of the FCP role for patients are clear (Wood et al.2022), but lack of role understanding may affect patient accessibility to this service, prevent effective utilisation of the extended scope skills many of these clinicians offer and potentially impact clinical supervision strategies.

The speedy roll out of the role, constraints to support offered from overseeing organisations and the relatively novel nature of physiotherapists being in Primary Care could all contribute to the lack of understanding of the FCP role, but further research and role promotion support is urgently required to maximise the positive impact of this role.

Findings from this review demonstrate the value of having clear direction and guidance provided by a university course. Having a full understanding of what training and supervision is required in a new role is fundamental to the learning process (NHS England2021). RTP documents aimed to establish the capabilities of Allied Health Professions (AHPs) moving into primary care and identify the supervisory support required via either a portfolio or taught university route. However, these roadmaps have been highlighted as being confusing and unclear (Jones et al.2024) and consequently seen as a barrier to completing the portfolio route. The high level of satisfaction with university support identified in this review aligns with previous research identifying the taught route as being a more attractive option (Carus et al.2023).

Findings from this review revealed universal support for formal assessment to be carried out by the university and not the clinical mentor. One supervision element is the completion of paperwork, which is not only time consuming but can also be difficult due to complex marking criteria (Carus et al.2023). Taking away this responsibility protects the mentors' time whilst valuing their contribution to learning through observation, open discussion, and critical feedback. It also challenges the hierarchical relationship of traditional mentoring and allows a more collaborative approach (Teo et al.2024).

Another aspect of learning emphasised in this study is the benefit of accessing more than one mentor from a range of professions to support different elements of practice. In recent years, it has become increasingly common for supervision to be conducted across disciplines, not just for FCPs but for all medical professionals (Launer2018; NHS England2021; McGuinness and Guerin2024). Some of the benefits include offering different perspectives to practice (Launer2018) and providing a catalyst for new ways of working (Davys et al.2021). This may offer considerable benefits to clinicians such as FCPs, who are moving into new roles and settings (Millington et al.2024). In addition, previous literature has acknowledged ‘supervision fatigue’ with GPs often supervising medical students, foundation doctors, and GP registrars as well as ARRS staff within a practice (NHS East & West Midlands Clinical Senates2025). Therefore, taking a multi‐professional approach to mentoring and supervision is also an effective way of sharing this responsibility.

Clinical mentorship is increasingly recognised as a bidirectional process that benefits both mentors and mentees (Burgess et al.2018). Having FCPs with valuable musculoskeletal expertise has been highlighted as an opportunity for other members of the primary care team to upskill in musculoskeletal care (Moffatt et al.2018), and this review further establishes this beneficial relationship. Given the consistent lack of understanding of the role and scope of FCPs (Goodwin et al.2021; Lamb et al.2023), this bidirectional learning also offers an opportunity for other healthcare professionals to gain greater insight and ensure the full potential of FCPs can be realised.

This study methodology has been optimised through alignment of its key domains: research team and reflexivity, study design, analysis and findings with the COREQ consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (Tong et al.2007). Researchers' reflexivity has been considered; their established understanding of the musculoskeletal FCP role has enabled participant recruitment, high level discussion during interviews, and analysis that was subsequently explored with reference to the contemporary healthcare landscape. Engagement of participants in data checking, analysis and the publication process has further contributed to methodological rigour (Stringer and Aragón2020). Potential bias of the research team must be considered as they were all employed at the university where the participants had completed their FCP training but the strategies outlined above were used to ensure that transparency and credibility have been optimised. Recommendations for future research have been proposed in Table3.

Suggestions for future research.

Clinical supervision is a requirement of FCP role training that presents an opportunity for professional development. Its success and impact are dependent on governance structures that support mentor availability and enable engagement with a range of healthcare professionals. The FCP role is not consistently interpreted, and individual clinicians have acknowledged that their personal and professional identities are evolving; factors such as cultural competence and further training relating to neurodiversity should be considered as part of FCP training. Integration of pedagogical principles relating to optimal learning dynamics should be considered when designing and implementing FCP clinical supervision.

The authors would like to thank the participants in this study who offered their time and expertise.

Welcome to this interview and thank you for agreeing to take part in our research study. Today is[insert the date and time of the interview]. As you are aware, we are exploring FCP experience of supervision. The participant information form has been provided and summarises the topics that will be investigated; we hope to explore these in this interview. Are you happy with the information which you have received about the study and do you understand this fully?

Do you agree to participate in the research project, ‘First Contact Physiotherapists experiences and reflections of the clinical supervision element of part 2 of the “Roadmap to Practice” (Higher Education Route)’ and for me to record this interview?

First of all, thinking back to your stage 2 FCP supervision, can you clarify when this took place?

Are you able to reflect on your supervision, can you summarise the key elements, for instance who was involved, how did you feel it went, any positive or negative experiences?

Clarification of professionals involved (FCP or GP). What proportion involved which professional?

Reflecting on the different clinicians, what was similar and what was different?

What do you think constitutes good practice within supervision? You have already mentioned (e.g. time, approach), can you expand?

Was there anything about how the formalities or structure of the supervision and arrangement affected the power dynamic between you and the supervisor? (for this specific stage 2 part of the ‘roadmap’ the supervisor didn't have to formally assess/judge you, did this have any influence on the supervision dynamic?)

When you reflect back on the supervision period, were there any limitations to your supervision—anything that you feel could have been enhanced?

If multi‐professional supervision: You had supervisors with different professional roles that is, a GP and an FCP, was there anything that you received which was different from the individual supervisors within their different professional roles? How did this impact your professional development?

OR: If single profession supervision: You had supervision from 1 profession, what was the impact of this? Can you consider how things may have differed if you had accessed supervision from more than 1 profession?

What was the effect of the whole supervision process and supervisors' profession(s) on your personal professional identity? (Explore understanding of scope). Did your view of your role as an MSK Physiotherapist change? Did this affect your approach to MSK consultations? Was there anything you changed in clinical practice as a result?

Thinking now of the individuals involved, yourself and patients, how responsive was the process to all individuals' features and needs? Prompts relating to equality, diversity, inclusivity, health literacy, socioeconomic factors, learning needs and neurodiversity.

Was your supervision conducted locally with your own patient population/caseload or elsewhere? What was the impact?

Considering the coursework completed for this part of the FCP Roadmap, what was your view of the assessment methods and your personal circumstances?

Is there anything else you would like to add? Thank you very much for your time.

We will transcribe and analyse the data once all the interviews have been conducted. We are inviting participants to take part in data verification analysis and elements of the publication writing up. Is this something you would want to be contacted about?

Methylene blue (MB), a phenothiazine derivative, is currently under clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (ad) due to its potential to inhibit tau aggregation, a key pathological process inad. In this study, we developed and qualified a rapid and reliable liquid chromatography‐quadrupole time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry (LC‐qTOF‐MS) method for the quantification of MB in mouse plasma and brain samples. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a PolymerX RP‐1 100 Å (50 × 2 mm, 5 μm) column with a mobile phase consisting of water and methanol containing 0.5% difluoroacetic acid, delivered at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. Calibration curves were constructed using quadratic regression (weighted 1/concentration2) over a range of 3.05–2222.22 ng/mL in both matrices. The method was successfully applied to characterize the pharmacokinetics of MB in male ICR mice, revealing a high systemic clearance (65.64 mL/min/kg) and substantial brain penetration, as indicated by a brain‐to‐plasma partition coefficient (Kp,brain) of 23.50 following single intravenous bolus administration. These findings provide critical insights into MB's in vivo behavior and demonstrate the utility of this bioanalytical method for evaluating MB in preclinical studies.

Alzheimer's disease (ad) is the most common type of dementia, accounting for 60%–80% of all dementia cases (Erkkinen et al.2018). As of 2024, an estimated 6.93 million people in the United States are living withad, and this number is projected to rise to 13.85 million by 2060 (Rajan et al.2021).

The etiology ofadis complex and multifactorial. Key pathological features include the accumulation of amyloid‐beta plaques and abnormal tau proteins, along with acetylcholine deficiency, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, metal ion imbalance, glutamate dysregulation, insulin resistance, gut microbiota alterations, disrupted cholesterol homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired autophagy (Zhang et al.2024). Among these, the formation of amyloid‐beta plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) is a defining pathological feature ofad(DeTure and Dickson2019). The accumulation of these pathological lesions disrupts neurotransmitter balance and induces neuronal death, ultimately leads to cognitive impairment (Yiannopoulou and Papageorgiou2013). Consequently, therapeutic strategies focused on restoring neurotransmitter homeostasis and preventing or eliminating abnormal protein aggregates remain central toadtreatment efforts.

FDA‐approved drug therapies foradfall into two categories: (1) symptomatic treatments that address neurotransmitter imbalances, including cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) and the N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor antagonist (memantine); and (2) disease‐modifying therapies targeting the underlying pathology, such as anti‐amyloid‐beta antibody therapies (aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab), which bind to amyloid‐beta and promote plaque clearance by microglia (Cummings et al.2024). While neurotransmitter‐modulating drugs alleviate symptoms without affecting disease progression, anti‐amyloid‐beta therapies are limited by adverse effects and modest clinical efficacy. These limitations highlight the need for alternative therapeutic approaches. To address this, recent research has increasingly focused on novel therapeutic strategies that target not only amyloid‐beta but also tau proteins (Jeremic et al.2023).

Tau protein plays a crucial role in microtubule assembly and stabilization in normal neurons (Iqbal et al.2010). However, inadpatients, tau undergoes various posttranslational modifications, including hyper‐phosphorylation, acetylation, N‐glycosylation, and truncation, leading to structural misfolding and the formation of aggregates such as tau oligomers, granular tau oligomers, and NFTs. The accumulation of these abnormal tau species contributes to neuronal death (Congdon and Sigurdsson2018; Huang, Neurochemistry Laboratory, and Harvard Medical School2020; Soeda and Takashima2020). Studies suggest that tau oligomers, the precursors to tau filaments, may exhibit greater toxicity inadpatients (Akihiko Takashima2020; Niewiadomska et al.2021; Shafiei et al.2017). Consequently, developing drugs that inhibit tau aggregation or promote its clearance has emerged as a key therapeutic strategy. Among the various tau‐targeting treatments under development, MB stands out as a promising tau aggregation inhibitor (Peng et al.2023; Soeda and Takashima2020).

To the best of the authors' knowledge, despite growing interest in MB for its tau‐inhibiting effects, no analytical method has been reported for its quantification in the brain. Most existing bioanalytical methods focus solely on MB quantification in plasma or whole blood, leaving a critical gap in understanding its distribution in the central nervous system (Burhenne et al.2008; Kim et al.2014; Rengelshausen et al.2004; Yang et al.2011). In contrast, this study presents a comprehensive bioanalytical method that enables MB quantification not only in plasma but also in brain homogenate. Given MB's potential as a tau aggregation inhibitor, the ability to accurately measure its concentration in the brain is crucial for advancing research on its therapeutic applications inneurodegenerative diseases such asad.

Furthermore, while previous studies have employed various separation techniques for MB quantification, this study is the first to utilize difluoroacetic acid (DFA) as a mobile phase additive in reversed‐phase liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry (RPLC–MS). DFA has been increasingly recognized for its ability to enhance chromatographic performance in reversed‐phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) while minimizing the loss of mass spectrometry sensitivity (Fu et al.2023; Lardeux et al.2021; Nguyen et al.2019). Its incorporation effectively mitigates peak broadening and long run times, common challenges in previous studies, thereby enabling the development of a high‐throughput bioanalytical method with improved resolution and efficiency.

The optimized method was successfully applied to pharmacokinetic study samples, enabling a comprehensive characterization of MB's pharmacokinetics in ICR mice, including both plasma pharmacokinetics and brain distribution. Moreover, this bioanalytical method is expected to be applicable to MB derivatives and other structurally similar compounds, expanding its potential in bioanalytical research.

MB, verapamil (used as an internal standard, ISTD) and DFA were purchased from Sigma‐Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Liquid chromatography‐grade methanol (MeOH) and distilled water (DW) for sample preparation were obtained from SAMCHUN (Seoul, South Korea), while dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was purchased from DAEJUNG (Siheung, South Korea). Mass spectrometry‐grade formic acid (FA), MeOH, and DW were purchased from Thermo Fisher (Massachusetts, USA).

Pooled male ICR mouse plasma in sodium heparin was obtained from Biomedex (Seoul, South Korea). All other reagents were commercially available for bioanalytical use and were used without further purification.

The analytical system comprised a CTC HTS PAL autosampler (LEAP Technologies, Carrboro, NC, USA), two Shimadzu Prominence LC‐20adpumps, a Shimadzu CBM‐20A HPLC pump controller (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD, USA), and a TripleTOF 5600 quadrupole time‐of‐flight mass spectrometer equipped with a Duospray ion source (Sciex, Foster City, CA, USA).

For LC separation, the PolymerX RP‐1 100 Å (50 × 2 mm, 5 μm) column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) was used for the separation of MB and its ISTD, verapamil. The injection volume was 7 μL, with the column temperature maintained at 55°C. The mobile phase flow rate was 0.5 mL/min. Mobile phase A consisted of 0.5% (v/v) DFA in DW, while mobile phase B contained 0.5% (v/v) DFA in MeOH. The gradient conditions are detailed in Table1.

Mobile phase B (%) in LC gradient elution.

For mass spectrometry, electrospray ionization in positive mode was used for analyte ionization. Ion source gas 1 and 2 were set at 50 psi, and the curtain gas flow rate was 33 L/min. The ion source temperature was maintained at 500°C, and the ion spray voltage was 5500 V. The mass‐to‐charge (m/z) transitions were as follows: m/z 284.1–268.1 for MB and m/z 455.3–165.1 for verapamil. The declustering potential was set at 100 V for MB and 125 V for verapamil, while the collision energy was 30 V for both compounds.

Data acquisition was performed using Analyst TF software (version 1.6), and data processing was conducted with MultiQuant software (version 3.0.3) (Sciex, Foster City, CA, USA).

A 1 mg/mL MB stock solution was prepared in DMSO, along with a 0.1 mg/mL sub‐stock solution, also in DMSO. Both solutions were stored at −20°C until use.

For the preparation of STD and QC samples, the 0.1 mg/mL sub‐stock solution was serially diluted in DMSO to prepare working solutions. Each working solution was then spiked into blank mouse plasma and blank mouse brain homogenate, followed by the addition of MeOH containing 100 ng/mL of ISTD (verapamil) and 0.1% (v/v) DFA. The final concentrations of the STD samples were 3.05, 9.15, 27.44, 82.31, 246.91, 740.74, and 2222.22 ng/mL in both matrices. The final concentrations of QC samples were 15.03, 165.29, and 1818.18 ng/mL in both matrices.

The in‐house acceptance criteria for accuracy (relative error, RE, %) and precision (relative standard deviation, RSD, %) of the STD and QC samples were set within ±25%, except for the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) sample, which was within ±30%. These criteria, commonly applied during the drug discovery stage, were adhered to in all quantification and qualification experiments conducted in this study (Bateman et al.2013; Xu et al.2005).

A 20 μL mouse plasma sample was transferred into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and mixed with 100 μL of MeOH containing 100 ng/mL of ISTD (verapamil) and 0.1% (v/v) DFA. The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged at 15,871 rcf for 5 min at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was diluted 1:1 with DW, and a 7 μL aliquot was injected for analysis.

The mouse brain was weighed, and 1× phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) was added at a volume twice the brain weight, followed by homogenization (resulting in a total threefold dilution). A 30 μL aliquot of the brain homogenate was transferred to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and mixed with 150 μL of MeOH containing 100 ng/mL of ISTD (verapamil) and 0.1% (v/v) DFA. The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged at 15,871 rcf for 5 min at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was diluted 1:1 with DW, and a 7 μL aliquot was injected for analysis.

To evaluate the robustness and reproducibility of the developed bioanalytical method, linearity, intra‐ and inter‐day accuracy and precision, as well as stability tests, were conducted. Qualification parameters were selected based on a fit‐for‐purpose approach.

STD samples at seven different concentrations and QC samples at three different concentrations were prepared and analyzed. Calibration curves were constructed by plotting the STD sample concentration as the independent variable (x) and the peak area ratio of the analyte to the ISTD as the dependent variable (y), using quadratic regression (y = ax2+ bx + c) with a weighting factor of 1/x2. Linearity was assessed based on the coefficient of correlation (r), which should be > 0.99.

Selectivity and sensitivity were evaluated using chromatographic peaks of the LLOQ sample and blank samples with or without ISTD (BI or BB) in mouse plasma and brain homogenate.

To confirm the robustness and reproducibility of the developed bioanalytical method for quantifying MB in mouse plasma and brain homogenate, fresh STD and QC samples were prepared and analyzed over three separate days. The QC concentrations were set at low (15.03 ng/mL), medium (165.29 ng/mL), and high (1818.18 ng/mL).

The stability of MB in mouse blank plasma and mouse brain homogenate was evaluated under the short‐term (bench‐top), long‐term, and freeze–thaw conditions. QC samples at three concentration levels were subjected to the following conditions; Short‐term stability: incubation at room temperature (RT) for 4 h. Long‐term stability: storage at −80°C for 2 weeks. Freeze–thaw stability: three freeze–thaw cycles between −80°C and RT. Following each storage condition, QC samples were quantified alongside freshly prepared STD samples. Stability was confirmed if the accuracy and precision of QC samples remained within ±25% of the acceptance criteria.

Male ICR mice (7‐weeks old, 30–33 g) were purchased from SAMTAKO (Osan, South Korea) and used for plasma and brain pharmacokinetic studies. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the “Guidelines for the Use of Animals” established by the Chungnam National University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were approved under protocol No. 202404A‐CNU‐071.

MB was dissolved in 100% normal saline and administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg via a single intravenous (IV) bolus injection through the tail vein. Blood samples were collected from the retro‐orbital plexus at 2‐, 5‐, 15‐, 30‐, 60‐, 120‐, 240‐, 480‐, and 1440‐min postdose using heparinized capillary tubes. The collected blood was centrifuged at 15,871 rcf for 5 min at 4°C, and the resulting plasma supernatant was transferred to a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Plasma samples were stored at −80°C until analysis.

To assess the extent of MB brain distribution, brain and plasma samples were collected at 15, 30, 60 and 120 min following single IV bolus administration at 2 mg/kg. At each designated time point, mice (n= 3 per time point) were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with 20 mL of 1× PBS via cardiac puncture. Brain and plasma samples were then stored at −80°C until analysis.

TheKp,brainvalue was calculated using the following equation (Gupta et al.2006).

whereAUCbrain,15–120minandAUCplasma,15–120minrepresent the area under the curve of concentration versus time in the brain and plasma, respectively, from 15‐ to 120‐min postdose.

Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using noncompartmental analysis (NCA) in Phoenix WinNonlin software (version 8.1; Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA).

The parent ion of MB was detected atm/z284.1, with the most abundant product ion atm/z268.1. The MS/MS spectrum of parent ion and its fragment ions are shown in Figure1.

When analyzed using a Phenomenex Kinetex XB‐C18 column (50 × 2.1 mm, 2.6 μm) with 0.1% (v/v) FA in DW/MeOH, poor chromatographic retention was observed (Figure2a). Replacing the Kinetex XB‐C18 column with a PolymerX RP‐1 100 Å column (50 × 2 mm, 5 μm) slightly improved peak shape, but chromatographic retention remained inadequate (Figure2b).



Extracted ion chromatograms of MB (m/z 284.1 to 268.1) under various conditions following protein precipitation from mouse plasma spiked with MB (1818.18 ng/mL).

To enhance the interaction between MB and the stationary phase, the mobile phase additive was changed from FA to DFA, leading to a significant improvement in chromatographic performance (Figure2c).

Despite these adjustments, MB peak tailing persisted. To address this issue, the mobile phase flow rate was increased from 0.4 to 0.5 mL/min. Additionally, the DFA concentration was optimized at 0.1%, 0.25%, and 0.5% to refine peak shape. The differences in peak shape at various concentrations of DFA were subtle; 0.5% DFA produced the sharpest and narrowest peaks (Figure3). Consequently, 0.5% DFA was selected for the final experiments. The PolymerX RP‐1 100 Å, capable of withstanding a pH range from 0 to 14, was chosen.

The calibration curve range was 3.05–2222.22 ng/mL in blank plasma and brain homogenate. The representative regression equations were y = −1.59284e − 7x2+ 0.00341x + 0.01104 (weighting factor: 1/x2,r= 0.99532) in blank plasma and y = −6.00019e − 7x2+ 0.00314x + 0.00336 (weighting factor: 1/x2,r= 0.99643) in blank brain homogenate. The LLOQ was 3.05 ng/mL in mouse plasma and mouse brain homogenate. The representative calibration curve is shown in Figure4.

For selectivity and sensitivity evaluation, extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) for MB were analyzed in BI and LLOQ samples (Figure5). Additional data, including EICs of BB, LLOQ, and the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) samples, are provided in (FigureS1). These results confirm the absence of significant matrix effects or ISTD interference and demonstrate sufficient sensitivity for MB quantification.

The intra‐ and inter‐day accuracy (RE, %) of QC samples at three concentration levels ranged from −14.17% to 13.44% in mouse plasma, and from −10.11% to 2.97% in mouse brain homogenate. The corresponding precision (RSD, %) ranged from 1.63% to 15.92% in mouse plasma and from 2.77% to 8.69% in mouse brain homogenate. These values met the in‐house acceptance criteria, confirming that this method is suitable for reproducible quantification in mouse plasma and brain homogenate (Table2).

Low, medium, and high QC samples were stored under various conditions and quantified using a freshly prepared calibration curve. In mouse plasma, the accuracy (RE, %) ranged from −9.55% to 6.32%, and the precision (RSD, %) ranged from 1.26% to 15.01%. In mouse brain homogenate, the accuracy ranged from −22.32% to 2.51%, and the precision ranged from 1.20% to 6.50% (Table3). These values met the in‐house acceptance criteria of ±25%, confirming that MB remains stable for 4 h at RT, 2 weeks at −80°C, and during three repeated freeze–thaw cycles in mouse plasma and brain homogenate.

The developed method was applied to quantify MB plasma concentrations following a single IV bolus injection at 2 mg/kg in mice. Figure6presents the plasma concentration‐time profile of MB in male ICR mice, and the corresponding pharmacokinetic parameters are summarized in Table4.

Note:The time at which the Cmaxis observed (Tmax), observed maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), total drug exposure defined as area under the concentration‐time curve to the last time point (AUClast), total drug exposure defined as area under the concentration‐time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUCinf), systemic clearance (CL), percentage of AUCinfdue to extrapolation from Tlastto infinity (AUCExtrap), and volume of distribution at steady state (Vss).

The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) was 617.25 ng/mL, with total drug exposure, defined as the area under the concentration‐time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUCinf), measured at 33,053.20 min*ng/mL. The systemic clearance (CL) was 65.64 mL/min/kg, and the volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) was 26,846.51 mL/kg.

To characterize MB distribution in brain tissue, time‐concentration profiles in brain and plasma were obtained (Figure7), and theAUCbrain,15–120minandAUCplasma,15–120minwere 106,372.28 and 4,525.58 min*ng/mL, respectively. The resultingKp,brainvalue was 23.50 (Table5), indicating extensive MB distribution in the brain.

In this study, we developed and qualified a rapid and reliable bioanalytical method using RPLC–MS for the quantification of MB in mouse plasma and brain samples. The incorporation of DFA as a mobile phase additive enabled efficient MB separation in both matrices, yielding sharp peak shapes and a short run time, making it well‐suited for pharmacokinetic studies.

Notably, the brain penetration of MB was significantly higher than expected, with aKp,brainvalue of 23.50. Although the mechanism underlying this high brain penetration remains unclear, further studies using transporter assay systems are warranted to elucidate the pathways involved.

In conclusion, the developed method was successfully applied to plasma pharmacokinetic and brain distribution studies in male ICR mice. Beyond MB, this method is expected to be applicable to the analysis of MB analogs and other cationic basic drugs, making it a versatile tool for bioanalytical research.

Approximately 10%–34% of people experience chronic pain after total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. Prehabilitation approaches that address pre‐operative risk factors for chronic post‐surgical pain are a key area for research. To be effective, prehabilitation requires substantial engagement and behaviour change by patients, which can be challenging in the pre‐operative period. Health psychology theory plays a valuable role in understanding how best to support behaviour change to achieve maximum patient benefit. This study provides insights from REST, a pre‐operative sleep intervention for TKR patients.

In‐depth semi‐structured interviews were conducted with eight TKR patients who took part in the REST feasibility trial. An abductive analysis approach was used to identify the applicability of existing health psychology theories, and to explore new insights into the relationships between stages of behaviour change.

Three thematic areas related to intervention engagement and enactment were identified: (i) health beliefs and readiness to change; (ii) from contemplation to enactment: the role of behaviour change techniques; (iii) and behavioural maintenance.

Findings highlighted three key stages of behaviour change that participants need to be supported in to benefit fully from prehabilitation intervention. Complex behaviour change interventions that include aspects of tailoring should consider the boundaries of acceptable adaption while maintaining core causal mechanisms, and include methods to explore real‐world implementation and usability during the development process. These findings are important for surgeons and multidisciplinary teams to consider when developing new prehabilitation care pathways or when implementing evidence‐based prehabilitation practices.

Total knee replacement (TKR) is the second most common elective surgical procedure in the UK with approximately 100,000 performed yearly (Registry2022). Internationally, > 1 million operations are performed annually, with rates increasing by 22% between 2009 and 2019 (OECD2021). For many people, TKR is effective as it provides improvements in knee function and pain. However, approximately 10%–34% experience chronic post‐surgical pain (pain lasting for longer than 3‐months) (Beswick et al.2012), leading to dissatisfaction and disappointment (Howells et al.2016; Kim et al.2009). People living with pain after surgery describe difficulties managing work and social life, negative emotional impact, and anxiety and fear around further treatment (Sellevold et al.2023).

There is a need to develop new approaches to reduce the incidence and severity of chronic pain after TKR. Prehabilitation interventions (pre‐operative rehabilitation) that address pre‐operative risk factors for developing chronic post‐surgical pain are key areas of research need (Almeida et al.2020; Khalid et al.2024; Vervullens et al.2023). The strongest predictor of pain after TKR is pre‐surgical pain (Lewis et al.2015; Sayers et al.2016; Wylde et al.2011): high pre‐operative pain, pain in other bodily locations, and pain catastrophising are all predictive of greater post‐operative pain severity and increased likelihood of developing chronic post‐surgical pain (Sayers et al.2016). Therefore, approaches that target pain before surgery may provide ways to reduce the proportion of people who will experience chronic post‐surgical pain and may reduce the severity for those who do find that they have such pain.

Sleep is a known vital component of pain experience: reduced sleep is associated with increased nociceptive and neuropathic pain responses (Finan et al.2013; Haack et al.2007), and improvements to sleep can reduce both immediate and long‐term pain in osteoarthritis (Vitiello et al.2009). Sleep is a substantial issue for people awaiting TKR with an estimated 70% experiencing sleep problems (Hawker et al.2010; Manning et al.2017; Wilcox et al.2000). People report problems with getting to sleep, staying asleep, and frequently night waking (M. T. Smith et al.2009). People with poorer sleep have high levels of pain catastrophising, anxiety, and depression (Boye Larsen et al.2021), all factors that predict worse post‐surgical outcomes (Jiang et al.2017; Judge et al.2012). Pre‐operative sleep problems impair healing, increase infection risk (Wright et al.2015), and can extend hospital stays by 1–8 days (Ding et al.2022). Patients with pre‐existing sleep problems are five times more likely to develop post‐operative delirium (Fadayomi et al.2018).

Research on sleep and TKR has predominantly focused on pharmacological interventions in the peri‐ and post‐operative period (Gong et al.2015; Kirksey et al.2015; Krenk et al.2014). NICE and EULAR guidance for insomnia and pain management advise against pharmacological therapy for long‐term sleep management, recommending behavioural approaches as first‐line treatment (Geenen et al.2018; NICE2021), which are more sustainable and cost‐effective, with lower risk of side effects (Koffel et al.2019). There is a paucity of research on non‐pharmacological pre‐operative interventions for TKR patients; however, there is a solid evidence base for behavioural sleep interventions for chronic pain patients, which offers promise. Three of the most well‐recognised approaches are cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT‐i), relaxation, and mindfulness. All these studies demonstrate effectiveness in improving sleep for people experiencing chronic pain (Okajima et al.2011; Sun et al.2013; Wang et al.2018; Whale et al.2022). CBT‐i comprises personalised programmes to explore and change beliefs and behaviours that affect the ability to sleep. This includes establishing a bedtime routine, sleep restriction, and limiting time spent in bed awake. CBT‐i can be delivered in person with a therapist or through automated delivery via websites and apps (eCBT‐i) (Zachariae et al.2016). Relaxation and mindfulness are the most common sleep self‐help techniques, including progressive muscle relaxation, breathing exercises, and attention regulation (Amutio et al.2018; McClusky et al.1991; Sun et al.2013). Behavioural sleep interventions are commonly used in conjunction with sleep hygiene education. Sleep hygiene consists of advice and practical information about how to achieve a good sleep environment, for example, removing electronic devices from the bedroom and having a bedtime routine. Sleep hygiene education offers useful tools for making simple changes but has limited effectiveness as a standalone treatment with best practice to combine it with other intervention approaches (Chung et al.2018).

To improve sleep for TKR patients, we developed the REST intervention (Whale and Gooberman‐Hill2022). REST is a pre‐operative sleep intervention for people undergoing TKR that brings together evidence‐based existing sleep interventions to provide tailored sleep plans, underpinned by health psychology theory. We have conducted a two‐centre feasibility randomised controlled trial, already published (Bertram et al.2024), and this article presents the results of the embedded qualitative study that explored intervention engagement and enactment.

Crucially, our study makes use of health psychology theory. Such theories are vital to the design and refinement of interventions that address health behaviours. Inclusion of theory is recommended in the Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance for intervention development (Craig et al.2008; Skivington et al.2021), with evidence that imbedding behaviour change theory increases intervention effectiveness (Webb et al.2010). Understanding intervention engagement is a crucial part of intervention development and testing (Craig et al.2008; Skivington et al.2021). Successful implementation depends on the recipients being ready and willing to make changes (engagement), and being able to maintain these changes over time in order to experience benefit (enactment) (Sekhon et al.2017). Health psychology theory provides important insight on how to support individuals through this process, and where barriers may occur. For example, the transtheoretical model aids understanding of an individual's readiness to act on a new health behaviour, and the process of moving from contemplation to action and maintenance. Theories of motivation, such as Self‐Determination Theory, provide insight into how change can be sustained, showing that interventions that support people's competency and autonomy lead to greater engagement, motivation, and long‐term behaviour change (Deci and Ryan2008; O'Cathain et al.2019; Ryan et al.2008).

This article describes a qualitative research study, focussing on findings relating to engagement and enactment in the REST intervention.

REST is a tailored intervention delivered approximately 3 months pre‐surgery. Patients attend a remote one‐to‐one appointment with a health professional, lasting approximately 1 hour. In the appointment, a sleep assessment identifies individual sleep issues and needs. Based on the assessment, the professional works with the participant to provide sleep hygiene advice and recommends one of three existing sleep interventions (ESIs):

Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is delivered through Sleepstation (an online platform provided by the UK's National Health Service: NHS).

Relaxation, delivered through the Calm app, guided audio and/or workbook.

Mindfulness meditation, delivered through the Headspace app, guided audio and/or workbook.

Participants are provided with a personalised sleep plan including SMART sleep hygiene goals, a detailed overview of their chosen ESI, and any materials. Participants receive a follow‐up call from the health professional 4 weeks after their appointment to review progress and engagement. This includes addressing barriers, reviewing of the sleep goals, and adjusting the sleep plan if needed.

A qualitative interview study with study participants was conducted to assess the acceptability of REST. The secondary aims were to explore levels of engagement and enactment with the sleep plan and identify any areas for refinement. The qualitative study was embedded in a feasibility randomised trial. Feasibility trials are designed to ascertain whether and how a fully powered trial could happen (Eldridge et al.2016). The REST feasibility trial found that it would be feasible to carry out a fully‐powered randomised controlled trial to evaluate the clinical and cost‐effectiveness of REST (Bertram et al.2024). The qualitative study described here provides distinct information that can be used to refine and enhance the intervention itself.

This study received a favourable opinion and approval from the Health Research Authority and Health and Care Research (University of Bristol Research Data Storage Facility).

Participants were eligible if they participated in the feasibility trial and were able to participate in an interview by telephone or videoconference. Trial participants were asked to complete a consent form, including a check box to indicate interest in the qualitative study. All individuals who indicated their interest in taking part were sent an invitation letter and reply slip and were contacted by the researcher. All participants provided written informed consent for the qualitative study.

Maximum variation sampling was used with sampling criteria of gender, age, and trial arm allocation. We aimed to include 20 intervention participants (10 per site) and 5 usual care participants. During the study and to maximise recruitment, qualitative sampling was expanded to include all intervention participants who had agreed to be contacted. This was needed due to the lower than anticipated number of feasibility trial participants due to the COVID‐19 pandemic reducing the overall number of elective surgical procedures. The total sample size was 13 participants, 8 intervention and 5 usual care. The intervention arm sample was smaller than originally planned. However, qualitative research does not always need to meet a pre‐defined or a priori sample size when information power is assessed (Malterud et al.2016). Assessment of information power showed that the data in the sample enabled the study to meet its aims because of the tightly defined aims and rich data collected.

In‐depth semi‐structured interviews were conducted by an experienced qualitative researcher (EJ), informed by a topic guide developed in collaboration with the study's Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE) group and on the basis of previous research in this area. Interviews explored experiences and acceptability of the REST intervention, engaging with the chosen ESI, and the impact of REST on sleep and pain. Interviews also elicited views about trial processes, which are presented in the article that reports trial results (Bertram et al.2024).

Interviews were conducted either using videoconference or telephone, depending on the participants' preference. All interviews were recorded using an encrypted digital recorder.

Data were analysed using an abductive approach (Vila‐Henninger et al.2022). This was conducted separately from the analysis undertaken to address the feasibility research questions, as outlined in the trial paper. Abductive coding is a flexible approach that uses deductive and inductive analysis to support the exploration of existing theories and concepts, whilst still allowing for new insights to be identified from the data. One researcher (KW) read the transcripts and undertook two stages of data coding. Firstly, a deductive analysis identified concepts related to existing health psychology theory. Secondly, an inductive analysis identified additional data‐driven codes that did not align with existing theories or provided new insights into the relationship between stages of behaviour change. Analysis was conducted by one researcher (KW) with a background in health psychology. Codes were discussed with a second researcher (RGH) with a background in health and anthropology.

The study was developed in collaboration with a musculoskeletal PPIE group comprising 5 patients with lived experience of orthopaedic surgery. The group met four times during the research term to co‐design patient‐facing study materials, monitor study progress, and review results and dissemination plans.

In total, 38 patients agreed to be contacted about taking part in an interview and were sent an invitation letter. The study team received reply slips from 16 participants, of whom 13 took part in an interview (N= 8 intervention/5 usual care). Of the remaining 3 after discussing the interview in more detail with the researcher (EJ), one decided that they were no longer interested in taking part and one declined due to a deterioration in health. The researcher was unsuccessful in contacting the third participant after multiple attempts. Interviews were between 24 and 86 min in duration and were conducted over the telephone (N= 5) or using a secure video platform (N= 8).

Intervention engagement was explored with only the eight intervention group participants. Demographics for the intervention group participants are presented in Table1. All names are pseudonyms.

Three thematic areas were identified:Health beliefs and readiness to change; from contemplation to enactment: the role of behaviour change techniques; and Behavioural maintenance. A diagram illustrating the relationship between each stage is presented in Figure1. Illustrative quotations for each theme are presented in Table2.

Illustrative quotes.

“ I mean compared to other people, there's only one person I know who sleeps worse than me and they're very neurotic [laughs] […]”

I: What do you think kind of good sleep is?

“… seven hours I think is fine for someone my age […] if it could be seven hours unbroken that’d be great. It’s very rare, maybe one in a hundred days I would say when I can sleep right through, wake up and it’s like, ‘I didn't wake up in the night.’ It's a very rare thing to do.”

In health psychology, health beliefs refer to a person's attitudes, values, and knowledge about health and health conditions. Readiness to change is whether or not an individual has reached the point that they are motivated and able to take action. Sleep beliefs played a pivotal role in an individual's readiness to change. Generally, participants had engaged with REST as they felt they had sleep issues and wanted to improve this. Participants said their personal motivation and belief that their sleep needed improvement meant they were highly engaged and ready to try out new techniques (quotes 1, 2 and 3).

Conversely, some participants felt they did not have sleep issues or their view of ‘healthy sleep’ differed from the REST guidance. One participant said their motivation for engaging with the study was to help research and others (quote 4). They saw no personal benefit in enacting the recommended behaviour change.

This incongruence caused negative emotions, such as stress and frustration, and disengagement from the recommended sleep plan (quote 5). This was particularly evident in relation to the CBT‐i recommendation to reduce time awake in bed.

These findings align with the health belief model that highlights the role of perceived threat, benefits, and barriers in deciding whether or not change behaviour (Carpenter2010). For participants who felt their sleep could be improved and had negative experiences of disturbed sleep, the threat of continued poor sleep and benefit of sleep improvement led to motivation to engage with REST. For participants who saw neither threat nor benefit, they felt no motivation to change and, in some cases, negative experiences resulted from their beliefs being contradicted.

A person's ability to move from contemplating change to enacting change is a pivotal if behavioural interventions are to succeed. The behaviour change technique (BCT) taxonomy provides a range of techniques that can be applied to support change (Michie et al.2013). REST was designed to include BCTs within appointment delivery and the sleep plan. The main BCTs participants found beneficial were information from a credible source, goal setting and action planning, and restructuring of the physical environment.

Information from a credible source took place during the intervention appointment with Extended Scope Practitioners and Advanced Physiotherapists who had experience of working with musculoskeletal and orthopaedic surgery patients. Participants reported high confidence in the health professional's knowledge and advice, which in turn gave them confidence and motivation to engage with the sleep plan (quote 6). Feeling supported and listened to was important. Several participants highlighted that autonomy and having a role in the decision‐making process was valued (quotes 7 and 8).

Goal setting and action planning BCTs were central to REST. Following the assessment, participants were provided with a personalised sleep plan including SMART sleep hygiene goals. This involved agreeing goals which were specific, measureable, achievable, relevant and time‐bound. This process included BCTs for goal setting (behaviour), problem solving, goal setting (outcome), action planning, and discrepancy between current behaviour and goal.

These approaches proved particularly effective for addressing caffeine intake, which was found to be high in many participants. One participant discussed how the appointment helped them become aware of the amount of coffee they were drinking, and to make an achievable plan to reduce this (quotes 9 and 10). Another participant described how having a clear plan for engaging with their chosen ESI (relaxation) helped it feel manageable and achievable (quote 11).

Sleep hygiene recommendations are often centred around another known BCT: restructuring of the physical environment. This focused on creating a positive sleep environment including a bedroom that was dark, cool, comfortable, and free from digital devices, televisions, and pets. The most common change was the removal of the television (quotes 12 and 13). Other participants had added items to the environment such as blackout curtains or low‐level lighting (quotes 14 and 15).

Behavioural maintenance is the final stage of supporting long‐term change where the participant is able to sustain the new behaviours over time. Theories of behaviour change maintenance focus on the role of motives, self‐regulation, and habit formation (Kwasnicka et al.2016).

Self‐regulation theories suggest that motivation to avoid negative consequences, such as adverse effects of poor sleep, is not enough to maintain behaviours that require active effort. To transition into long‐term change, positive reinforcement is needed, such as enjoyment of the activity or positive health results, as highlighted in temporal self‐regulation theory (Hall and Fong2007) and the model of behaviour maintenance (Rothman2000). Positive reinforcement leads individuals to psychologically evaluate their behaviour changes as constructive and worth continued investment, and are more likely to make positive self‐judgements about their behaviour, also known as intrinsic motivation (Deci and Ryan2008; Ryan and Deci2000).

These theories reflect the experiences of participants who reported improvements in their sleep and were motivated to maintain the change they had made (quotes 16 and 17). One participant talked about making changes to their bedtime routine, which then became habitual and of benefit (quote 18).

Competence and autonomy are core aspects of successful self‐regulation (Ryan and Deci2000; Ryan et al.2008). To foster intrinsic motivation individuals need to feel capable of performing the behaviour and that it is their choice to do so. Within behaviour change interventions, this can be supported through shared decision making and tailoring (personalising intervention approaches to meet individual needs). REST offers tailoring through personalised sleep hygiene advice and choice of one of three ESIs. However, data indicated that participants engaged in further tailoring to make their sleep plans work best for them.

Several participants who engaged with mindfulness and relaxation said the recommended resources did not work for them, but had found alternatives. One participant used an alternative mindfulness app (quote 19). Another discussed challenges of using an app in bed when his wife was present, and instead preferred to listen to relaxing music, such as Classic FM (quotes 20 and 21). In these cases, the adaptations proved to be effective and positive for the participants, meaning they could engage in relaxation in ways that suited their lifestyle and preferences.

Improving sleep for patients undergoing TKR can benefit preparation for surgery and post‐surgical recovery. Improving sleep can reduce post‐surgical pain severity and analgesia consumption, support immune function and improve wound healing (Tamrat et al.2014; Wright et al.2015). Reduction of pre‐operative pain levels through improved sleep can also benefit patients in the longer term by reducing the risk of developing chronic post‐surgical pain (Sayers et al.2016).

Behavioural sleep management approaches are dependent on substantial engagement and enactment from individuals, which can be a barrier to success. Exploring engagement and enactment with the REST sleep intervention through health psychology theory has highlighted important areas of consideration in intervention feasibility and future implementation. Health beliefs played a pivotal role in motivation and readiness to change. This was particularly apparent in relation to beliefs about what constituted ‘healthy sleep’ and ‘healthy sleep behaviours’. This reflects previous studies which have indicated that dysfunctional sleep beliefs are maintaining mechanism of insomnia (Thakral et al.2020). Population level work has found that common dysfunctional beliefs include underestimating the number of hours sleep needed and that it is best to stay in bed if you have trouble sleeping (Pantesco and Kan2022; Robbins et al.2019), both of which were identified in this study.

The finding that some participants did not believe they had any issues with their sleep, despite reporting eligible sleep disturbance screening scores, was unexpected but raises important considerations for future iterations of REST and NHS practice implementation. An assessment of sleep beliefs and readiness to change could be added to triage people who may benefit from education on healthy sleep, and raise awareness of how their current sleep behaviours might be impacting their sleep quality and joint pain.

REST was designed as a tailored intervention to support competence and autonomy. Participants appreciated the shared decision‐making process, and the personalised SMART goals. Data highlighted that participants were making further adaptations to the mindfulness and relaxation delivery mechanism. This benefitted engagement levels and supported sustained change; however, it raises potential challenges around intervention fidelity. This is an important assessment at the feasibility stage of intervention development, and is a common tension in interventions which include aspects of tailoring and adaptation (Toomey et al.2020). Previous explorations of the fidelity/adaptation boundary have suggested that fidelity should be based on causal mechanisms to ensure intervention effectiveness, whilst allowing for a level of adaptation to promote implementation and sustainability (Bopp et al.2013). Viewed through this perspective, the use of alternative apps for relaxation and mindfulness would be wholey acceptable. The evidence base for music improving sleep quality is less established; however, a recent systematic review indicated effectiveness for sedative music for older adults (Chen et al.2021). To ensure that adaptations maintain the core causal mechanisms, REST could benefit from providing participants with a wider range of evidence‐based alternatives to select from and include discussions about this selection during the appointment or at the 4‐week follow‐up.

It is important to acknowledge that all participants in REST were English speakers, were able to read and write in English, and were all identified as white British/English or Welsh. Not including a diverse range of participants in the intervention development and feasibility testing limits the transferability of findings and may exacerbate existing health inequalities and access, as the intervention design will not have taken into consideration the views and needs of different groups. Within orthopaedics there are widespread inequalities in the provision of joint replacement surgery, and in outcomes after joint surgery (Klemt et al.2021; M. C. Smith et al.2017; Zhang et al.2016). To ensure that interventions such as REST can benefit all patients, future work should seek to gain involvement from racially marginalised groups in order to understand differences in engagement and relevance, cultural context, and benefit.

Exploring participants' experiences of engaging in a surgical prehabilitation intervention through the lens of health psychology theory has provided important insights into intervention feasibility, and the stages of behaviour change. This is important for surgeons and multidisciplinary teams to consider when developing new prehabilitation care pathways or when implementing evidence‐based prehabilitation practices. Interview data has highlighted key stages of behaviour change that need to be supported to achieve full benefit from prehabilitation: readiness to change, enactment, and behavioural maintenance. Complex behaviour change interventions which include aspects of tailoring should consider the boundaries of acceptable adaption while maintaining core causal mechanisms, and include methods to explore real‐world implementation and usability during the development process.

Several phytosterols (PSs), well known for their role in plant physiology and their health benefits, represent a subset of the family of 4‐desmethyl‐sterols. They exhibit remarkable structural variability due to differences in the number and position of C=C bonds in their tetracyclic backbone and side chain composition. When analysed using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), PSs often produce complex and potentially informative spectra, as in the case of electron ionization. However, these spectra have been only partially interpreted so far. Here, a systematic interpretation of the fragmentation of PSs, specifically free sterols, was pursued through a synergic use of high‐ and low‐resolution multistage mass spectrometry (MSn,n= 2–4).

The study focused on protonated and dehydrated forms of standard 4‐desmethyl‐sterols ([M + H‐H2O]+), generated via atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) following reversed‐phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). Deuterium‐labelled versions of cholesterol and stigmasterol, appropriately labelled on their side chains, were examined alongside their natural counterparts and other key PS standards, including β‐sitosterol, campesterol, brassicasterol, Δ5‐avenasterol (isofucosterol) and its isomer Δ7‐avenasterol.

The use of isotopically labelled standards allowed the identification of diagnostic, lowm/z, product ions associated with the side chain, demonstrating that the positive charge can localize not only at the C3 position (associated with the hydroxyl group) but also on the side chain itself (C24/C25). Furthermore, all remaining peak signals in the tandem MS spectra of PSs were successfully elucidated with the help of MS3/MS4measurements, unveiling complex fragmentation pathways involving both the steroidal backbone and the side chain and indicating C17 as an additional potential site for positive charge localization.

The findings described in the paper offer a strong basis for identifying critical structural features of PSs, thus opening interesting perspectives for the identification of minor PSs, often isomeric with more common ones, that can be detected in vegetal matrices.

Phytosterols (PSs) are sterols occurring in plant cell membranes, particularly in raft domains [1]. These ordered and nanoscale regions, where PSs exhibit association with sphingolipids and proteins, play a role in key cellular processes such as plant growth and development, signal transduction in response to environmental stresses and cell‐to‐cell communication through plasmodesmata [2,3]. As shown in Figure1, PSs share the tetracyclic structure of cyclopenta[α]phenanthrene, in whichtransjunctures connect the four rings (A, B, C and D). Two methyl groups are located at C18 and C19, and a side chain (SC) is linked to C17, according to the atom numbering recommended by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) [3,4,5]. Among PSs, free sterols (FSs) are characterized by a hydroxyl group at C3 having β stereochemistry [6], which can be either esterified by a free fatty acid, giving a steryl ester, or form a 1‐O‐β‐glycosidic bond with a hexose, generating a steryl glycoside. If an acyl chain is bound to the C6′ of the sugar, acylated steryl glycosides are obtained [7,8]. FSs can be generally subdivided into 4‐desmethyl, 4α‐methyl and 4,4‐dimethyl sterols, depending on the number of substituents at C4 [9], although the latter two species, acting as precursors of 4‐desmethyl sterols, are scarcely present in plant tissues [10]. Among 4‐desmethyl‐sterols, Δ5‐, Δ7‐, Δ5,7‐ and Δ8‐sterols include one or two C=C bonds on the B ring (see Figure1), distinguishing them from stanols, their saturated counterparts [8]. However, most of the over 250 PSs identified in nature so far [11] are Δ5‐4‐desmethyl‐sterols, which differ from each other for their SC, as shown in Figure1for some of the most important FSs.



(Left side) General chemical structure of Δ5‐4‐desmethyl‐sterols. Carbon atoms are numbered according to the rules established by IUPAC in 1989. (Right side) Side chain (SC) structures and common names for sterols considered in the present study. Δ7‐avenasterol shares the side chain with isofucosterol but has the C=C double bond on a different position of Ring B (between C7 and C8). The numbering of all atoms on the side chain is shown in the case of cholesterol. The C24 configuration is highlighted in the case of campesterol, brassicasterol, β‐sitosterol and stigmasterol.

Cholesterol (CHO), the simplest species among Δ5‐sterols, characterized by an unsaturated and unbranched SC and representing the most abundant sterol in animal tissues, is also present, in low amounts, in plant cells [1,12]. As evidenced in Figure1, the presence of a methyl or an ethyl group linked to C24 of CHO leads to the structures of campesterol and β‐sitosterol, which are among the most abundant PSs [11]. The methylation reaction at C24 may generate both α and β epimers, while the introduction of an ethyl substituent preferentially produces α epimers [4]. Other relevant PSs are brassicasterol and stigmasterol, corresponding to the unsaturated analogues of campesterol and β‐sitosterol, respectively, both having a double bond on C22–C23 [5,6] (see Figure1). Modification of C24 may also introduce an ethylidene group, leading to isofucosterol, also known as Δ5‐avenasterol, representing another non‐negligible PS, often accompanied by its positional isomer Δ7‐avenasterol, having a C=C bond between C7 and C8 on Ring B (see Figure1).

The structural variability of PSs poses a challenge for their qualitative/quantitative analysis in plant extracts, aiming at the assessment of their nutraceutical potential, since PSs have been reported to lower CHO levels and exert antiobesity, anti‐inflammatory and anticancer activities [13,14,15].

Gas chromatography coupled with electron ionization mass spectrometry (GC‐EI‐MS) has long been the conventional method for sterol analysis, including PSs. In fact, major sterols can be separated effectively using low‐medium polarity GC columns [11,16,17,18,19,20], provided they are preliminarily derivatized to trimethylsilyl (TMS) ethers or steryl acetates to enhance volatility and ionization efficiency [21,22]. With the advent of soft atmospheric pressure ionization (API) sources, suitable for the coupling between liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, reversed‐phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) based on C8 or C18 stationary phases has emerged as a powerful alternative [1,23]. This approach eliminates the risks of incomplete derivatization and thermal degradation related to GC conditions. Among API processes, electrospray ionization (ESI) is usually performed on sterols after chemical derivatizations, such as the generation of picolinic esters, aimed at boosting the ionization efficiency [24,25,26]. Proton and sodium adducts are usually produced by sterols under positive ESI conditions [27,28]. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) in positive mode has significantly increased sensitivity (up to two orders of magnitude), leading only to the protonation of the sterols OH group, followed by in‐source loss of water (H2O) to form [M + H‐H2O]+ions [9,29,30]. As a result, RPLC‐APCI‐MS has become a popular method for identifying FSs in food products, including plant‐based ones, although their quantification is limited to species for which standards are available [27,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38].

Actually, the occurrence of several FS isomers, some of which do not correspond to available standards, is common in complex matrices like plant extracts. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), successfully adopted so far for the analysis of other lipid compounds, like glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids and sulfolipids [39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47], represents a promising approach to recognize structural features of sterols, even for species not matching available standards. However, to the best of our knowledge, only two studies have delved so far into a detailed characterization of MS/MS spectra obtained for FSs, which can be complex due to the progressive fragmentation of their structures. Jiang et al. [30] used high‐resolution APCI‐MS/MS relying on the so‐called higher collisional energy dissociation (HCD) mode enabled by the Thermo Scientific Q‐Exactive quadrupole‐Orbitrap mass spectrometer (which actually corresponds to a typical collision‐induced dissociation (CID) in terms of the ion energies involved) and APCI‐MSn(withn= 2, 3) based on a quadrupole‐linear ion trap mass spectrometer to reconstruct the fragmentation patterns of stigmasterol, brassicasterol, β‐sitosterol and campesterol. Münger et al. [48] compared CID‐MS/MS spectra obtained for ESI‐generated positive precursor ions of the aglycones of dietary steryl glycosides with those related to protonated and dehydrated FS ions, which are isomeric with the aglycone ions. These studies highlighted product ions providing insights into the number and position of double bonds on the B ring of the sterol structure. Product ions related to neutral losses occurring from the SC structure of sterols were also evidenced [48], suggesting that a careful interpretation of the sterol complex fragmentation patterns might yield valuable structural information.

Starting from this background, a systematic evaluation has been recently undertaken in our laboratory for fragmentation patterns of specific PS standards using APCI‐tandem/sequential mass spectrometry (APCI‐MSn, withn= 2–4). These experiments were performed under different mass resolution conditions. CHO‐d6and stigmasterol‐d5, isotopically labelled on the respective SCs, were also included among the analysed species to clarify some of the fragmentation pathways. A detailed interpretation of the fragmentation patterns observed for FSs will be discussed in the present work, with a focus on the unexpected product ions arising from the sterol SC. The latter suggested different possible locations of the positive charge of [M + H‐H2O]+ions of FSs. The differences observed for major Δ5‐sterols, as well as between them and Δ7‐avenasterol, will also be discussed to provide general guidelines that might assist in identifying structural features of uncommon sterols, particularly when standards are unavailable.

LC grade acetonitrile (ACN), water (H2O) and formic acid (FA), used for RPLC separations, HPLC grade chloroform (CHCl3) and ethanol (EtOH), employed as solvents for stock solutions, were purchased from Merck (Milan, Italy). Standards of CHO‐d6(cholest‐5‐en‐26,26,26,27,27,27‐d6‐3β‐ol), CHO (cholest‐5‐en‐3β‐ol), campesterol (campest‐5‐en‐3β‐ol), brassicasterol (ergosta‐5,22E‐dien‐3β‐ol), β‐sitosterol (stigmast‐5‐en‐3β‐ol), stigmasterol (stigmasta‐5,22E‐dien‐3β‐ol), isofucosterol (24Z‐ethylidene‐cholest‐5‐en‐3β‐ol) and Δ7‐avenasterol (24Z‐ethylidene‐cholest‐7‐en‐3β‐ol) were acquired from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Standard stigmasterol‐d5(stigmasta‐5,22E‐dien‐24′,24′,24″,24″,24″‐d5‐3β‐ol) was purchased from Merck (Milan, Italy). The solutions required for the calibration of mass spectrometers under positive or negative polarity conditions were purchased from Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA).

A stock solution of each standard (1 mg/mL) was prepared in an EtOH:CHCl3mixture (2:1v/v), and a diluted solution (30 μg/mL) was subsequently obtained in 100% ACN. Moreover, through appropriate dilutions from stock solutions, a comprehensive mix of standards (10 μg/mL for each one) was prepared in 100% ACN.

Mixtures of standard sterols were analysed using an Ultimate 3000 HPLC system coupled with a Q‐Exactive high‐resolution quadrupole‐Orbitrap Fourier‐transform mass spectrometer through an APCI interface (Thermo Fisher, West Palm Beach, CA, USA). A C18 Ascentis Express HPLC column (150 × 2.1 mm id, 2.7 μm particle size) (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) and the following multistep binary elution gradient, based on H2O as Phase A and ACN as Phase B, both containing 0.1% (v/v) FA, were adopted for the separation of FSs: 0–40 min, linear increase of B from 90% to 100%; 40–50 min, isocratic at 100% B; 50–52 min, linear decrease of B from 100% to 90%; 52–60 min, reconditioning at 90% B. Flow rate was set at 0.250 mL/min, and column temperature was kept at 30°C; 5 μL sample volumes were injected. The parameters of the APCI interface and of the ion optics of the Q‐Exactive spectrometer were set as follows: sheath gas flow rate, 40 a.u.; auxiliary gas flow rate, 10 a.u.; capillary temperature, 300°C; S‐lens RF level, 55 a.u.; vaporizer temperature, 250°C. Full scan MS acquisitions in positive ion mode were obtained in a 250–500m/zinterval, working with a 140 000 resolving power atm/z200; the automatic gain control (AGC) level was set at 1 × 106, and the maximum injection time was 100 ms. HCD‐FTMS/MS acquisitions were performed at a 35 000 resolving power in a 50–500m/zinterval, selecting a 1.0m/zisolation window for precursor ions and using normalized collisional energy (NCE) at a value of 30 units; the AGC level was set at 2 × 105, and maximum injection time was 100 ms. The spectrometer was calibrated every 2 days by infusing, at a 30 μL/min flow rate, calibration solutions for positive or negative polarity acquisitions provided by the instrument manufacturer, thus obtaining a mass accuracy always better than 5 ppm.

APCI‐direct infusion analyses (APCI‐DIAs) of individual standards solutions (30 μg/mL) were performed using both the Q‐Exactive spectrometer, under the same conditions described before, and a Velos Pro mass spectrometer, equipped with a two‐stage linear ion trap (Thermo Fisher, West Palm Beach, CA). Specifically, APCI‐DIA‐HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra were collected for specific sterols (vide infra) in the former case, whereas APCI‐DIA‐CID‐MSn(n= 2, 4) experiments were performed with the linear ion trap instrument in order to elucidate major fragmentation patterns of all available FSs. The main operating parameters of the Velos Pro APCI interface and ion optics were set as follows: sheath gas flow rate, 40 a.u.; auxiliary gas flow rate, 10 a.u.; capillary temperature, 300°C; S‐lens RF level, 60 a.u.; vaporizer temperature, 250°C. A 1.0m/zisolation window for the precursor ion and a NCE of 40 units for MS/MS and 25 units for MS3/MS4were adopted; the AGC level was set at 2 × 103, and the maximum injection time was 100 ms.

As a first step of the present study, RPLC‐APCI(+)‐FTMS was carried out on a mixture of standard sterols to explore the relationship between structure and retention time. Firstly, an isocratic separation based on 100% ACN containing 0.1% FA was attempted. However, a complete overlap was observed for peaks of positional isomers isofucosterol (Δ5‐avenasterol) and Δ7‐avenasterol, which share the same SC (see Figure1). After several tests based on gradient elution, with H2O added to the mobile phase as the second solvent, suitable chromatographic conditions were identified, as detailed in the experimental section, allowing an effective separation of the two avenasterols. Figure2shows multiple extracted ion current (EIC) chromatograms finally obtained for monoisotopicm/zratios referred to the [M + H‐H2O]+ions generated by APCI for standard sterols, grouped according to the characteristics of their SC: (A) not alkylated on C24, (B) 24‐methyl and (C) 24‐ethylidene and 24‐ethyl.

The effect on the retention of deuteration of the two methyl groups linked to C25 in CHO‐d6and of the ethyl group linked to C24 in stigmasterol‐d5can be easily inferred from Figure2, since a decrease (0.5/0.4 min) in retention time with respect to the corresponding nondeuterated analogues was observed (see Figure2A,C, respectively). On the other hand, Figure2highlights the key role played by the sterol SC in the interaction with the octadecylic stationary phase.

Sterols with the same number and position of double bonds on the B ring but different SCs showed a clear pattern in retention. Based on their C24 substituent, those with a saturated SC were retained in the order: H < methyl < ethyl, corresponding to CHO < campesterol < β‐sitosterol (see Figure2). A similar trend was observed for sterols including a double bond at C22–C23, with brassicasterol (methylated on C24) being less retained than stigmasterol (ethylated on C24). The occurrence of a C=C bond in the SC reduced the retention time compared to species with a saturated SC, as clearly inferred from the comparison between retention times of stigmasterol and β‐sitosterol in Figure2C. This effect, consistent with that observed for fatty acids including one or more C=C bonds, when comparing their retention with the one of saturated fatty acids (see, e.g., Ref. [49]), varied depending on the C=C bond's location, being more relevant when it was closer to the end of the chain. Indeed, Δ7‐avenasterol and isofucosterol, having a C=C bond between C24 and C24′, exhibited a more relevant reduction in retention time (over 10 min) with respect to β‐sitosterol than stigmasterol (4 min), whose C=C bond is located between C22 and C23 (see Figure2). The effect on retention exerted by the location of the C=C bond on Ring B was more subtle. Indeed, Δ7‐avenasterol was less retained than its positional isomer isofucosterol (Δ5‐avenasterol), suggesting that the closer proximity to the SC of the C=C bond between C7 and C8 reduced its interaction with the stationary phase. It is worth noting that an inversion in the respective retention times of the two isomeric avenasterols was observed by Jiang et al. using a C18 column and an isocratic elution based on ACN/methanol 99:1 (v/v), whereas the retention order of campesterol and β‐sitosterol was in accordance with the one observed during the present study [30].

The chromatographic behaviour described so far suggests that relative retention might be one of the tools for the recognition of new isomeric sterols in complex matrices, especially to infer the characteristics of their SC, by comparison with standards of known sterols. As shown in the following section, a careful interpretation of fragmentation pathways obtained by HCD‐FTMS/MS and CID‐MSnfor standard sterols, including those deuterated on appropriate positions of the molecular structure, provided valuable additional information, potentially useful for the identification of new PSs.

To understand the general fragmentation pattern of Δ5‐sterols with a fully saturated SC, a comparison was made between CHO and its analogue deuterated on the two methyl groups linked to C25 (abbreviated as CHO‐d6in the following). The APCI (+)‐HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra acquired for the respective [M + H‐H2O]+ions (having exactm/zvalues: 369.3516 and 375.3892) are shown in Figure3. For the sake of comparison, the APCI (+)‐HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra obtained for all the other sterols considered in the present study, excepting stigmasterol and its penta‐deuterated counterpart (vide infra), are grouped in Figure4. The complex fragmentation pattern typically observed in tandem MS spectra of FSs reported in previous studies [30,48,50,51,52], leading to a characteristic distribution of product ion abundances, can be easily recognized in all spectra included in the two figures. Notably, a similar pattern has been systematically observed over more than four decades in sterol spectra obtained using electron ionization with high electron energy (70 eV) [53]. The comparison between spectra shown in Figures3and4reveals that sterol fragmentation produces apparently similar clusters of peaks, yet subtle variations in their relative abundances can be recognized by a deeper evaluation. To explore the correlation between structural features and specific abundance profiles, a systematic interpretation of those patterns based also on CID‐MSnwas undertaken in this study, including MS3analyses (like in the study by Jiang et al. [30]) and, for the first time, also MS4acquisitions.



APCI(+)‐HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra referred to [M + H‐H2O]+ions of cholesterol (Plot A) and cholesterol completely deuterated on methyl groups linked to C24 (cholesterol‐d6, Plot B), having exactm/z369.3516 and 375.3892, respectively. Ions sharing the same number of C atoms but differing for the number of H and/or D atoms were grouped within a single cluster, indicated by a capital letter. The MS/MS spectrum of cholesterol‐d6m/zvalues related to ions including six D atoms were reported in red. The NL numbers represent normalization levels (measured as counts/s) related to each spectrum. See text for details.



APCI(+)‐HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra acquired for the [M + H‐H2O]+ions of the standard sterols considered during the present study, along with cholesterol and stigmasterol. Peak signals referred to product ions sharing the same number of carbon atoms and differing in the number of H atoms were grouped within a single cluster, identified by a capital letter. The experimentalm/zratio obtained for the most abundant signal in each cluster is reported. The NL numbers represent normalization levels (measured as counts/s) related to each spectrum.

To facilitate the description of spectral features, peak signals related to product ions having the same number of carbon atoms but differing in the number of H or D atoms were grouped within a single cluster, identified by a capital letter. Moreover,m/zvalues referred to ions including D atoms were highlighted in red in Figure3B. Experimentalm/zvalues rounded off to the fourth decimal place, molecular formulas inferred from them considering a maximum accuracy of 5 ppm and relative intensities for peak signals detected in each cluster for CHO and CHO‐d6are reported in TableS1of the Supporting Information. Minor product ions, not labelled in Figure3for the sake of clarity, are also included in the table.

As emphasized by the red labels in Figure3B, a 6‐unit shift in nominalm/zvalues was observed for several product ions when the precursor ion of CHO‐d6was fragmented. This shift, found in Clusters A, B, N, O, P, Q, R, S and T, indicates the presence of the deuterated part of the SC in the corresponding structure. A systematic comparison across clusters provided further insights into this finding. Two extreme cases were identified: peak signals whose nominalm/zvalues were univocally displaced by 6 units (see boldm/zvalues in TableS1) and those which did not change at all theirm/zvalues (apart from fluctuations on the fourth decimal digit, due to instrumental precision, occurring inm/zvalues underlined in TableS1) when CHO‐d6was fragmented. These results indicated which product ions included the SC and which did not. For the remaining product ions, parallel mechanisms had to be considered. In these cases, both them/zvalue already observed for nondeuterated CHO and one or more new ones, suggesting the presence of 5 or 6 D atoms in the ion structure, were recognized in the FTMS/MS spectrum of CHO‐d6. For example, the product ion detected atm/z57.0708 in the MS/MS spectrum of CHO (Cluster A), consistent with a molecular formula C4H9+(exactm/z57.0699), was observed as a very weak signal also in the MS/MS spectrum of CHO‐d6(see TableS1), but it was accompanied by a relatively stronger signal atm/z63.1083, compatible with the formula C4H3D6+(exactm/z63.1075). As shown on the right side of Scheme1, this formula can be related to the structure of a hexa‐deuteratedtert‐butyl carbocation, arising from a dissociation occurring on the SC of CHO‐d6. The corresponding ion for CHO is a conventionaltert‐butyl carbocation, having an exactm/z57.0699, whose structure is also reported in Scheme1.



Fragmentation pathways hypothesized for cholesterol and cholesterol hexa‐deuterated on methyl groups linked to C25 considering their [M + H‐H2O]+ions generated in the APCI source, with positive charge located (left side) on C3 (where the charge is originally located); (right side) on one of the terminal carbon atoms of the side chain. Plain arrows indicate fragmentations observed in MS/MS spectra (under both HCD and CID conditions); dashed arrows indicate fragmentations observed in CID‐MS3/MS4spectra. Boxes include multiple product ions observed in a single MSn(n= 2–4) spectrum. Exactm/zratios (rounded off to the fourth decimal place) are reported for all product ions.

The generation of these product ions provided a very important and, to the best of our knowledge, unprecedented evidence of the presence of multiple possible locations of positive charge on the structure of the [M + H‐H2O]+precursor ions, alternative to C3, which is usually proposed as the unique location of positive charge for those ions (see, e.g., Refs.30,48). As illustrated in Scheme1, the presence of positive charge on C25, leading to a tertiary carbocation, is required to explain the generation of the ion with exactm/z63.1075 when CHO‐d6is fragmented. By analogy, this feature also accounts for the generation of ions with exactm/z71.0855 and 77.1232, when CHO and CHO‐d6are fragmented, respectively. A detailed representation of the processes hypothesized to explain the generation of these ions and of all the other major product ions withm/zlower than 100 detected upon fragmentation of CHO and CHO‐d6is provided in FigureS1of the Supporting Information. In this case, as in most fragmentation process hypothesized to explain the generation of sterol product ions (vide infra), the proposed mechanism was a 1,3‐H migration between two carbon atoms, with a bond breakage occurring between the second and the third atom involved in the migration and the generation of a C=C bond between the first and the second atom, in accordance with a mechanism proposed in the literature for the charge remote fragmentation of long‐chain functionalized alkanes and alkenes [54].

Interestingly, as indicated in the upper‐left part of Scheme1, a product ion with exactm/z57.0699 might be generated also by CHO‐d6if the positive charge was located on the typical C3 position, since it would result from the fragmentation of Ring A. However, as shown in the fragmentation reaction reported at the top of FigureS1, this process would likely imply the release of a very strained neutral fragment. This might explain the appearance of a very weak peak signal at am/zratio of 57.0708, consistent with the exact value of 57.0699, in the MS/MS spectrum of CHO‐d6(see TableS1).

Notably, other product ions detected in Clusters A and B for CHO and CHO‐d6could only be explained by considering additional possible locations of the positive charge near the end of the CHO SC, specifically at C24 and C26 atoms (see the right side of Scheme1and FigureS1), in addition to C25. The most plausible, though somewhat unusual, process leading to the displacement of the positive charge on positions like C24, C25 and C26 is a hydride transfer occurring from the carbon atom representing the new location of the positive charge to C3, where the charge was initially located after the in‐source loss of H2O from the protonated form of CHO. Notably, Bao et al. [55] previously proposed an intramolecular hydride transfer occurring upon CID in the case of cyclopentenone oxylipins. On the other hand, hydride abstraction was reported to occur from hydrocarbon chains during positive ion APCI, leading to carbocations [56]. If occurring on sterols, this process would lead to [M‐H]+ions or, in the case of subsequent in‐source H2O loss, to [M‐H‐H2O]+ions, yet none of them showed a significant intensity in APCI(+)‐FTMS spectra of sterols in the present case, thus strengthening the hypothesis that the protonation of the OH group, followed by H2O loss and generation of a carbocation on C3, was the prevailing ionization process occurring in the APCI(+) source.

A systematic interpretation of the spectral profiles displayed in Figure3reveals that at least one other possible location of positive charge on the structure of CHO and CHO‐d6[M + H‐H2O]+ions needs to be hypothesized to explain major product ions detected in MS/MS spectra. A key approach during this step of the investigation, expanding the use of MS3already reported for some sterols by Jiang et al. [30], involved the acquisition of the MS3spectrum for each major product ion detected in HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra shown in Figure3and of MS4spectra for selected product ions detected in MS3spectra. These MS3and MS4spectra were obtained under low energy CID conditions using a linear ion trap mass spectrometer, after verifying that each product ion detected in HCD‐MS/MS spectra was also present in low energy CID‐MS/MS ones. A set of genealogical trees, describing schematically the information inferred from MS3and MS4acquisitions performed during the present study on sterols, is included in FigureS2of the Supporting Information.

As a result, solid arrows in Scheme1indicate transitions directly observed at the MS/MS stage, while dashed ones represent selected transitions observed at either the MS3or the MS4stage that led to product ions detected also in MS/MS spectra (the complete representation of all transitions experimentally observed is available in FigureS2). Additionally, boxes reported in the schemes include all major product ions detected directly in an MS/MS (if preceded by a solid arrow) or MS3(if preceded by a dashed arrow) spectrum, with the precursor being the ion preceding a specific box. For example, the product ions with exactm/zvalues of 229.1951 and 215.1794 (belonging to Clusters N and M, respectively) shown in a box on the left side of Scheme1were detected in the 375 > 257 > MS3spectrum of CHO‐d6and also in the 369 > 257 > MS3spectrum of CHO (see also the respective genealogical trees in FigureS2). In this case, the 375 > 313 > 243 > MS4spectrum clarified that them/z215.1794 ion could be generated from the 243 one (as indicated by the curved dashed arrow connecting the two ions in Scheme1), whereas them/z229.1951 ion was directly generated from the precursor ion with exactm/z257.2264 (see the genealogical trees for CHO‐d6in FigureS2). The remarkable amount of spectral information obtained through the adopted multistage MS approach required a complex and careful interpretation, yet it provided an unprecedented level of detail for CHO fragmentation, representing a crucial foundation for explaining the spectral differences observed for other sterols under study, considering their structural differences.

As shown on the left side of Scheme1, the typical location hypothesized for the positive charge in the CHO [M + H‐H2O]+ion, that is, C3 (where the original OH group is linked), was considered a starting point for the interpretation of fragmentation pathways. This approach successfully explained the formation of major product ions in Clusters T (exactm/z313.2890) and S (exactm/z299.2739) and a minor ion in Cluster P (exactm/z257.2264) through dissociations involving the CHO SC, with the complete detachment of the deuterated portion, if present. A description of the specific processes hypothesized to explain the generation of those ions is provided in FigureS3of the Supporting Information. However, these mechanisms could not account for the generation of product ions withm/zvalues systematically shifted by 6 units in the case of CHO‐d6(see Figure3B), thus suggesting that further pathways had to be considered (vide infra). Notably, Scheme1reports plausible product ions originating from product ions T, S and P, all with the positive charge located on C3 and detected in MS3/MS4spectra. The corresponding fragmentation processes, described in detail in FigureS3, involve the sequential opening and fragmentation of Rings D, C and B of CHO, without the displacement of the original C5–C6 double bond. As emphasized in FigureS3, the proposed processes often involve the already mentioned 1,3‐H migration with a C‐C bond breakage and a C=C bond formation. Moreover, the subsequent generation of different structures of the same ion has often to be invoked to finally account for the formation of a specific product ion. Notably, the structure proposed for the product ion consistent with an exactm/z147.1168 (Cluster H), which is the base peak in the HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra of CHO (see Figure3), matches exactly with the ones proposed by Jiang et al. in the fragmentation scheme for stigmasterol [30] and by Münger et al. [48], who identified that ion as a general diagnostic product ion for Δ5sterols. The structure shown for that ion in Scheme1and FigureS3is also consistent with the detection of the most abundant product ion at nominalm/z149 reported by Igarashi et al. [52] when fragmenting CHO including two carbon‐13 (13C) atoms at C3 and C4. An excellent agreement was also found with the results reported by Trösken et al. [50] and Mo et al. [57] for the structure proposed in Scheme1and FigureS3for another relevant product ion, the I one corresponding to an exactm/z161.1325. Indeed, this structure corresponds to that of the product ion detected at nominalm/z167 by those authors when fragmenting CHO deuterated twice on C2 and C4 and once on C3 and C6 [50,57]. Notably, Tröskenet al. detected further relevant product ions at nominalm/z81 and 95 for CHO deuterated on those carbon atoms [50]. However, no plausible mechanism could be found to produce ions with thosem/zratios assuming that the positive charge was on C3. This failure, along with the total lack of explanation for hexa‐deuterated forms of ions T and S, and for major deuterated and nondeuterated ions belonging to Clusters O, P, Q and R observed in the present study, strongly suggested that additional mechanisms, likely implying different charge locations with respect to those reported in Scheme1, had to be hypothesized.

The key for the individuation of a new charge location was provided by the ion detected atm/z81.0705 for both CHO and CHO‐d6(see Figure3), thus certainly not including the terminal part of the SC. A plausible mechanism leading to a product ion with an exactm/zratio (81.0699) consistent with that value (within a 5 ppm accuracy) involves the generation of an allylic carbocation with the pentacyclic structure shown at the top and the bottom of Scheme2. This process might involve a retrocycloaddition occurring at Ring C, previously proposed in the literature [51], followed by the complete elimination of the SC mediated by a 1,3‐H transfer from C22 to C17 (see FigureS4). The mechanism suggests the location of positive charge on C17, a favourable position, since it corresponds to a tertiary carbocation, likely originated (like carbocations on the SC commented before) through an intramolecular hydride transfer, in this case occurring from C17 to the original location of positive charge, C3. As depicted in Scheme2, the positive charge on C17 enables a complete interpretation of the CHO and CHO‐d6fragmentation patterns, explaining the entire set of product ions labelled in the HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra reported in Figure3. A detailed representation of fragmentation steps leading to product ions reported in Scheme2is provided in FiguresS5,S6andS7of the Supporting Information.



Fragmentation pathways hypothesized for cholesterol and cholesterol hexa‐deuterated on methyl groups linked to C25 considering their [M + H‐H2O]+ions generated in the APCI source, with positive charge located on C17. Plain arrows indicate fragmentations observed in MS/MS spectra (under both HCD and CID conditions); dashed arrows indicate fragmentations observed in CID‐MS3/MS4spectra. Boxes include multiple product ions observed in a single MSn(n= 3, 4) spectrum. Exactm/zratios (rounded off to the fourth decimal place) are reported for all product ions.

Structures for Ions T, S, R, Q, P and O, compatible with the 6 units shift in nominalm/zratio observed for them when CHO‐d6was fragmented, could be found by considering the progressive fragmentation of Rings A and B. As emphasized by one of the dashed arrows in Scheme2and in FigureS2, them/z265.2797 ion, belonging to Cluster P of deuterated CHO, was detected in the MS3spectrum of them/z293.3110 ion of Cluster R, thus facilitating its structural interpretation. Similarly, a complete set of product ions, enclosed in rectangular boxes in Scheme2, was observed in the respective MS3spectra of Ions T, S, R and Q reported in the scheme. The MS4spectra further highlighted the complex relationships existing between couples of product ions detected in those MS3spectra. For the sake of clarity, dashed arrows were not included inside those boxes in the case of Scheme2, but the respective transitions were carefully analysed to validate each structure shown in the scheme and are evidenced in the genealogical trees in FigureS2. Notably, a 28 Da neutral loss corresponding to the detachment of an ethylene molecule was very common, whereas a 14 Da neutral loss, putatively corresponding to a methylene loss, was rarely observed, although appearing consistent with the frequent detection of 14m/zunits‐spaced ions in MS3spectra (see FigureS2). For instance, them/z215.1794 ion (Cluster M) was never found in the fragmentation spectrum of them/z229.1951 one (Cluster N) but exhibited a relevant signal in the spectrum of the precursor atm/z243.2107 (Cluster O). On the other hand, methylene losses were inevitably hypothesized to occur from ions with exactm/z161.1325 and 135.1168 since they were inferred from the corresponding MS3spectra (see the second genealogical tree for the CHO‐d6precursor ion in FigureS2and the fragmentation shown at the top‐right side of FigureS6). The relationships found both upwards and downwards in the fragmentation cascades depicted in Schemes1and2and in FigureS2were very useful to formulate consistent structural hypotheses for each product ion, usually considering ring openings and H intramolecular transfers as the possible mechanisms.

As shown in Scheme2, the progressive fragmentation of the SC of Ions T, S, R and Q, with the immediate loss of the deuterated portion in the case of CHO‐d6, was critical to explain the 6‐unit shift inm/zratios observed only for ions of Clusters T to P in the MS/MS spectra reported in Figure3. Notably, among product ions generated in the case of CHO‐d6, those with exactm/z239.2640 and 253.2797, belonging to Clusters N and O, respectively, were not detected in any of the MS3or MS4spectra discussed so far (see the genealogical trees for CHO‐d6in FigureS2). This absence suggested that they were generated directly from the [M + H‐H2O]+precursor ion of CHO‐d6and still included the six D atoms. Consequently, their formation likely implied the fragmentation or the complete loss of Rings A and B, and possibly part of Ring C, but did not involve the SC, as depicted in the upper part of Scheme2and in the respective fragmentation processes in FigureS5. The corresponding nondeuterated ions, having exactm/zvalues of 233.2269 and 247.2426, respectively, were formed and detected in the HCD‐FTMS/MS spectrum when the [M + H‐H2O]+ion of CHO was fragmented. As highlighted in Scheme2, all peak signals in the other clusters displayed identicalm/zratios for CHO and CHO‐d6, excepting those in Clusters A and B, for the reasons previously explained (see Scheme1).

The location of the positive charge on C17 was also important to explain the generation of product ions with a relatively lowm/z(< 150) among them. Indeed, the ion with exactm/z123.1174 (corresponding to the major peak signal of Cluster F, see Figure3) was absent in all CHO‐related MS3spectra concerning Ions T, S, R and Q, but it was detected in the MS3spectrum of them/z257.2264 ion (a minor ion of Cluster P, not labelled in Figure3). Therefore, it was assumed to be formed from the latter, as described in the top‐right side of FigureS5. As shown in Scheme2and in FigureS5, the corresponding structure was compatible with the retainment of Ring D and part of Ring C, and the positive charge on C17 was a determining feature for its generation. This was also the case for the structure shown in the upper part of Scheme2for them/z109.1012 ion (Cluster E), that can be considered complementary to the one proposed in Scheme1. The positive charge on C17 was also important to provide an interpretation for product ions withm/z121.1012 and 81.0699, detected in Clusters F and C, respectively. As shown in Scheme2and FigureS2, these ions were detected both in 375 > 203 > and in 375 > 147 > MS3spectra and in 375 > 293 > 203 > and 375 > 293 > 147 > MS4spectra; thus, their direct precursors were ions withm/zratios of 203.1794 (Cluster L) and 147.1168 (Cluster H), and possible mechanisms for the respective generation from those precursors are reported in FiguresS6andS7. This finding supported the hypothesized chemical structures for the two ions and confirmed the structure previously hypothesized for them/z81.0699 ion. It is worth noting that the mechanism previously hypothesized for them/z81.0699 ion, reported in FigureS4, remains plausible, as the intermediate product ion of the process, that would have am/z199.2327 for CHO‐d6and 193.1956 for CHO (see FigureS1), was detected in the respective HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra, although with very low intensity (they were not labelled withm/zratios in Figure3). This consideration can be extended to other product ions as well. As exemplified in FigureS8, them/z215.1794 ion of Cluster M might be explained also with a cycloelimination on Ring D occurring directly on the [M + H‐H2O]+ions of both CHO and CHO‐d6, assuming the typical positive charge location on C3. Although the final structure would be the same reported in Scheme1, this pathway would not explain the relationship with them/z243.2107 ion, inferred from MS3and MS4spectra (see FigureS2). The potential occurrence of multiple pathways leading to certain product ions can be thus considered a typical feature of the complex fragmentation processes involving CHO and other sterols.

As discussed in detail in the following sections, the careful interpretation of these complex fragmentation pathways allowed for the explanation of subtle differences in the fragmentation profiles observed for typical plant sterols with slightly different structures, paving the way for identifying general structure–fragmentation relationships.

As evidenced in Figure1, campesterol and β‐sitosterol, two of the most significant PSs, are closely related to CHO in terms of molecular structure, since they include the same steroidal backbone (with a C=C bond between C5 and C6) and a completely saturated SC. The only structural difference lies in the presence of a methyl or ethyl group attached to C24, respectively. Therefore, the general similarity observed for APCI(+)‐HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra of CHO, campesterol and β‐sitosterol (see Figures3and4) is not surprising. Specifically, the profiles of Ion Clusters D through M were nearly identical for the three sterols, with them/z147.1166 ion (Cluster H, exactm/z147.1168) consistently appearing as the base peak in the MS/MS spectrum. This similarity is reasonable only if all product ions related to those clusters do not include the SC, as proposed in Schemes1and2.

However, subtle but significant differences were recognized in other clusters. For instance, an increase was observed for the ion of Cluster C with nominalm/z85 in the case of β‐sitosterol (it was not labelled in Figure4for clarity). As depicted in Scheme3and in FigureS9, this finding aligns with the generation of a tertiary carbocation, similar to the one atm/z57.0699 depicted on the right side of Scheme1but modified by the presence of the ethyl moiety linked to C24 (exactm/z85.1012).



Structures hypothesized for product ions detected in the HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra of the [M + H‐H2O]+ions of β‐sitosterol, campesterol, isofucosterol (Δ5‐avenasterol) and Δ7‐avenasterol and recognized as relevant in the assessment of specific structural features of the four phytosterols. The location of the positive charge required to explain the final structures is indicated for each (group of) product ion(s). See text for details.

Scheme3further illustrates that when a methyl or ethyl group is attached to C24, the latter becomes another stable location for the positive charge on the SC, like C25, as it corresponds to a tertiary carbocation. Accordingly, pathways leading to product ions with exactm/z57.0699, 71.0855 and 85.1012 can be easily hypothesized both for campesterol and β‐sitosterol by placing the positive charge on C24 or C25 (see FigureS9). As for product ions with a highm/zratio, a significant difference in relative abundance was found for the ion of cluster N detected atm/z233.2258 for CHO (see Figure3), which was nearly undetectable for campesterol and β‐sitosterol (see Figure4). This finding further supports the structure hypothesized for that ion in Scheme2. Indeed, the methylation/ethylation of C24 would lead to a 14/28‐unit shift in the nominalm/zratio of this product ion in the case of campesterol and β‐sitosterol, explaining why signals at nominalm/z247 (O) and 261 (P) were observed in the corresponding MS/MS spectra (see Figure4A,B). To maintain clarity, these two signals were not labelled with theirm/zratios in the figure. A similar reasoning applies to them/z247 ion (O) of CHO, which also includes the SC (see Scheme2) and was thus shifted to nominalm/zvalues of 261 for campesterol (Cluster P, not labelled in Figure4A) and 275 in the case of β‐sitosterol (Cluster Q, see Figure4B). Despite exhibiting a low intensity, the latter signal can be considered a diagnostic product ion of β‐sitosterol among Δ5‐sterols with a saturated SC.

Another remarkable difference between the two sterols and CHO was found in Cluster P, where them/z257 ion prevailed over them/z259 one, thus reversing the abundance ratio observed for CHO (see Figures3and4A,B). As described in Scheme1and FigureS3, them/z257 ion (exact value 257.2264) might result from the complete elimination of the SC from the CHO precursor ion having its charge on C3 through a 1,3 H migration already proposed by Müngeret al. [48]. An alternative mechanism, illustrated in FigureS10, might explain why the resulting product ion was more abundant in the case of campesterol and β‐sitosterol. Specifically, a concerted process [51], involving a six‐membered transition state with a 1,5‐H transfer from C24 to C17 could be hypothesized. As shown in FigureS10, this process would lead to the detachment of a propene molecule and of an alkene with double substitution (by an isopropyl group and by a methyl or ethyl group) on one of the carbon atoms involved in the C=C bond (C24) rather than the single substitution observed on that atom in the case of CHO.

As for other differences observed between CHO and campesterol/β‐sitosterol, the counterparts of CHO product ions belonging to Clusters P, Q, R, S and T shown in Scheme2were detected in Clusters Q/R, R/S, S/T, T/U and U/V, respectively, for campesterol/β‐sitosterol (see Figure4A,B), in accordance with the 14/28 Da shift occurring on the SC of these sterols. Notably, as shown by the genealogical trees reported for CHO, campesterol and β‐sitosterol in FigureS2, the MS3spectra obtained for the corresponding ions detected in the respective MS/MS spectra displayed the same set of product ions, thus emphasizing the similarity between them, apart from the SC. These findings indirectly supported the structural hypotheses made in Scheme2for CHO Product Ions P, Q, R, S and T, which, as discussed before, are also consistent with the results obtained for CHO‐d6.

The comparison between MS/MS spectra of CHO, campesterol and β‐sitosterol highlights the critical role played by the positive charge location on C17 in the fragmentation pathways of the respective [M + H‐H2O]+ions. It suggests that product ions including the entire SC, havingm/zratio values close to that of the precursor ion, may enable the distinction between the three sterols. Additionally, an increase in product ions detected at nominalm/z85 (Cluster C) and 275 (Cluster Q) was observed for β‐sitosterol.

Both stigmasterol and brassicasterol, which are two further significant plant sterols, possess a C=C bond between C22 and C23 along their SC (see Figure1). This feature is expected to influence their fragmentation patterns, thus potentially leading to differences with respect to sterols discussed so far in this study. By analogy with CHO, isotopically labelled stigmasterol including five D atoms on the ethyl group linked to C24 was analysed during this study to recognize product ions including the terminal part of the SC. The APCI(+)‐FTMS/MS spectra of [M + H‐H2O]+ions for stigmasterol and stigmasterol‐d5(having exactm/zvalues 395.3672 and 400.3986) are compared in Figure5. Product ion clusters are labelled as in previous spectra, withm/zratios referred to deuterated product ions reported in red. A detailed list of experimentalm/zvalues, molecular formulas inferred from them and relative abundances for all product ions detected in the two spectra is provided in TableS2of the Supporting Information using the same code adopted in the case of TableS1to markm/zratios.



APCI(+)‐HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra referred to [M + H‐H2O]+ions of stigmasterol (Plot A) and stigmasterol completely deuterated on the ethyl group linked to C24 (stigmasterol‐d5, Plot B), having exactm/zvalues 395.3672 and 400.3986, respectively. Ions sharing the same number of C atoms but differing in the number of H and/or D atoms were grouped within a single cluster, indicated by a capital letter. The MS/MS spectrum of stigmasterol‐d5(Plot B)m/zvalues related to ions including D atoms were reported in red. See text for details. The NL numbers represent normalization levels (measured as counts/s) related to each spectrum.

Comparing Figures3and5clearly reveals that product ions in clusters from D to I had the samem/zratios for both CHO and stigmasterol, as well as their deuterated derivatives. This finding supports the structures proposed in Schemes1and/or2for those ions, as none of them involve the SC, where CHO and stigmasterol differ from each other and each of them differs from its isotopically labelled counterpart. Conversely, differences between CHO and stigmasterol were observed for Clusters A, B and C, thus confirming that they are directly related to the terminal part of the SC (see Scheme1). As illustrated in SchemeS1, which compares the structures proposed for relevant product ions of stigmasterol and stigmasterol‐d5, and in FigureS11, where pathways hypothesized for their formation are reported, most product ions in those clusters can be explained by considering the positive charge on C24. Indeed, this position corresponds to a carbocation that is both tertiary and allylic in the case of stigmasterol. Interestingly, the same structure could be hypothesized for them/z69.0699 ion in the case of CHO and stigmasterol (see Schemes1andS1). In fact, this ion results from the loss of the ethyl chain linked to C24 (see FigureS11), where D atoms are located, and which is absent in the case of CHO. On the other hand, them/z83.0855 ion observed for stigmasterol can be explained by three possible structures, all corresponding to stable allylic (in one case also tertiary) carbocations. This interpretation may account for its role as the base peak in the HCD‐FTMS/MS spectrum of stigmasterol (see Figure5A) and highlights this ion as a distinctive marker for the presence of a C=C bond between C22 and C23 and of the ethyl moiety linked to C24. As evidenced in SchemeS1and FigureS11, one of the structures proposed for them/z83.0855 ion was confirmed by the detection of its penta‐deuterated counterpart atm/z88.1169, while the other two were supported by the detection of a tetra‐deuterated product ion atm/z87.1106 and a tris‐deuterated product ion atm/z86.1044 in the MS/MS spectrum of stigmasterol‐d5(see Figure5B, where the peak signals of these ions, in Cluster C, were not labelled with theirm/zratios for the sake of clarity).

It is worth noting that two previous studies reported the detection of am/z83 ion in EI‐MS [58] or MS/MS spectra [59] of stigmasterol, both suggesting structures lacking the ethyl moiety linked to C24.

However, the analysis of stigmasterol deuterated on that group suggests that a different pathway likely generates the ion, at least under conditions related to the so‐called HCD mode. Moreover, as inferred from Figure5Band TableS2, a non‐negligible peak signal was detected for stigmasterol‐d5at am/zratio consistent with the exact value 85.0950 (see TableS2), indicating the generation of a further product ion including four D atoms. As illustrated at the bottom of FigureS11, the structure proposed for this ion would imply the original transfer of a deuteride (instead of a hydride) from C24′ to the original location of positive charge (C3), resulting in a positive charge on C24′. In principle, a further structure for them/z83.0855 ion (not reported in SchemeS1) would be possible for nondeuterated stigmasterol, according to the same pathway.

As mentioned before, comparing CHO and stigmasterol MS/MS spectra (see Figures3and5) revealed significant differences in detectedm/zratios beginning from Cluster J and extending to those with higherm/zratios. These differences can mostly be explained considering product ions previously described for CHO in Scheme2. Indeed, T, S, R and P ions and them/z247 ion of Cluster O described in Scheme2, all including the entire SC, correspond, respectively, to the single ions detected in Clusters V and U and to the minor ions in Clusters T, R and Q (those having nominalm/zvalues 313, 285 and 273) in the case of stigmasterol. The shifts of +26 units in nominalm/zratios are due to the presence of the ethyl group on C24 and the C=C bond between C22 and C23 (see SchemeS1). As expected, the penta‐deuterated counterparts of those five ions were detected in the MS/MS spectrum of stigmasterol‐d5(see red labelledm/zratios in Figure4Band the related structures in SchemeS1). As emphasized in SchemeS1, the positive charge of these ions is likely located on C24, as this is both a tertiary and an allylic carbon in the case of stigmasterol. However, charge remote fragmentations proposed to explain all the five product ions in the case of CHO (with the positive charge located on C17), involving Rings A and/or B of the steroidal backbone, were confirmed (see Schemes2andS1). A detailed representation of fragmentation processes hypothesized to explain the structures of stigmasterol and stigmasterol‐d5product ions reported in SchemeS1and havingm/z> 100 and the positive charge on C24 or C17 is provided, respectively, in FiguresS12andS13of the Supporting Information.

Remarkably, none of the other relevant peak signals detected in clusters from J to T in the case of stigmasterol showed the 5‐unit shift related to the deuteration of the ethyl group in the case of stigmasterol‐d5, indicating the absence of that moiety in their structure. Among them, them/z311 ion of Cluster T and them/z241 ion of Cluster O represented the stigmasterol counterparts of them/z313 and 243 ions proposed for CHO in Schemes1and2, respectively, considering the presence of a C=C bond between C22 and C23 (see SchemeS1). Conversely, structures identical to those proposed for ions with nominalm/z95, 109, 135, 147, 161 and 215 in the case of CHO could be hypothesized for stigmasterol (see Schemes1,2andS1), as the portion of SC differing between the two molecules was absent in their structure.

A more complex evaluation was needed for the remaining product ions detected in the stigmasterol MS/MS spectrum and not showing the expected +5‐unit shift when stigmasterol‐d5was fragmented. Firstly, 395 > 297 > and 400 > 297 > CID‐MS3spectra were acquired by fragmenting them/z297 ion (Cluster S) originated by both stigmasterol and stigmasterol‐d5[M + H‐H2O]+ions. As evidenced in the genealogical trees reported for them/z400.4 ion and for them/z395.4 ion of stigmasterol in FigureS2, both spectra revealed the same features, that is, a series of signals with 14‐units spaced nominalm/zvalues from 269 to 135. As proposed in FigureS14, them/z297 ion (exact value 297.2577) might be generated through a two‐step gas phase process. The first step would involve a cycloelimination, enabled by the C=C bond between C22 and C23 in the stigmasterol SC, with loss of propene; this would be followed by the loss of but‐1‐ene, eventually penta‐deuterated. Additionally, if the positive charge was initially located on C17, as shown in FigureS14, a very stable tertiary/allylic carbocation would finally be formed, thus explaining the significant abundance of them/z297 ion in the MS/MS spectrum of stigmasterol and of its deuterated counterpart (see Figure5). Nonetheless, the same mechanism might occur considering the positive charge on C3, as shown in FigureS15, and the resulting ion, indicated as 297.2577 A in SchemeS1, would coincide with them/z297 ion proposed by Münger et al. [48] as a typical feature of fragmentation for sterols with a C=C bond between C22 and C23, although a different mechanism was hypothesized by those authors. In the present study, the 395 > 297 > and 400 > 297 > CID‐MS3spectra clarified that the entire set of stigmasterol product ions mentioned earlier was preferentially generated by them/z297 ion, as emphasized in the right side of SchemeS1. The detailed fragmentation processes hypothesized for those ions, shown in FigureS15, suggested that even a further structure (297.2577 B in SchemeS1) had to be considered for them/z297 ion with the positive charge on C3 to enable an easier interpretation of all the detected product ions. Notably, them/z255 ion (Cluster P), indicated by Münger et al. [48] as a characteristic product ion arising directly from the [M + H‐H2O]+ions of sterols having a C=C bond between C22 and C23 and another one on the steroidal backbone, was included among them.

In the case of stigmasterol, a general agreement between structures hypothesized for product ions could be made, at least for the nondeuterated sterol, between the present study and the one by Jiang et al. [30], in which the quadrupole‐Orbitrap mass spectrometer was also used. One of the relevant differences was the absence, in the fragmentation scheme proposed by those authors, of product ions still keeping the SC (i.e., ion of clusters from Q to V reported on the right side of SchemeS1), although peak signals potentially corresponding to some of them seemed to be present in the FTMS/MS spectrum reported in Ref. [30]. On the other hand, product ions withm/z< 100 were not considered by the authors since 100 was the lowestm/zvalue explored in their spectrum. As discussed so far in this paper, those lowm/zproduct ions can be very important to clarify the structural characteristics of the SC of sterols; thus, they should be included in the acquired MS/MS spectra of sterols, if possible.

Following stigmasterol, brassicasterol, that is, another Δ5‐sterol including a C=C bond between C22 and C23 and differing from stigmasterol only for the presence of a methyl group, instead of an ethyl one, linked to C24, was examined. This structural similarity is evident in the APCI(+)‐HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra of the respective [M + H‐H2O]+ions, reported in Figures4Cand5A, at least for product ions that did not include the SC portion where the structural difference occurs, namely, all those corresponding to clusters from D to P and them/z297 one (Cluster S, see SchemeS1). Among product ions with higherm/zratios, brassicasterol ions with nominalm/zvalues 325 (U), 311 (T) and 271 (Q) correspond, respectively, to Ions V, U and R detected for stigmasterol (see SchemeS1).

The most notable differences between brassicasterol and stigmasterol spectra were observed for lowerm/zproduct ions, particularly those of Clusters B and C. Indeed, the prevailing product ion observed at nominalm/z83 for stigmasterol (see SchemeS1) became them/z69 ion in the case of brassicasterol due to the replacement of the ethyl group with methyl at C24. Accordingly, them/z69 ion was the most abundant product ion detected for brassicasterol, making it a diagnostic feature to recognize the presence of a methyl group linked to C24 in conjunction with a double bond between C22 and C23.

As illustrated in Figure1, isofucosterol (Δ5‐avenasterol) and Δ7‐avenasterol are isomeric sterols sharing an ethylidene group linked to C24 and differing only for the position of the double bond on Ring B. These compounds were thus studied to evaluate if the different position of that C=C bond might influence sterol fragmentation pathways. The APCI(+)‐HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra for the respective [M + H‐H2O]+ions (exactm/z395.3672) are reported in Figure4D,E. It is important to note that the presence of a C=C bond between carbon atoms C24 and C24′ may favour the localization of positive charge on C25, C23 and C24″, as these would all be allylic carbocations. As shown in Scheme3and FiguresS16andS17, the positive charge on C23 (corresponding to an allylic/secondary carbocation) and on C25 (an allylic/tertiary carbocation) enables an easy interpretation of product ions detected, respectively, atm/z69.0708 and 83.0861 (consistent with exact values 69.0699 and 83.0855) for the two sterols (see Figure4D,E), when considering SC dissociations. However, due to the significantly higher abundance of them/z83.0861 ion in the case of Δ7‐avenasterol, an alternative interpretation was searched for. As a result, the process shown in FigureS18was proposed. Specifically, it involves the preliminary breakage of the C10–C9 bond, mediated by a 1,3 H transfer from C11 to C10 (and the formation of a C=C bond between C9 and C11), followed by the detachment from Ring A of a pentacyclic secondary carbocation with an exactm/z83.0855 and the release of a neutral molecule with an extended C=C bond conjugation. As inferred from FigureS18, this process requires the absence of a C=C bond between C5 and C6, thus explaining why it would be favoured in the case of Δ7‐avenasterol. For the same reason, the process is expected to be hindered also in the case of stigmasterol, thus explaining why them/z83 peak signal was very low in the case of stigmasterol‐d5(see Figure5B). In this case, the specific structure of them/z83 ion proposed for stigmasterol was formed but including the deuterated portion of the molecule, thus leading to a set of product ions with nominalm/zvalues ranging from 85 to 88 (see the upper‐right side of SchemeS1).

Excepting a higher abundance of them/z95 ion in Cluster D for Δ7‐avenasterol, due to the possibility of direct generation from Ring A (see the structure shown in Scheme3and the fragmentation reported in FigureS17), a similar internal abundance distribution was observed for the product ions of clusters from D to G and Cluster I in the case of isofucosterol and Δ7‐avenasterol, with a good accordance also with the corresponding clusters observed for stigmasterol (see Figures4and5A). This result is reasonable, as the three sterols share the same molecular formula (C29H48O), and aligns with the structures proposed for ions of those clusters in Schemes1and2, referred to CHO but also valid for stigmasterol. The shift of the C=C bond from C5–C6 to C7–C8 would still make those structures consistent with the experimentalm/zratios. However, this is not the case of the structure proposed for the important product ion with exactm/z147.1168 (Cluster H) discussed before. As evidenced in Scheme3and FigureS17, the presence of a C=C bond between C7 and C8 would favour the generation of a product ion with exactm/z149.1325 in the case of Δ7‐avenasterol, through a different mechanism involving a bond breakage between Rings A and B and Ring C. This hypothesis was experimentally confirmed, as the prevailing peak signal for Cluster H was detected atm/z149.1323 in the case of Δ7‐avenasterol (see Figure4), making it a diagnostic product ion for the C=C bond location between C7 and C8.

Characteristic differences in relative abundances were observed for further signal clusters when comparing isofucosterol, Δ7‐avenasterol and stigmasterol, starting from Cluster J. In the case of isofucosterol and Δ7‐avenasterol, a signal with anm/zratio compatible with the exact value 175.1481 was predominant, whereas a signal compatible with the exactm/zvalue 173.1324 showed the highest abundance for stigmasterol. As shown in Scheme3, the structure proposed in Scheme1for them/z175 ion, with the positive charge located on C3, would be valid for both isofucosterol and Δ7‐avenasterol. In contrast, the structure having an exactm/zratio of 173.1324 proposed for stigmasterol in SchemeS1would necessarily require the presence of a C=C bond between C5 and C6. A higher abundance can thus be predicted for this product ion also in the case of isofucosterol, compared to Δ7‐avenasterol, although it does not become more abundant than them/z175.1481 ion. This hypothesis was confirmed by the MS/MS spectra of the two compounds (see Figure4). It is worth noting that an alternative structure was proposed for them/z175 ion in the case of CHO, with the positive charge located on C17 and involving the breakage of the C20–C22 bond (see Scheme2). This structure is essential to explain the characteristic abundance of this product ion observed for sterols lacking a C=C bond between C22 and C23, namely, CHO, campesterol, β‐sitosterol, isofucosterol and Δ7‐avenasterol (see Figures3and4), and its low abundance for sterols including that C=C bond, namely, stigmasterol and brassicasterol (see Figures4Cand5). The breakage of the C20–C22 bond leading to them/z175 ion with positive charge on C17 requires a 1,3 H transfer from C23 to C20. This process is significantly more difficult if C23 is involved in a C=C bond, as in stigmasterol and brassicasterol.

While comparing further product ions obtained for isofucosterol and Δ7‐avenasterol, an interesting inversion in abundance was observed for ions with nominalm/zvalues of 187 and 189 in Cluster K. As illustrated in Scheme3, this finding can be explained by the easier generation of them/z187 ion in the case of isofucosterol since the C5–C6 double bond is already present and an additional C=C bond is formed between C8 and C14 during fragmentation (see FigureS16). Similar internal patterns were generally observed for clusters from L to V for the two species (see Figure4), the only differences being an increased abundance of them/z215, 257 and 297 ions in the case of Δ7‐avenasterol. This finding aligns with the structures reported for ions in those clusters in Schemes1,2andS1, as the position of the C=C bond on Ring B is not expected to affect their validity. On the other hand, the increased abundance of the three specific ions cited before suggests that the C=C bond between C7 and C8 can positively influence their generation due to the different molecular conformation induced by that position. More generally, this conformational effect might also explain the higher relative abundance of product ions with respect to the residual precursor ion observed for Δ7‐avenasterol compared to isofucosterol (see Figure4).

The interpretation of fragmentation spectra for 4‐desmethyl sterols discussed in the previous sections revealed subtle differences despite their general similarity. These differences might help in identifying the occurrence of specific structural features. This idea is highlighted by the comparison of relative intensities typically observed for all product ions related to the sterols considered during the present study, reported in TableS3of the Supporting Information.

Table1summarizes the most informative product ions, linking specific structural features to intensity relationships or percent intensities, based on the fragmentation spectra. This table might be employed to assess structural features like the position of the double bond on Ring B, the presence of a double bond on the SC (either between C22 and C23 or on the branch linked to C24) and the occurrence of an alkyl group linked to C24 by carefully considering the intensity ratios existing between peak signals in specific clusters or, in some cases, the relative intensity in the entire spectrum.

Summary of correlations between specific structural features and intensity relationships for the most structurally informative product ions of 4‐desmethyl‐sterols, grouped according to clusters shown in Figures3,4and5.

Note:The correlations are based on HCD‐FTMS/MS and CID‐MSn(n= 2–4) analyses of selected standards. Exactm/zvalues rounded to four decimal places are reported. Percentages correspond to relative intensities observed in the MS/MS spectrum.

Combining this information with the precursor ionm/zratio and the differences inm/zratios observed between its peak signal and nearby signals in the MS/MS spectrum, reflecting neutral losses occurring on the SC, might aid in identifying unknown plant sterols in vegetal samples.

The complex fragmentation patterns obtained for 4‐desmethyl‐sterols when subjected to positive ion MS/MS were thoroughly analysed using natural and isotopically labelled standard compounds. The study employed a complementary approach using accuratem/zvalues of MS/MS peak signals provided by a high‐resolution mass spectrometer, insights gained from multistage mass spectrometry (MS3–MS4) using a linear ion trap and comparisons of product ionm/zratios between natural and isotopically labelled standards. The intricate nature of 4‐desmethyl‐sterols MS/MS spectra was found to arise from a combination of factors, the most relevant being the existence of multiple potential locations for the positive charge, which, to the best of our knowledge, was evidenced for the first time for sterols. This feature was likely caused by the occurrence of unique intramolecular hydride transfers that displaced the positive charge of the original carbocation formed during the APCI process upon protonation of the OH group and subsequent loss of a H2O molecule, thus located on the carbon atom conventionally numbered as C3. In particular, indirect evidence was obtained for an alternative location of positive charge on carbon atoms conventionally labelled as C17, on the steroidal backbone, and C24/C25, on the side chain, due to their stabilization as tertiary carbocations. As a result, multiple fragmentation pathways were proposed to account for all detected product ions, with some ions possibly having several structures consistent with theirm/zratios. The investigation highlighted the important role played by low (< 100)m/zproduct ions, mainly arising from the side chain, and by product ions generated from the sterol [M + H‐H2O]+precursor ions through small neutral losses occurring from that chain, related to C‐C bond breakages. Despite they had not received a specific attention in previous studies, those ions proved very useful to infer the structural characteristics of the side chain (location of the C=C bond, nature of the substitution at C24). Indeed, significant correlations were found between the intensity ratios of selected product ions among them and the characteristics of the SC. Other diagnostic correlations between intensity ratios or percent intensities and structural features were found for product ions whose generation was influenced by the position of the C=C bond on Ring B.

These insights provide a foundation for identifying unknown sterols in complex samples, such as plant extracts, and might thus contribute to a deeper understanding of this important class of metabolites.

For the sake of clarity, the transfer of H, with concurrent breakage of a C‐C bond and the formation of a new C=C bond is depicted explicitly only in the first process drawn in the scheme.

Figure S2.Genealogical trees constructed for sterol [M + H‐H2O]+ions to describe the information inferred from HCD‐FTMS/MS and CID‐MS3/MS4acquisitions performed, respectively, using a quadrupole‐Orbitrap and a linear ion trap mass spectrometer. Them/zratio of the precursor ion involved in the HCD‐FTMS/MS acquisition is reported on top of each tree and is then connected to boxes representing them/zratios and percentual relative intensities observed in the HCD‐FTMS/MS spectrum, for the resulting product ions that were subsequently subjected to CID‐MS3acquisitions (note that the same set of product ions was observed in HCD‐FTMS/MS and in CID‐MS/MS spectra of sterol [M + H‐H2O]+ions). Each of those boxes is then connected to a series of boxes describingm/zratios and relative intensities observed for ions detected in CID‐MS3spectra. Among the latter, boxes withm/zratios and relative intensities written in blue colour represent precursor ions selected for subsequent CID‐MS4acquisitions. In this case, the set ofm/zratios of major peak signals detected in the MS4spectrum was not explicitly indicated since it corresponded to the set inferred from the MS3spectrum acquired on the same precursor ion and reported in one of the genealogical trees for the same sterol. Notes: (1) Them/zratios of ions including D atoms in their structures are written in red character; (2) the letter adopted to mark each product ion cluster in FTMS/MS spectra has been reported also for all ions inside the trees; (3) for the sake of consistency, allm/zratios have been rounded to the first decimal place, in accordance with the precision level available with the linear ion trap mass spectrometer.

Figure S1.Mechanisms hypothesized to explain the generation of lowm/z(< 100) product ions shown in Scheme1from the [M + H‐H2O]+ions of cholesterol (CHO) and of cholesterol (CHO‐d6) completely deuterated on the methyl groups linked to C25. For the sake of clarity, the transfer of H, with concurrent breakage of a C‐C bond and the formation of a new C=C bond is depicted explicitly only in the first process drawn in the scheme. Nonetheless, the C‐C bond broken as a consequence of this process is highlighted in all fragmentation reactions using a transversal dashed line. Exactm/zratios, rounded off to the fourth decimal place, are reported.

Figure S2.Genealogical trees constructed for sterol [M + H‐H2O]+ions to describe the information inferred from HCD‐FTMS/MS and CID‐MS3/MS4acquisitions performed, respectively, using a quadrupole‐Orbitrap and a linear ion trap mass spectrometer. Them/zratio of the precursor ion involved in the HCD‐FTMS/MS acquisition is reported on top of each tree and is then connected to boxes representing them/zratios and percentual relative intensities observed in the HCD‐FTMS/MS spectrum, for the resulting product ions that were subsequently subjected to CID‐MS3acquisitions (note that the same set of product ions was observed in HCD‐FTMS/MS and in CID‐MS/MS spectra of sterol [M + H‐H2O]+ions). Each of those boxes is then connected to a series of boxes describingm/zratios and relative intensities observed for ions detected in CID‐MS3spectra. Among the latter, boxes withm/zratios and relative intensities written in blue colour represent precursor ions selected for subsequent CID‐MS4acquisitions. In this case, the set ofm/zratios of major peak signals detected in the MS4spectrum was not explicitly indicated since it corresponded to the set inferred from the MS3spectrum acquired on the same precursor ion and reported in one of the genealogical trees for the same sterol. Notes: (1) Them/zratios of ions including D atoms in their structures are written in red character; (2) the letter adopted to mark each product ion cluster in FTMS/MS spectra has been reported also for all ions inside the trees; (3) for the sake of consistency, allm/zratios have been rounded to the first decimal place, in accordance with the precision level available with the linear ion trap mass spectrometer. The figure follows in the next seven pages.

Narrow fitting footwear is a modifiable risk factor for the development of hallux valgus (HV). Despite this, the pressure that footwear exerts at the medial forefoot has not been fully evaluated in people with HV. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether the toe box of footwear habitually worn by women with HV is associated with pressure exerted on the medial forefoot.

In‐shoe peak pressure and maximum force at the medial forefoot (distal and proximal sites) were recorded from 28 women (mean age 60.7 years, SD 10.7) with moderate or severe HV using the pedar pad pressure system (Novel GmbH, Germany). The shape (width and area) of the participants' most symptomatic foot and toe‐box of their usual footwear was determined using an INFOOT 3D laser scanner (I‐Ware Laboratory, Japan) and hand tracing, respectively. The difference between the foot and corresponding footwear measurements as well as differences in the magnitude and timing of peak pressure and maximum force between the proximal and distal forefoot were determined using independentt‐tests. Correlations between forefoot pressures with toe‐box differential were determined using Spearman'sρanalyses.

Peak pressure and maximum force were significantly greater (mean difference [MD] = 33.0 ± 15.4 kPa;p< 0.001 and 12.8 ± 7.3 N;p= 0.001) and occurred slightly later in the stance phase at the distal forefoot compared to the proximal forefoot (MD = 6.0 ± 6.9%;p= 0.083 and 6.9 ± 6.8%;p= 0.045, respectively). There were no significant correlations between toe‐box differential and medial forefoot pressures, with all correlations less than 0.35 (p> 0.05).

Toe‐box shape and fit of footwear typically worn by older women with painful HV was not associated with increased medial forefoot pressures in this study sample. Therefore, changing the toe‐box width and area of the usual footwear worn by older women with painful, moderate or severe HV may not necessarily reduce medial forefoot pressures where footwear does not appear to play a role.

Hallux valgus (HV) is a common foot condition characterised by the medial deviation of the first metatarsal and lateral deviation of the hallux, resulting in progressive subluxation of the first metatarsophalangeal joint and a medial prominence of the forefoot [1]. The prevalence of HV is greater among females and is estimated at 23% in adults and 36% in older adults (aged over 65 years), indicating an increase with age [2]. HV is associated with reduced hallux strength [3,4], impaired balance [5,6] and increased risk of falls [7,8]. Both general and foot‐related quality of life progressively decline with increasing HV severity [9,10].

Ill‐fitting footwear is a potentially modifiable risk factor for HV [11,12]. Between 63% and 72% of people wear inappropriately sized footwear and are consequently more likely to have foot pain and foot disorders [13]. The primary footwear feature implicated in HV development is a narrow toe box (the section of footwear that surrounds the toes), particularly among women [14,15]. Moreover, among women, the development of HV is significantly associated with the use of a narrow toe box between the ages of 20–39 years [11]. This suggests that footwear commonly worn by people who develop HV does not follow the contour of the forefoot and that the toes may adapt to footwear shape, thereby contributing to the onset and progression of the deformity.

Despite several studies examining plantar pressures associated with HV [16], only one study has investigated the effect of the toe‐box shape on medial forefoot pressures in women with HV [17]. This study reported no significant difference in peak pressures at the medial first metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal joint with round toe‐box footwear compared to participants' own footwear. However, the shape of participants' own footwear was not reported in this study. Two studies have investigated medial forefoot pressures among other populations and, in contrast, found a relationship between the toe‐box shape and medial forefoot pressures [18,19]. Among women without HV, peak pressures at the medial first metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal joints were significantly reduced when wearing footwear with a round toe box compared to a square or pointed toe box [19]. Similarly, among both men and women with foot pain, peak pressures at the medial first metatarsophalangeal joint were significantly reduced when wearing footwear with a round, wide toe box compared to participants' own footwear [18].

The contrast between populations with and without HV indicates that there is still little understanding of the relationship between toe‐box shape and medial forefoot pressures in HV, although individuals with HV are known to have difficulty with finding comfortable footwear [4]. In addition, all three studies collected pressure data by securing discrete sensors to predetermined locations on the foot with an adhesive tape [17,18,19]. Limitations of this method of data collection are the possibility of sensor placement error [20] and movement of the sensor during data collection.

Evidence for a relationship between toe‐box shape and fit and medial forefoot pressures in HV is limited and suggests that further investigation is necessary to better understand interventions for the prevention and management of HV pain and deformity. The objectives of this study were therefore to (i) quantify in‐shoe pressures at the distal and proximal medial forefoot (corresponding to the first interphalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints) in women with HV using a novel matrix pressure sensor and (ii) examine the association between these pressures and forefoot toe‐box differential. We hypothesised that there would be a positive association between first interphalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joint pressures and forefoot toe‐box differential, indicating that the wearing of relatively narrow shoes would increase medial pressures.

This cross‐sectional study was nested within a randomised feasibility trial for the effectiveness of a multifaceted non‐surgical intervention for HV. The data were collected during the baseline assessment for this trial. A protocol of the trial and the main findings have been published [21,22,23]. Reporting of this study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines [24]. Ethical approval was granted by the La Trobe University Human Ethics Committee (reference HEC20474). Informed written consent was obtained from all participants. The feasibility trial was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN12621000645853).

Participants were recruited using posters in the local community, email correspondence to staff of the La Trobe University School of Allied Health, Human Services and Sport, postal invitation to patients of the La Trobe University Health Sciences Clinic and Facebook advertising targeting women in the local area with painful HV and offering treatment free of charge. Inclusion criteria were (i) female, (ii) ≥ 40 years of age, (iii) first metatarsophalangeal or interphalangeal joint pain rated three out of 10 on a zero to 10‐point scale for at least 12 weeks, (iv) HV scored two or more on the Manchester scale [25] equating to moderate or severe HV, (v) capability to ambulate household distances greater than 50m without walking aid and (vi) ability to understand verbal and written English. Exclusion criteria were a history of (i) HV surgery, (ii) neurological disease impacting ambulation, (iii) inflammatory rheumatological conditions (e.g., gout, psoriatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis), (iv) lower limb or partial foot amputation, (v) lower limb or back injury that interferes with reaching the feet or (vi) treatment with arch‐contouring orthoses or foot exercises (stretching, mobilisation and strengthening) in the last 12 weeks. The decision to recruit solely women was due to their higher prevalence of HV [2] and tendency to wear narrow footwear [13].

The sample size was determined by the feasibility trial, which did not require full power to detect statistically significant differences between groups. The recommended sample size for feasibility and pilot trials is 12 participants per group [26]. Twenty‐eight participants were recruited to account for a 15% drop‐out rate. The sample of 28 was sufficient to detect a correlation between toe box shape and fit and medial pressures of at least 0.22 (significance level 0.05, power 0.80) [27].

A structured interview was conducted to collect data on participant demographic characteristics (age, education level, ethnicity, primary medical conditions and medications used), anthropometrics (height, weight and body mass index [BMI]), general health and foot health (Short Form 12 questionnaire [28], Incidental and Planned Exercise Questionnaire [29] and the Manchester–Oxford Foot Questionnaire) [30] and clinical features (severity of HV deformity, side affected, pain duration and pain severity) [21,22].

To document foot dimensions, an INFOOT 3D laser scanner (I‐Ware Laboratory, Japan) was used. Scans were taken in a weight‐bearing position, with the weight evenly distributed between each foot. Participants could use an upright bar for support if required. The INFOOT 3D laser scanner has been validated against radiographs and clinical measurements and found to be reliable for the majority of parameters [28]. From these scans, an outline of participants' feet was produced as a vector image. Forefoot width was defined as the length of a line connecting the most medial point of the first metatarsophalangeal joint and the most lateral point of the fifth metatarsophalangeal joint and forefoot area was defined as the area created by the footprint from this line to the distal end of the longest digit.

Participants were asked to bring the closed‐toe footwear they wore most often. To document toe‐box shape, an outline of each shoe's sole was traced onto blank paper and scanned in a flat‐bed scanner. If the outsole was appreciably wider than the upper of the shoe, the outline was adjusted to approximate the true upper dimensions using a visual estimate after tracing was completed. This method has been successfully used in a previous study [15]. Toe‐box width was defined as the length of a line connecting the most medial point of the forefoot of the shoe and the most lateral point of the forefoot of the shoe, and the toe‐box area was defined as the area created by the outline of the shoe from this line to the distal end of the shoe. To compare foot and footwear shapes, a vector image of the participants' footwear was superimposed over a vector image of the participant's foot using Canvas 11 (ACD Systems, Miami, FL, USA). See Figure1. To quantify the difference in shape (referred to as the toe‐box differential), two measurements were taken: first, the difference in width at the level of the metatarsophalangeal joints (hereafter referred to as forefoot width differential); second, the difference in area taken between the level of the metatarsophalangeal joints and the distal end of the longest digit (hereafter referred to as forefoot area differential).

In this study, we defined ‘medial forefoot’ as two masks corresponding to the first metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal joints and measured these using the pedar pad (Novel GmbH, Munich, Germany), a flexible strap of 56 sensors with an active area of 70 mm × 160 mm and resolution of 0.5 sensors/cm2. The pedar pad is a novel device but uses the same pressure distribution measuring system as the pedar‐X, which has previously been found to be a valid, reliable and accurate measure of in‐shoe pressures [31]. Once the strap was secured to the foot as shown in Figure2, and the participant's shoes were fastened, the pedar pad was zeroed by asking participants to raise their foot. Participants then completed four 6‐m walking trials at a self‐selected speed. Following the trials, it was checked that the pedar pad remained in place. If the participant had bilateral HV, the foot with the greater symptomatic severity was used. To minimise the confounding effect of variability in walking speed on the pressure data, a trial was repeated if the walking speed differed by more than 5% of the original trial. The middle four steps from each trial (i.e., a total of 16 steps) were used for analysis to prevent acceleration and deceleration from influencing the data. Sixteen steps has been shown to provide reliable measurements [31]. Plantar pressure data were averaged within the pedar pad Novel scientific software, and peak pressure (defined as the highest pressure value recorded in a mask region, measured in kPa) and maximum force (defined as the highest force value recorded in a mask region, measured in N) were documented. The sensor area was divided into two mask regions: mask 1 (distal forefoot, which included two rows of sensors and corresponded to the first interphalangeal joint) and mask 2 (proximal forefoot, which included three rows of sensors and corresponded to the first metatarsophalangeal joint).



Pedar pad placement in footwear during walking trials.

Statistical analysis was undertaken using IBM SPSS Statistics version 26.0 (IBM Corp, NY, USA). All data were explored for normality. Differences between distal and proximal peak pressure and maximum force were compared using independent samplest‐tests. Associations of distal and proximal forefoot peak pressure and maximum force with the forefoot width and area differential were investigated using the Spearman's rho (ρ) correlation coefficient. The following interpretation of correlations was used: 0 to 0.25 indicated little or no relationship, > 0.25 to 0.50 indicated a fair relationship, > 0.50 to 0.75 indicated a moderate to good relationship and > 0.75 indicated a good to excellent relationship [32]. In all analyses,p< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Individual peak pressure and maximum force recordings were time‐normalised using code written in R software incorporating linear interpolation and then graphed using Canvas 11 (ACD Systems, Miami, FL, USA) to analyse timing over the stance phase.

A total of 28 participants were recruited for the pilot and feasibility trial and all were included in this study. Participant characteristics are shown in Table1. The group had a mean (SD) age of 60.7 (10.7) years and BMI of 27.2 (4.2) kg/m2. The most frequent ethnicity of participants was Oceanic/Australian (n= 13, 46%). Most participants displayed bilateral HV (n= 23, 82%) and at least moderate deformity (moderaten= 19, 68%; severen= 9, 32%). The sample was physically active according to their responses to the Incidental and Planned Exercise Questionnaire.

Short Form 12 Health Survey (SF‐12): scores ranged from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better function.

Manchester–Oxford Foot Questionnaire (MOXFQ): scores range from 0 to 4 for each domain, with 4 indicating greater pain and for the MOXFQ‐Index scores, score ranges from 0 to 100, 100 indicating greater pain.

Visual analogue scale (VAS): scores ranged from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating worse pain.

Forefoot width was greater than toe‐box width in 10 cases (36%) and narrower in 18 cases (64%). The mean (SD) forefoot width was 102.4 mm (6.0) and the mean (SD) toe‐box width was 99.8 mm (7.9). This difference was not statistically significant (mean difference [MD] = 2.6 mm, 95% CI = −1.1 to 6.4;p= 0.168). The forefoot area was smaller than the toe‐box area in 27 cases (96%) and greater in one case (4%). The mean (SD) forefoot area was 42,435 mm2(8861) and the mean (SD) toe‐box area was 56,260 mm2(13,825). This difference was statistically significant (MD = −13,825 mm2, 95% CI = −20,047 to −7603p< 0.001).

Peak pressure and maximum force at the distal and proximal forefoot are shown in Table2. Peak pressure (MD = 33.0 kPa, 95% CI = 17.7 to 48.4;p< 0.001) and maximum force (MD = 12.8 N, 95% CI = 5.5 to 20.1;p= 0.001) were significantly greater at the distal compared to proximal forefoot. Peak pressure and maximum force at both the medial forefoot regions over stance phase are shown in Figures3and4, respectively. Time to peak pressure at the proximal and distal forefoot occurred at 73.7% (17.8) and 79.8% (10.2) of stance phase, respectively. This difference was not statistically significant (MD = 6.0%, 95% CI = −0.8 to 12.9;p= 0.083). Time to maximum force at the proximal and distal forefoot occurred at 73.3% (17.5) and 80.2% (10.1) of stance phase, respectively. This difference was statistically significant (MD = 6.9%, 95% CI = 0.15 to 13.7;p= 0.045).

Width differential = difference between the width of the forefoot and the width of the toe box, with a greater/positive value indicating the forefoot is wider.

Area differential = difference between the area of the forefoot and the area of the toe box, with a greater/positive values indicating the forefoot is larger.



Peak pressure (kPa) at the medial forefoot over stance phase. The following intervals for subphases in stance phase were used: loading (0%–20% of stance), midstance (> 20% to 52%), terminal stance (> 52% to 83%) and pre‐swing (> 83% to 100%).



Maximum force (N) at the medial forefoot over stance phase. The following intervals for subphases in the stance phase were used: loading (0%–20% of stance), midstance (> 20% to 52%), terminal stance (> 52% to 83%) and pre‐swing (> 83% to 100%).

Correlations between peak pressures during walking and measurements of toe‐box dimensions are shown in Table2. There was little to no relationship between distal forefoot peak pressure and forefoot width differential (ρ= −0.15,p= 0.443) and a fair nonstatistically significant relationship between proximal forefoot peak pressure and forefoot width differential (ρ= −0.27,p= 0.172). There was little to no relationship between distal forefoot peak pressure and forefoot area differential (ρ= 0.13,p= 0.503) and little to no relationship between proximal forefoot peak pressure and forefoot area differential (ρ= 0.16,p= 0.427).

Correlations between maximum force during walking and measurements of toe‐box dimensions are shown in Table2. There was little to no relationship between distal forefoot maximum force and forefoot width differential (ρ= −0.10,p= 0.634) or proximal forefoot maximum force and forefoot width differential (ρ= −0.08,p= 0.680). There was little to no relationship between distal forefoot maximum force and forefoot area differential (ρ= 0.23,p= 0.244) and a fair nonstatistically significant relationship between proximal forefoot maximum force and forefoot area differential (ρ= 0.35,p= 0.065).

In this study, we used a novel technique to measure in‐shoe medial forefoot pressures in women with HV, with the aim of determining whether the shape of the toe‐box influences these pressures during walking. We found that peak pressure and maximum force occurred slightly earlier during late stance phase at the proximal forefoot compared to the distal forefoot. However, we found only little to fair, nonstatistically significant relationships between toe‐box dimensions and medial forefoot pressures, suggesting that the two‐dimensional shape of the shoes (as measured using length and area differential) worn by our sample may not influence medial forefoot loading in HV. Interestingly, the shoe toe‐box area was significantly larger than the foot, so it is possible that the shoes worn were not overly constrictive in most of our participants.

Our findings that significantly greater peak pressure and maximum force occurred at the distal forefoot compared to the proximal forefoot are in contrast to previous studies that reported greater peak pressure at the first metatarsophalangeal joint compared to the first interphalangeal joint [18,19]. This disparity may be due to differences in methods to obtain pressure data. Previous studies used discrete sensors to obtain pressure data, whereas we used a matrix device. The matrix device provides a large area for pressures to be detected, compared to discrete sensors that detect pressure at isolated regions and may move during testing.

Our findings that the relationships between toe‐box shape and medial forefoot pressures were weak and not statistically significant were unexpected, given that narrow‐fitting footwear is considered an important risk factor for the development of HV [11]. In accordance with our findings, the only other study among people with HV found no significant difference in pressures at the medial forefoot between participants own footwear and footwear with a round accommodative toe box [17]. Notably, this study and our own included people with moderate or severe HV (none had no or mild HV), who may self‐select footwear that does not increase pressure on their HV deformity. Indeed, because our sample had symptoms for some time, many had already changed their footwear to make it more comfortable. We also did not control for the compliance of the materials used for the upper of participants' footwear and noted that in some participants, the upper of the shoe was already stretched as a result of their HV. Indeed, a relationship between pressure and upper material flexibility has previously been suggested [33].

The clinical implication of our study is that changing the toe‐box width and area of the usual footwear worn by older women with painful, moderate or severe HV may not necessarily reduce medial forefoot pressures, particularly if the footwear has been worn for a long period of time. As such, footwear selection for this group needs to consider all facets of footwear, including duration of wear and upper materials, and not width or area alone. Furthermore, our findings suggest that generic footwear advice should not be the only management provided for HV, but be part of an individualised, multimodal approach including orthotic devices and muscle strengthening/retraining exercises [34].

Our study has several strengths. First, this is the first study to investigate medial forefoot pressures among people with HV using a matrix style device. This reduced the risk of measurement error due to sensor migration and placement error that can occur with discrete sensors [35]. Second, participants were representative of people who most frequently present with HV based on age and sex [2]. Third, we normalised timing to stance phase duration, which has not been done in previous studies. Finally, we investigated medial forefoot pressures using participants' own footwear, which improves the external validity of our findings.

Although this study has several strengths, the findings must be interpreted in the context of its limitations. First, the pedar pad is a novel approach to measuring in‐shoe pressures, but further investigation of the reliability and validity of this system is required. The pedar pad is bulkier than discrete sensors and was difficult to adhere to the foot in participants who wore very tight shoes. Peak pressures may have been underestimated due to the need to zero the device when the shoe is worn, and the pedar pad is only able to document perpendicular forces. Second, our participants were drawn from a pilot and feasibility trial. Consequently, our sample was relatively small, and our results may not be generalisable to the broader population of people with HV. As stated previously, our sample wore shoes that were not overly constrictive, which may explain why we only found weak relationships between toe‐box dimensions and medial forefoot pressures. Third, we did not consider the flexibility of the deformity, and it is possible that pressures may vary depending on the available range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal joints. Fourth, hand tracing of footwear dimensions may not have optimal accuracy compared to three‐dimensional foot scanning. Finally, as this is a cross‐sectional study, causal relationships cannot be inferred.

Further research is required to better understand the relationship between toe‐box dimensions and medial forefoot pressures in HV. Investigating other methods for measuring footwear characteristics such as thickness and the pliability of the upper may yield valuable insights. Future studies would benefit from larger sample sizes and a greater variety of age groups. Of particular interest would be younger women, as women with HV are more likely to report wearing footwear with a constrictive toe box between the ages of 20 and 39 years [11]. In addition, comparison of people with various stages of HV may provide insights into how HV severity modulates in‐shoe medial forefoot pressures. Furthermore, longitudinal studies may expand our understanding of the temporal relationship between footwear shape, medial forefoot pressures and HV development.

In conclusion, our study demonstrated that peak pressure and maximum force were greater and peaked slightly later during late stance phase at the distal forefoot compared to the proximal forefoot during level walking in women with moderate or severe painful HV. Notably, there were no statistically significant relationships between toe‐box shape and medial forefoot pressures during walking. These findings demonstrate that older women with painful HV may self‐select footwear with appropriate toe‐box fit and shape to accommodate their deformity, and therefore management recommendations for HV should include tailored multimodal approaches, beyond education to wear wider fitting footwear.

Tongue necrosis is a rare manifestation of Group A Streptococcal (GAS) infection. Only certain strains of GAS have been found to cause invasive disease in the form of necrotising skin and soft tissue infections. We present the case of an older woman who developed a sore throat and localised ulcer on the tongue, that rapidly progressed to lingual necrosis and spreading erythema in the neck and chest. Owing to rapid detection, she received timely surgical treatment and intravenous antibiotic therapy, making a full recovery. This report describes the unique presentation of lingual necrosis in GAS infection. It highlights the diagnostic challenges and emphasises the importance of early recognition of symptoms.

Giant cell arteritis, ischaemia, and vasculitis are the most common diseases associated with tongue necrosis [1]. The tongue and other facial structures are rarely reported to be affected by Group A Streptococcal (GAS) infection. The primary lineage associated with invasive disease in Europe and the USA is the GAS emm1 strain [2]. Research suggests that mutations within this strain, can increase its virulence and transform it into a superantigen. These mutations have been found in cases of giant cell necrosis, haemorrhagic pneumonia, and streptococcal toxic shock [2].

A 60-year-old woman presented with a 3-day history of sore throat and a localised ulcer on the right side of the tongue. She applied benzocaine cream to the tongue for pain relief but subsequently developed progressive swelling of the tongue, as well as odynophagia and trismus. Her medical history included psoriatic arthritis controlled with etanercept and a dental root extraction performed 1 month previously.

On presentation to the emergency department, she was hypotensive and had a blood pressure of 80/50 mmHg and a heart rate of 100 beats/min. She was initially treated for anaphylaxis with two doses of adrenaline and 3 litres of fluid boluses. However, because she was unable to maintain her blood pressure, metaraminol was required for cardiovascular support. She was afebrile and maintained 95% oxygen saturation with 2 L of oxygen. Wheezing, stridor, or immediate airway compromise was not observed. Physical examination revealed right-sided lymphadenopathy and minimal erythema over the anterior chest wall (Fig. 1).



Stages of progression of chest wall erythema. (A) Extensive erythema spreading across the neck and chest. (B) Chest decompression with multifocal drainage points. (C) Appear 4 months after initial presentation.

Fibreoptic nasoendoscopy revealed significant swelling in the right hypopharynx and submandibular area extending to the upper neck, with patent airway and trachea. There was significant bluish-brown discolouration and swelling of the tongue, accompanied by shedding of the superficial epithelium (Fig. 2). Elective endotracheal intubation was performed due to the high risk of airway compromise.



Stages of progression of lingual necrosis: (A) ulcerated, necrotic and ischaemic area of the tongue (necrotising fasciitis/myositis). (B) Right partial glossectomy defect after debridement. (C) Completely mucosalised tongue 4 months after initial presentation.

Head and neck computed tomography (CT) showed no radiological features of fulminant or gas-producing necrotising fasciitis. Neither mediastinitis nor deep neck space collection were evident. However, there was reduced attenuation and poor enhancement of the tongue mucosa. Laboratory tests were normal except for relative leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 2.6 × 109/l and an elevated C-reactive protein level of 132 mg/l.

She was admitted to the intensive care unit with suspected lingual vasculitis and a secondary infection. However, admission blood cultures revealed a GAS infection, specifically with the emm1 strain. The maxillofacial team promptly performed an emergency debridement in the form of a partial right glossectomy, and incision and decompression of the neck and chest. Early diagnosis and timely intervention made it possible to avoid neck and chest skin excision.

Post-operatively she remained intubated for 9 days and was managed in the intensive care unit. There she underwent a 6-day course of co-amoxiclav, followed by a 5-day course of benzylpenicillin and clindamycin for targeted therapy (Fig. 3). She underwent two additional planned examinations and washouts under anaesthesia as part of her comprehensive management plan.



Antibiotic susceptibility report for Group A streptococcus (GAS) blood culture, showing susceptibility to all tested antibiotics.

After 17 days of hospitalisation, she was discharged home. At the 4-month follow-up, she was in good condition, showing no evidence of residual swelling or erythema. The tongue defect had completely mucosalised, and there was no loss of skin on the neck or chest.

GAS is one of the most commonly isolated organisms in patients with necrotising fasciitis [3].

Risk factors that predispose people include diabetes mellitus, chronic renal disease, alcoholism, and an immunocompromised state [4]. It arises from trauma or distant haematogenous spread. In this case, immunosuppression due to etanercept treatment was a significant risk factor.

The diagnosis of necrotising soft tissue infection (NSTI) is challenging and depends on the judgement and experience of clinicians. Swelling, erythema, and disproportionate pain should raise suspicion of NSTI. The presence of blisters, bullae, and skin crepitus is a strong indication [5]. Most infections do not result in skin or soft tissue necrosis; however, those that do are associated with a high mortality rate [5]. In immunocompromised patients, physical examination findings are often subtle, and laboratory results are non-specific, further complicating the diagnostic process. Nevertheless, ecthyma gangrenosum and haemorrhagic pustules developing into necrotic ulcers are the most common signs of necrotising infections in these individuals [6].

Surgical exploration remains the gold standard for NSTI diagnosis. Early and comprehensive surgical debridement is crucial to control the infection [5]. Delays in initial debridement are often linked to poorer outcomes, whereas immediate surgery typically results in a shorter stay in intensive care and hospital [5]. In this case, timely surgical debridement limited the necrosis to the tongue, and spared the overlying skin.

CT scans can be helpful in diagnosing NSTI. However, less than half of CT patients show gas tracking in the fascial planes [7], a characteristic feature for the diagnosis of necrotising infection.

The first line antimicrobial agent for GAS infection is penicillin. The patient should initially be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, followed by targeted therapy if a specific pathogen is identified. Clindamycin is a valuable adjunct to penicillin and offers numerous benefits in the treatment of necrotising fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome [5]. The optimal duration of treatment is not clearly defined, but should continue until surgical debridement is complete, clinical improvement is achieved, and fever has resolved for 48–72 h [5].

This case highlights the need for greater awareness of NSTIs among healthcare professionals. For clinicians, immediate surgical referral and early antibiotic therapy are of paramount importance for potentially saving patients’ lives.

The Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC) in Qatar manages 31 health centres serving a diverse population of over 1.7 million people. PHCC is fully committed to providing people‐centred care. Patients are routinely asked to complete satisfaction surveys. The surveys have shown continued shortcomings in patients' perceptions of communication with staff.

Focus groups with patient and staff groups, which together represent about 70 nationalities, were a useful method for learning how each group perceives communication in primary care settings in Qatar.

Patients and staff identified many of the same communication issues. Patients were clear about their expectations to be seen and treated quickly, whereas staff groups were aware of the demand on the primary care system and the difficulties in meeting patient expectations.

The focus groups identified potential subjects for improvement of patient–staff communication, including how patients are welcomed when they arrive at a health centre and for a consultation, and patients' needs to better understand their health concerns and management through asking questions and explaining back to a clinician their understanding of what has been explained to them.

The Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC) in Qatar manages a network of 31 health centres, catering to a diverse population of over 1.7 million people with more than 4 million health centre visits annually. PHCC is committed to delivering people‐centred care, and its approach has been recognised by Accreditation Canada with the People‐Centred Care Commitment Award [1].

PHCC health centres' patients and staff represent nearly 70 nationalities and speak many languages. This diversity presents unique challenges to communication among patients and staff. Staff training has continuously included communication with patients, and quality improvement projects have been carried out on aspects of communication with patients. Nonetheless, PHCC patient satisfaction surveys consistently revealed serious shortcomings in patient perceptions of the quality of communication between patients and clinical staff.

To address the continuous challenge of negative feedback about communication from patients, PHCC initiated an improvement collaborative involving all primary care centres aimed at enhancing patient–staff communication. At the start of the collaborative, the authors carried out a realist review of research on patient–staff communication in primary care settings. The review identified interventions, such as greeting a patient, encouraging a patient to ask questions about health, using digital health technologies, teach‐back, staff training and quality improvement projects that have been demonstrated to improve the outcome of patient satisfaction, particularly patient perceptions of communication with healthcare professional staff. The review highlighted, however, that most research on communication between patients and clinicians in primary care settings has been carried out in North American and European countries and Australia, and therefore, may not be generalisable to Qatar.

Although PHCC primary care staff were trained in communication skills, it was uncertain if the specific communication interventions identified in the realist review were being used or were suitable for use in primary care settings in Qatar. Therefore, the next stage in the improvement collaborative was to learn more about the communication issues facing patients and staff in Qatar and whether the communication interventions identified by the evidence base would be appropriate for implementation in the PHCC health centre context.

Focus groups have been used widely in the healthcare system in Qatar as a qualitative approach to learning the experiences, perceptions and opinions of people concerned with an issue. Studies that have used focus groups with patients in Qatar have been on: adherence to a Step Into Health programme; meeting the needs of autistic adults; healthcare needs of Arabic speaking primary care patients; self‐management of type 2 diabetes; living with menopause and perceptions of mothers toward oral health services for children [2,3,4,5,6,7]. Studies in Qatar using focus groups with healthcare professionals have explored facilitators and barriers to medication error reporting and causes of errors; medical management of older adults; appropriate antibiotic prescription; interprofessional collaboration and perceptions of narcotic use in patients with cancer [8,9,10,11,12,13].

Focus groups have also been used to explore communication issues with patients in primary healthcare settings in other countries, including: the use of teach‐back with children; communication with patients with medically unexplained symptoms and communication with patients from different cultures [14,15,16]. However, we could not find studies carried out in Qatar or another Middle Eastern country that explored communication issues between patients and staff and possible interventions intended to improve communication.

By focusing on real‐life experiences and perceptions of patients who receive and of staff who deliver healthcare services [17], the focus groups were intended to bridge the gap between work (communication)‐as‐imagined (WAI) and work (communication)‐as‐done (WAD) by staff [18]. The focus groups were aimed at informing the suitability of the communication interventions identified by the realist review and setting priorities for implementation of those interventions that could be valued by patients and staff. By directly involving those most affected by communication practices, PHCC could ensure that any proposed changes in communication practices were contextually appropriate and grounded in the actual needs and preferences of its diverse patient and staff populations.

The design and analysis of the focus groups followed the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) [19].

The purposes for the focus groups were to learn directly from patients and staff working in the PHCC health centres: (1) how patients and staff experience communication with each other and (2) what patients and staff perceive as issues related to communication that could be addressed by one or more interventions identified from the evidence base.

Objectives for the focus groups with patients and staff were to learn how patients and staff perceive communication with each other with examples of good and ‘could be better’ communication; if patients felt listened to when they were explaining their problems and staff perceptions of listening to patients; patients' knowledge of and attitudes towards digital health technologies and staff support of these technologies with patients; if patients understand what has been explained about a patient's condition and how staff know if patients have understood their explanations; perceptions of the cultures of or languages spoken by staff; and what would improve communication with each other. The objectives were derived from the communication issues addressed by the interventions identified in the realist review.

To include patients and staff from health centres in all geographic regions in Qatar and to enable health centres in each region to be represented in the focus groups, 9 focus groups with patients and 9 focus groups with staff were conducted. Each focus group was intended to include up to 15 participants.

Patient focus groups included: adult patients from various age groups, Qataris and non‐Qataris, both genders and people who are capable, willing and available to participate in a focus group. Patients who may feel sensitive in front of other people because of their medical condition were excluded from being invited. Staff groups included physicians, dentists, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists, laboratory staff, radiology staff, health centre managers, receptionists, customer service staff (called hayyak), administrative staff and regional directors. Patients and staff were solicited to attend the focus groups at the health centre level by members of the PHCC patient engagement team. Arrangements for the focus groups were confirmed by the PHCC patient engagement team with all the participants.

The focus groups were carried out face‐to‐face on consecutive working days in September 2023, with 1–3 focus groups conducted each day. The groups were designed to require 1 h or slightly longer depending on the discussion among the participants, but no more than 1.5 h. The focus groups were scheduled for 1.5 h to allow for arrival and departure of participants.

Complete protocols for the conduct of the patient and staff focus groups were developed by the authors and approved by PHCC before the conduct of the groups. The questions and prompts to be used in the focus groups were derived directly from the objectives for each set of focus groups. The questions and prompts were translated into Arabic to be used by the staff moderating the focus groups carried out in Arabic.

The focus groups carried out in English were moderated by two authors who were trained and highly experienced in carrying out focus groups with patients and healthcare staff. Focus groups carried out in Arabic were moderated by Arabic‐speaking members of the PHCC patient engagement team, trained by experienced moderators. 11 focus groups were in English and 7 in Arabic, 6 with patients and 1 with customer service, reception and administrative staff. None of the moderators had any previous relationship with any of the focus group participants. The focus groups were held in multipurpose rooms in three health centres located in different regions. Participants were seated around tables arranged in a boardroom style.

All focus groups were audio recorded. The recording was explained carefully by the focus group moderators to all participants in each focus group, emphasising that the recording was going to be used only for the purpose of analysis of the content of the discussion in the group and especially that no individual would be identified in any way in the report. Each group was explicitly asked to consent to the recording, and all groups agreed. One group of patients requested that they introduce themselves by name on the recording for the sake of transparency, as explained by the patients; none of the names of patients participating in this group were captured in the data analysis. For all other groups, the participants were invited to introduce themselves before the recording device was switched on, and participants were not referred to by name throughout the recorded discussion.

All focus groups conducted in English were transcribed using Sonix and Otter.ai software. The accuracy of each transcript was verified by the authors listening to each recording and amending the software‐generated transcript for accuracy as needed. Three software packages for transcribing Arabic to English were tried; none produced transcripts for which the English was completely understandable. Therefore, the Arabic recordings were transcribed by professional Arabic to English translators, with these translators and their employing agency signing a comprehensive confidentiality agreement on the content of the recordings.

The transcripts became the data sources for analysis of the patient and staff focus groups. In addition, notes taken by the moderators during the focus groups were used to identify particularly strong points of discussion or nonverbal communication that could be expressing a view on a subject.

The framework method for the analysis of qualitative data was used to analyse the focus group transcripts [20]. Transcripts of the interviews were broken down by protocol question. Two of the authors independently read the content relating to each question in the focus groups and labelled the responses, which became codes. Codes used were to identify generally positive or negative comments about communication with staff or with patients and keywords or phrases expressed by participants in the focus group that elaborated on the positive or negative comments or reflected dominant experiences or opinions about an aspect of communication. Codes were extended for subjects for which there was extensive discussion. The analysts discussed instances of disagreements on the coding of transcript content and resolved any differences. A spreadsheet was used to summarise by codes the themes of responses to each of the focus group questions, as well as any noteworthy comments.

Although the moderators of the focus groups asked the questions directly related to the focus group objectives, the patient groups tended to expand the scope of the focus groups to include their concerns and experiences about using the health centres. The additional subjects raised by the patients were also included in the analysis.

Eight of the patient focus groups represented patients from different regions in Qatar. The ninth group was made up entirely of members of the PHCC Patient and Family Advisory Group (PFAG). In total, of 136 patients invited, 65 patients participated in the 9 focus groups, with between 4 and 11 patients in each group. At the start of most patient focus groups, patients spontaneously expressed their gratitude for the availability of and free access to the health centres and for being invited to contribute their ideas about communication between patients and staff working in the health centres. Many patients praised the services they had received from a health centre and the way some staff working in a health centre treated them.

Patients responded to the moderator questions about communication with staff in the health centres. However, they also brought up problems they experienced with getting information on using the health centres, for example, how to renew a health card, get an appointment with a hospital specialist or obtain medications for complex conditions, because not every health centre stocks all medications.

Eight themes were derived from the analysis of the patient focus groups.

Patients' theme 1—Wanting to be welcomed or greeted on arrival—How patients are received at the health centres was the subject that the patient groups talked about most. They emphasised the importance to patients of being welcomed and greeted on arrival at a health centre, with staff making eye contact with a patient, smiling, and speaking with a patient in a kind way. The patients made a point about Qatar being an Islamic country and that it is in the culture to be welcoming and hospitable, and they wanted this culture to be demonstrated in the health centres.

Patients' theme 2—Not sharing clinical information with nurses—Patients don't want to divulge clinical information in physical spaces in a health centre where others can overhear their information. The spaces where patients are triaged by nurses are not sufficiently private for the patients. However, nurses perceived that patients don't want to share clinical information because they don't respect the nurses.

Patients' theme 3—Not knowing where to go—Patients said they don't always know where to go for a service in a health centre, and they may walk around the health centre looking for the room they are supposed to go to. Sometimes they just open a physician's closed door to confirm that they are in the right place.

Patients' theme 4—Some doctors and some nurses are not good at communication with patients—Patients commented that some staff don't make eye contact with the patient, don't explain, don't listen or don't want the patient to ask questions.

Patients' theme 5—Not always understanding the information they are given by a healthcare professional—Patients explained that they do not always understand the information being explained by a physician or another member of staff, particularly about their medications.

Patients' theme 6—The language barrier—Patients discussed what happens when the patient and the physician don't speak the same language, specifically that Google Translate is not helpful, and they don't want staff interpreters because of their concerns about privacy and confidentiality.

Patients' theme 7—Preferences for digital health technologies—Patients would like the PHCC to ask patients which digital health technologies they prefer to use, and then for PHCC to use those technologies with a patient.

Patients' theme 8—Communication is a management issue—The PFAG specifically made the point that communication is a management issue, and problems about communication should be addressed by the health centre manager.

The patients' key themes are further explained in Table1.

Patient perceived communication issues with health centre staff.

The space where the nurse sees the patient in some health centres is not sufficiently private, and someone outside the area can hear the conversation.

Sometimes, staff leave the door open, and people sitting outside can hear everything.

Patients don't always know where to go and where to wait for each room number; they requested a map of room numbers for the health centres.

Some patients don't wait to be invited into a physician's consulting room and walk into the room as soon as the last patient exits.

Patients perceive that some physicians are not good communicators.

Patients perceive that some triage nurses seeing walk‐in patients don't communicate well with patients.

The physicians whom patients see as not good communicators don't make eye contact with the patient, don't explain the patient's condition or why tests are being requested, don't really listen to the patient (possibly because they are pressed for time), or don't seem to like the patient asking the physician questions. When the physician lacks communication skills, the patient often returns to a health centre to see another physician and get another opinion.

The nurses who don't communicate, according to the patients, don't smile or interact with the patient before taking the patient's vital signs.

In addition to issues related to communication with health centre staff, the patients brought up systems issues relating to getting fast appointments with a physician, registering and obtaining a health card, understanding how the ‘walk‐in’ (urgent care) system works (that a patient triaged as not urgent may be given an appointment to be seen later), and lengthy waiting to see a physician or get a medication in a health centre. They also discussed the mixture of roles of health centres, trying to be both family medicine centres and urgent care centres, and the fact that the patients miss the experience of the family medicine model. The patients also expressed some confusion about how the healthcare system in Qatar works, for example, that patients can't book an appointment with a hospital specialist through the call centre that handles appointments at health centres and that such an appointment needs to be a referral from a health centre physician.

The patients commented on the Arab and Middle Eastern culture in which people speak directly to the point, expressing what they want. They were candid in discussing their expectations for the provision of healthcare services. They said: ‘We want everything, and we want it now.’ Many staff members interpreted the patient's approach as: ‘Shouting is the patient's language.’

Of 130 staff members invited, 76 staff participated in the focus groups. The groups were organised by staff category: physicians and dentists (27 attending three groups); nurses and allied health professionals (18 attending two groups); pharmacists (9 attending one group); radiology and laboratory staff (7 attending one group); admin, customer service and reception staff (7 attending one group); and regional directors, health centre managers and leads (8 attending one group).

Staff participating in the focus groups often described how they attempt to communicate with patients using communication skills. However, they acknowledged the communication problems experienced with patients. Eight themes were identified from the staff focus groups.

Staff theme 1—Communication skills staff should apply—Physicians in the focus groups described communication with patients as a skill with principles to follow and develop through practice. They described communication as the most important part of the dialogue between a clinician and the patient and as a part of treatment. They referred to the patient expecting the physician or dentist to be a good listener without interrupting the patient. They also described setting an agenda with the patient at the beginning of the consultation, learning all the issues the patient is raising and negotiating with the patient about how the patient's problems will be handled in the consultation. The physicians acknowledged that communication with a patient takes time, which may be hard for physicians when they are expected to see many patients in a shift. They also stated that improving the patient experience with better communication required all staff working in the health centre, not just the physicians or dentists.

Nurses and physiotherapists also discussed the importance of smiling, greeting the patient, listening to the patient and trying to make the patient comfortable, getting up from their chair to open the door and welcome the patient, as well as providing information for the patient and using open‐ended questions to get the patient to talk about his or her concerns. Regional and health centre managers discussed the importance of greeting and welcoming patients to a health centre, with staff members introducing themselves to patients and making eye contact with patients.

Staff theme 2—Patients not always understanding the information they are given by a healthcare professional—Pharmacists discussed the importance of teaching the patient about the medication prescribed, including why it has been prescribed, for how long and what could happen if the patient stopped taking the medication, and being sure that the patient has understood the pharmacist's explanation. Pharmacists also pointed out that communication with a patient takes time, and sometimes the pharmacy is so busy, there isn't time to have this type of communication with each patient. They also commented that many patients do not want to engage with the pharmacist about their medications.

Laboratory and radiology staff referred to sources of misunderstanding by patients about their services, such as the need for patients to complete a required preparation for some investigations or that not all investigative services can be carried out in every health centre and that patients may have to travel to another health centre for some investigations. The admin, customer service and reception staff also discussed the importance of patients' understanding how the health centres work and having access to information about the health centres' administrative systems.

Staff acknowledged that they may not explain information in a way the patient understands, and the patient can make a return visit to a health centre or go to another member of staff to ask questions.

Staff theme 3—Patient lack of understanding of the health centres and staff roles—The physicians and managers both discussed the patient's lack of understanding of the role of PHCC and the health centres, citing that they overhear patients talking on their phones and telling people they are at the hospital. They discussed the confusion that has emerged from adding urgent care to the health centres, when the previous model had been to deliver family medicine with families having a designated physician responsible for their care, and that the urgent care concept now dominates the way the health centres tend to be working and physicians can't maintain continuity of care with their patients.

The healthcare professional staff groups all commented that patients don't seem to understand the professionals' roles and that patients tend to have a highly simplified view of what these staff actually do in their jobs. For example, laboratory staff expressed that patients think that all they do is collect blood and put it into a machine; the patients ask the staff directly for the results from the machine. Pharmacists said that patients think that all pharmacists do is take medications from the shelves and give them to the patient. Physiotherapists commented that patients do not understand that much of what a physiotherapist does is teach patients to manage their own conditions.

Staff theme 4—The language barrier—All the staff groups acknowledged the communication difficulties when staff members and patients don't speak the same language. Staff try to find a member of staff who speaks the patient's language to help; however, the physicians mentioned that staff serving as interpreters need to be trained for this role. They also mentioned that patients seem to value staff members differently, depending on the nationalities of the patients and staff, and that it is valuable for staff to know the social norms for the nationalities of patients they treat, for example, culturally acceptable and unacceptable gestures.

Staff theme 5—Patients not knowing where to go—Staff acknowledged that patients are sometimes sent to the wrong location upon arrival at a health centre. When patients want an immediate appointment, the call centre may direct patients to a health centre they have not previously attended and therefore, the patients don't know where to go. Also, the call centre can send patients to a health centre that does not offer the service the patient wants, for example, a dental appointment or an investigation not carried out in all health centres.

Staff theme 6—Patients not sharing information with nurses—Patients don't want to disclose their personal details, saying it is all in the patient's record, and they don't know why nurses are asking them to verify their identity. Also, they don't want to give clinical information to nurses carrying out triage for urgent care, or they give different versions of their symptoms to ‘pass’ triage and get to see a physician quickly.

Staff theme 7—Teamwork among staff—The staff groups also made the point that communication among staff members affects the quality of communication with patients. They referred to the need for all staff groups working in a health centre to improve their communication with each other, especially across nationalities and services. The intent expressed was to work as a team delivering care to patients, specifically improving communication among staff groups about the patient ‘pathway’ in a health centre; patient demands for clinically inappropriate services; services or medications not available at all health centres; or referrals for inappropriate therapies for some patients.

Staff theme 8—Management support—Staff groups referred to the need for management support to facilitate communication between patients and staff, particularly for management to take a balanced approach when a patient complains and to support staff when they follow PHCC policies.

Further explanations of the issues staff groups raised about communication between patients and health centre staff are in Table2.

Staff perceived communication issues with patients.

In the focus groups with patients and staff, it is notable that many of the communication‐related themes raised by patients and staff were the same or highly similar, although they were expressed somewhat differently by patients and staff, as summarised in Table3.

Communication‐related similar themes discussed by both patients and staff.

Patients don't always feel they are welcomed, helped and respected by the reception and greeter function at the health centres.

Patients don't always know where to go and where to wait for each room number; they requested a map of room numbers for the health centres.

There can be miscommunication with patients when they arrive at a health centre or a lack of direction for the patient.

Patients attend health centres where the staff have no previous experience with the patients and where the patients are not registered.

Patients don't want to tell the nurses why they have come to the health centre.

Patients perceive that some triage nurses seeing walk‐in patients don't communicate well with patients.

Some patients attending the urgent care service don't want to tell the triage nurse why they have come to the health centre, or they give different versions of their symptoms to different staff members.

Patients don't want to disclose their name and date of birth, and some patients are offended when staff ask.

Patients perceive that some doctors are not good communicators.

Some patients aren't clear about instructions for taking their medications or why a medication is being changed or stopped.

Some doctors don't fully explain the patient's health condition or management plan.

Patients make unnecessary quick return visits to a health centre or go to a nurse or a pharmacist in the same visit to ask questions.

Patients don't talk with the pharmacist about medication.

Some patients don't complete the required preparation for some investigations, such as bowel preparation or fasting.

Patients refer to using Google Translate when a physician and the patient don't speak the same language.

Patients may not welcome having an interpreter when the doctor or nurse doesn't speak their language.

A clear issue that emerged from both the patient and staff groups was about patient expectations and the implications of patient expectations for the staff's delivery of services. Patients were clear that they wanted to be seen quickly by a physician in a health centre, and any delays in getting appointments were enormously frustrating to patients. Patients had various strategies for getting around the delays, such as coming to a health centre as a ‘walk‐in’ patient and then ‘making a fuss’ if the triage nurse determined that they did not need to be seen urgently and could be given a routine appointment, or making several calls to the call centre to get an appointment, or taking an appointment at a different health centre from the one where they are registered just to have a quick appointment.

On the other hand, staff were frustrated that the urgent care service was tending to dominate the daily workload for clinical staff and that it was challenging to maintain family medicine services when physicians needed to see patients presenting for urgent care. Staff were deeply concerned that when some patients are not seen immediately, even when they have minor self‐limiting illnesses or they just wanted a ‘check‐up’, the patients turn to the health centre's complaint system to achieve their objectives. Staff can feel defensive about making clinically appropriate decisions for patients when the complaint system is used in this way by patients.

Some of the themes in the focus groups are consistent with the barriers to interprofessional collaboration identified among healthcare professionals in primary care centres in Qatar, specifically that patients are reluctant to provide information to healthcare professionals other than the physician; they see the physician as ‘the pinnacle health professional’; and they want to be mainly seen and examined by physicians. In the same study, staff participants perceived a lack of understanding of other healthcare professionals' scope of practice. In addition, they reported concerns about the prevalence of a ‘blame culture’ when something is seen as going wrong [12].

Nonetheless, these focus groups were helpful in pointing to directions for improvement of communication between patients and health centre staff. In addition to training all staff to acquire and apply effective communication skills such as maintaining eye contact, smiling and listening, specific projects for improvement could be identified as needed from the themes in the focus groups. These projects included welcoming and greeting patients; encouraging patients to ask questions about their health and answering the questions; and doing more to help patients understand the health‐related information about their care, which staff were providing to patients through the intervention of teach‐back. This analysis of the key communication‐related issues led PHCC to involve all the health centres in these three improvement projects: welcoming and greeting patients to the health centre and to every service in the health centre; encouraging patients to ask questions about their health and management plans; and using teach‐back to confirm that when patients are given information about their condition and their management plans, patients fully understand the explanations.

Some of the patients' behaviours, identified by both the patients and staff, concern a lack of understanding of the primary care health system, management of patients' health conditions and treatment, including using medications as prescribed. The concept that underpins these issues is health literacy. The level of health literacy in the Qatari population does not seem to be known; however, basic or limited health literacy levels of 21% in the United States [21], 43% in the United Kingdom [22], and 47.6% in European Union countries [23] are unlikely to be exceeded in Qatar, given the diversity of the population. The improvements in encouraging patients to ask health‐related questions and teach‐back are intended to achieve the outcome of improved patient perception of communication in the primary care centres because these interventions are addressing the underlying context of low health literacy in primary care centres in Qatar. The intended improvement of welcoming patients reflects the patients' perception of the Qatari culture and reminds staff to treat patients with kindness.

Focus groups with patients and primary care centre staff in Qatar identified key issues related to patient–healthcare professional communication in health centres in Qatar. Several issues were shared between the patients and staff, including the importance of welcoming and greeting patients in every service in a health centre; patients' lack of understanding of how the health centres work, especially in the delivery of urgent care; patients don't always understand what healthcare professional staff explain to them; and the importance of patients' sensitivity about discussing their health problems or medications with various healthcare professional staff. The issues related to welcoming a patient, encouraging patients to ask questions and using teach‐back to ensure that patients understand what has been explained to them were identified as subjects for the improvement collaborative on patient‐centred communication involving all the health centres.

Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most common and serious manifestations of
systemic lupus erythe-matosus (SLE) and is recognized as the strongest
predictor of poor prognosis. This study aims to analyze demographic
characteristics, clinicopathological corre-lations, and risk factors
associated with renal outcomes in a long-term follow-up of patients with
LN.

This is a retrospective observational cohort study from 112 biopsy-proven LN
patients, followed from July 1985 to August 2015. We have evaluated risk
factors associated with renal impairment (doubling of serum creatinine),
end-stage renal disease (ESRD, eGFR <15 mL/min) and cumulative renal
damage using the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/ACR
Damage Index (SDI).

The median time of follow-up was 8.3 years. Class IV LN predominated (64.3%),
alone or in combination. There was a statistically significant increase in
the renal score of SDI between 5 and 10 years of follow-up. In the
multivariate analysis, final SDI correlated with initial eGFR <75 mL/min
(p < 0.001) and proteinuria >3.5 g/24 h during the course of the
disease (p < 0.001), overcoming parameters identified in uni-variate
analysis as using cyclophosphamide (p = 0.010) and not using antimalarials
(p = 0.003); 13.4% of the patients progressed to renal function impairment,
and 11.6% to ESRD.

Accumulated renal damage by SDI was a frequent finding. The main determinants
of renal outcome were baseline eGFR <75 mL/min and proteinuria >3.5
g/24 h during follow-up. Thus, early diagnosis and better management of LN,
especially in case of high levels of proteinuria, may help improve
prognosis.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, multisystem autoimmune disease of
the connective tissue1. Renal involvement in SLE, lupus nephritis (LN), is frequent and is also one
of the most serious manifestations of SLE. It affects up to 60% of adults with the
disease; the incidence depends on the population studied, with a higher incidence in
Asians, Afro-descendants and Hispanics2,3,4. LN is recognized as the strongest predictor of a poor prognosis, since it is
associated with a significant increase in mortality2,3,4,5,6. Approximately 50 years ago, the median five-year survival of patients with
LN was 44%; it improved dramatically to approximately 82% by the 1990s. Such a
decrease in mortality is due to better knowledge of the disease, leading to earlier
diagnosis and better and more aggressive therapeutic management2,4,7.

Despite improving the course of the disease, treatment may be prolonged, potentially
toxic, and difficult to plan and maintain8,9. Both treatment and disease activity over time can result in permanent damage
to different organs and lead to dysfunction, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) in
the case of LN. For some authors9,10, the identification of predictors of cumulative damage is of great importance
to improve SLE outcomes. In this context, the Systemic Lupus International
Collaborating Clinics/ACR Damage Index (SDI) is a validated instrument to measure
irreversible damage in SLE patients9. In fact, short-term survival of patients with SLE has improved, but
irreversible organ damage accumulates during the course of the disease, contributing
to impaired quality of life and increased long-term mortality. Thus, patient
management should aim not only to increase survival but also to reduce morbidity
caused by the disease and its therapy10. This can be in part evaluated by indexes like SDI, that can provide
additional information in the follow-up of patients with LN.

The average incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in 10 years of follow-up is
15% and may reach 25−30% in 15 years11,12,13,14,15. Lack of remission of LN with treatment is probably one of the most important
predictors of progression to CKD. Other risk factors for renal impairment have also
been established and include male gender, low socioeconomic status, ethnicity
(Afro-descendants and Hispanics), presence of crescents in more than 50% of the
glomeruli in renal biopsy, proliferative classes (III and IV) and their treatment
with corticoids alone, not using antimalarials, high initial serum creatinine,
nephrotic proteinuria, hypertension, anemia, and complement consumption16,17,18,19. Such characteristics tend to vary according to each study, since there are
differences in outcome definitions, populations, and duration of follow up, making
it difficult to extrapolate findings.

Previous studies on outcomes in Brazilian patients with LN showed that initial
proteinuria and serum creatinine levels, as well as initial response to treatment
and chronicity on kidney biopsy were related to worse outcomes20,21,22. We analyzed demographic characteristics, clinicopathological correlations,
and risk factors associated with renal outcomes in a long-term follow-up, including
loss of renal function, ESRD, and cumulative damage in a longitudinal cohort of
biopsy-proven LN patients.

We analyzed retrospective data from medical records of patients with a diagnosis of
SLE according to the revised criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)
and histopathological diagnosis of LN, followed up at the Division of Nephrology
(Section of Glomerulopathies) of the Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP), a
tertiary and academic reference center in São Paulo, Brazil. The patients included
were followed from July 1985 to August 2015. LN was classified according to the
World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Society of Nephrology/Renal
Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) classifications23. Patients of both genders, 12 years of age or older, and with a time of
follow-up equal to or greater than one year were included.

The following variables were evaluated: age at the onset of follow-up, gender, blood
pressure, serum creatinine, proteinuria, hematuria, antinuclear and anti-double
stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies, complement consumption, laboratory and
clinical manifestations of SLE, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
determined using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula,24and biopsy reports. The type and duration of treatment and the time of onset
of infections were also recorded.

Renal impairment was defined as at least doubling serum creatinine level and ESRD as
eGFR <15 mL/min (CKD stage 5) or when renal replacement therapy was required. We
also assessed renal damage using the SDI9. This instrument has already been validated and applied in various
populations and ethnicities and evaluates the nonreversible damage related to SLE
and its treatment in 12 organs or systems9,10,25. Damage in the renal system according to SDI was defined as one of the
following: 1) estimated GFR <50 mL/min (score: 1); 2) persistent nephrotic-range
proteinuria ≥ 3.5 g/24 h (score: 1); and ESRD (score: 3). All patients had the SDI
assessed at 1 year and at the end of follow-up; 34 patients who were followed for a
longer period also had the SDI assessed at 5 and 10 years.

Statistical analyses were initially performed descriptively (means, medians,
percentages), then inferential tests were applied when necessary and cited in the
Results section. P-values lower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Analyses were carried out using R software version 3.0.2. (R Core Team, 2016).

A total of 112 patients were included, with a median follow-up time of 99.9 months
(range 12−322). The mean age was 31 ± 10.8 years, 83.9% were females, and 54.8% were
white. The baseline characteristics are shown inTable 1.

The predominant clinical manifestations of SLE associated with LN were hematological
(80.4%), especially anemia (74.1%), followed by complement consumption (68.8%), and
joint involvement (67%). Hematuria >100,000/mm3at presentation of
renal disease occurred in 52 patients (53.1% of those with hematuria) and at the end
of follow-up in six patients (11.1% of those with hematuria at this stage). At
presentation, the laboratory profile showed elevated serum creatinine (mean of 1.62
mg/dL) and proteinuria >3.5 g/24 h in 49% of the patients and, at some point in
the course of disease, in 72% of the patients.

The distribution of the histological classes of LN was as follows: 3.57% class II,
7.14% class III, 64.29% class IV, 23.21% class V, and 1.79% class VI. A combination
of classes occurred in 11 patients, all with class IV, and 8 of them were class
IV+V. For simplicity, the latter were all categorized as class IV.

Hypertension was diagnosed in 76.8% of the patients, requiring only one or two
antihypertensive medications for control in most cases. All patients had received
steroids during follow-up; 53.6% of the patients had received intravenous
cyclophosphamide, 19.6% oral cyclophosphamide, 47.3% azathioprine, 41.1%
mycophenolate (mofetil or sodium), and 62.5% antimalarials (chloroquine or
hydroxychloroquine). Treatment with azathioprine was more common in patients with
class II LN (p = 0.047). In class IV, the most commonly used treatments were
intravenous cyclophosphamide (p < 0.001) and mycophenolate (p = 0.003), while
these treatments were less used among patients with class V (p = 0.006 and p =
0.011, respectively). Infections of the upper respiratory tract were associated with
the use of oral cyclophosphamide (p = 0.034).

Compared to the other LN classes, class IV LN (Table
2) was associated with worse renal function at baseline, higher initial
serum creatinine (p < 0.001), and lower initial eGFR (p < 0.001), as well as
more frequent detection of renal activity criteria, such as initial and follow-up
hematuria >100,000/mL (p < 0.001), immunological activity with a higher
frequency of anti-dsDNA positivity (p < 0.001), and more frequent detection of
hypertension (p = 0.028). Class IV also presented more ESRD at the end of the
follow-up when compared with the other classes (p = 0.003).

Notes

bMann-Whitney

cPearson Chi-squared.

Among the patients with class V LN, initial serum creatinine was lower (p = 0.002),
initial eGFR was higher (p = 0.003), initial (p < 0.001) and follow-up levels of
hematuria (p < 0.001) were lower, and there was less frequent anti-dsDNA
positivity (p < 0.001); final eGFR > 15 mL/min was more frequent (p =
0.003).

During the follow-up, 15 (13.4%) patients presented renal function impairment
(doubling of serum creatinine). The profile of patients who had worsening of renal
function until the last year of follow-up did not present a statistically
significant difference in univariate statistical analyses when compared with those
who did not.

Thirteen patients (11.6%) progressed to ESRD. In univariate analysis, patients who
developed ESRD had higher baseline serum creatinine (p < 0.001) and serum
creatinine higher than 1.2 mg/dL (p = 0.001) at presentation; they were also more
frequently submitted to dialysis for acute renal injury in the follow-up (p =
0.033), had more proteinuria >3.5 g/24 h during the course of the disease (p =
0.010), more hematuria above 100,000/mL (p = 0.032), and more classes IV (p = 0.003)
and V (p = 0.033).

Fifty-one (45.5%) patients had a score of at least 1 for renal damage in SDI. Of
those 51 patients who had kidney damage, 29 (56.8%) scored for having eGFR <50
mL/min, 19 (37.2%) scored for maintaining proteinuria ≥ 3.5 g/24 h, and 13 (25.4%)
scored for ESRD. Thirty-four patients were followed-up for a longer period and had
information for evaluation of SDI renal damage in 5 and 10 years, and 4 (11.8%) had
an increase in the score over time. In the inferential comparison of the SDI scores
between 5 and 10 years, a statistically significant increase was found in such
scores (p = 0.046).

The final SDI renal damage score was also correlated with the profile of the patients
in order to identify associated risk factors (Table
3). Univariate inferential results revealed that patients with baseline
serum creatinine >1.2 mg/dL (p < 0.001), with baseline eGFR <75 mL/min (p
< 0.001), who were submitted to dialysis for acute renal injury (p = 0.002), with
proteinuria >3.5 g/24 h during the course of the disease (p = 0.013), with class
IV LN (p = 0.010), who used intravenous cyclophosphamide (p = 0.010), and who did
not use antimalarials (p = 0.003) had the highest SDI renal damage scores. The final
SDI score correlated with initial serum creatinine levels (Spearman correlation
coefficient, s = 0.406, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the
factors that were independently correlated with the final SDI were eGFR<75 mL/min
at presentation (p < 0.001) and proteinuria >3.5 g/24 h during the course of
the disease (p < 0.001).

The development of CKD and ESRD in LN is an important concern in the follow-up of
these patients. In 1997, Medicare data in the United States indicated that LN was
the main diagnosis in 2% of dialysis patients and in 5% of renal transplant patients26. The risk of CKD in patients with SLE has decreased in the last decades,
coinciding with the evolution of treatment, a greater knowledge of the disease, and
earlier diagnosis. From 1970 to the mid-1990s, the absolute risk of CKD fell by
about 10%27. There was also an improvement in the incidence of ESRD in patients with LN
over time, from approximately 16% in the 1970s and 1980s to 11% in the 1990s and
2000s, but there are indications that this incidence has since reached a plateau24.

Some previous studies have focused on finding risk factors related to renal function
impairment and ESRD, and the results tend to vary considerably12,13,14,15,16,27,29,30,31. Our study evaluated demographic characteristics, clinicopathological
correlations, and risk factors associated with renal outcomes in a cohort of
Brazilian patients with LN, who were followed for a median time of 8.3 years. The
mean initial serum creatinine of our population was 1.62 mg/dL, which shows that a
considerable number of our patients started follow-up with impaired renal function.
Previous studies in patients with SLE considered that serum creatinine was altered
at baseline when its value was equal to or greater than 1.2 mg/dL, and this occurred
in 32 to 39.3% of the cases on average27,28. In our sample, 50% of patients had an initial serum creatinine ≥1.2 mg/dL.
Similarly, almost half of the patients (49.1%) had proteinuria >3.5 g/24 h at
onset and the vast majority of the patients (72.3%) had proteinuria >3.5 g/24 h
at least once during follow-up. Undoubtedly, all these aspects demonstrate the
severity of the presentation of LN in the population that we evaluated. It is
important to remember that the Division of Nephrology (Section of Glomerulopathies)
of the UNIFESP is part of a large tertiary hospital and receives patients from all
over the country, often referred due to serious and complex conditions, which may
partly explain the type of presentation reported, in addition to the greater
severity of the disease.

Nevertheless, we found a relatively low frequency of progressive CKD in our
population, consistent with previous studies. Up to the last year of follow-up,
baseline serum creatinine doubled in 13.4% of patients. In addition, the profile of
patients who had worsening renal function did not present a significant difference
when compared to those who did not worsen. Previous studies report a widely variable
CKD incidence of 8.9 to 44%8,13,25,27,29,32,33.

When analyzing the SDI renal damage score, 45.5% of the patients had a score of at
least 1. This index was much higher than that found when studying a population with
SLE in general and not specifically with LN as we did. In previous studies with SLE,
renal involvement occurred in 11 to 23.3% of the patients24,34. Our data shows that a baseline serum creatinine > 1.2 mg/dL, baseline
eGFR <75 mL/min, dialysis due to acute renal injury during follow-up, proteinuria
>3.5 g/24 h during the course of the disease, class IV LN, use of intravenous
cyclophosphamide, and non-use of antimalarials were risk factors for renal damage in
SDI in the univariate analysis. However, multivariate analysis demonstrated that
only eGFR <75 mL/min at the onset and proteinuria >3.5 g/24h along the course
of the disease remained as independent risk factors. The final SDI score correlated
with initial serum creatinine levels.

There is already sufficient evidence that the damage measured by SDI is a predictor
of survival as well as of future damage25,35,36and that the domain of renal damage has a greater relationship with decrease
in survival than other domains25,36. Both the initial renal function deficit and proteinuria have been pointed
out countless times as predictors of worse renal outcome, as confirmed in the
present study. Studies with large cohorts31,32have concluded that reduction of proteinuria is the factor that exerts the
greatest influence on renal prognosis. Minor trials identified nephrotic levels of
proteinuria during the course of disease as an independent factor to define renal prognosis15,37. The vast majority of studies have shown that the initial serum creatinine or
the presence of initial renal function deficit are risk factors for progression to ESRD12,13,16,29,30. Thus, there is a consensus that proliferative classes deserve a more
aggressive treatment when there is elevated serum creatinine and/or nephrotic proteinuria13.

Other risk factors considered to be predictors of renal survival, such as gender and
histological classes of LN, were not associated with worsening renal function in our
study. In fact, even LN class IV did not remain a predictor of worse prognosis in
the multivariate analysis in our sample. Although proliferative classes are often
cited as a risk factor, there are some important trials that have not found such association8,27. It is possible that in recent years, the early identification and
institution of intensive immunosuppressive treatment adopted in such cases have
changed the role of this variable in the current course of LN. It is of note that
the use of antimalarials has also gained support recently, with evidence suggesting
association of a lower rate of kidney damage and a lower rate of ESRD18,19. Nevertheless, we found this association only in the univariate analysis.

The development of ESRD, defined as eGFR <15 mL/min, independent of the need of
dialysis or renal transplantation, occurred in 11.6% of the patients. Data on the
incidence of ESRD vary considerably, as well as the characteristics of the
populations studied, making it difficult to compare populations. In general, reports
about the development of ESRD in LN patients range from 8 to 30%12,25,27,28,38,39,40. Patients in our sample that progressed to ESRD presented significantly
higher initial serum creatinine, as well as more frequent serum creatinine levels
>1.2 mg/dL, proteinuria >3.5 g/24 h during the course of the disease, a
greater need of dialysis for acute renal injury during follow-up, hematuria
>100,000/mL during the course of the disease, more cases of class IV and V LN,
and less frequent use of azathioprine and antimalarials.

Change in early renal function has been well established as a predictor of the
development of ESRD12,29,30. Other studies also related proteinuria to nephrotic levels throughout the
follow-up with the development of ESRD37,41,42. It is not uncommon for LN class IV to be considered the worst prognostic
factor for renal survival15,16,29, but pure class V LN is not cited as a prognostic factor for the development
of ESRD, as we observed. Many studies of renal survival have pointed to the
nephritic flare and lack of remission with treatment during follow-up as predictors
for development of ESRD13,29. In our study, we did not evaluate the criteria for nephritic flare as a
whole or any remission criteria due to the difficulty of defining such criteria with
only the available retrospective data. However, it is possible that detection of
hematuria levels >100,000/mL during follow-up as a predictor of renal prognosis
could correspond to the nephritic flares as prognostic factors in such cases.

Among the limitations of our study is the fact that it is a retrospective study. The
different treatments carried out were also not separated according to the induction
and maintenance phases, and comparisons between the most common classes were not
included, particularly between proliferative (III and IV) and pure membranous
classes.

In conclusion, the population of the present study was characterized by an expressive
renal impairment at LN presentation. Nevertheless, worsening of renal function
(defined as the doubling of serum creatinine) had a relatively low frequency
compared to other studies, possibly reflecting early diagnosis and treatment of the
predominant severe classes of LN. The main determinants of renal outcome were
baseline eGFR <75 mL/min and proteinuria >3.5 g/24h during follow-up.
Cumulative renal damage measured by SDI in the present study was associated with
such important markers of renal involvement, demonstrating that it might be a useful
tool to assess chronic injury and the need for preventing disease complications.
Thus, an earlier diagnosis and better management of LN, especially in cases with
high levels of proteinuria, may help to improve the prognosis of such disease.

Nefrite lúpica (NL) é uma das manifestações mais comuns e graves do lúpus
eritematoso sistêmico (LES), reconhecida como o maior preditor de mau
prognóstico. O objetivo deste estudo é analisar características
demográficas, correlações clinicopatológicas e fatores de risco associados a
desfechos renais no acompanhamento de longo prazo de pacientes com NL.

Estudo de coorte observacional retrospectivo de 112 pacientes com NL
comprovada por biópsia, acompanhados de julho/1985 a agosto/2015. Avaliamos
fatores de risco associados a comprometimento renal (dobrar o valor da
creatinina sérica), doença renal em estágio terminal (DRET, TFGe <15
mL/min) e dano renal cumulativo utilizando o Índice de Danos (ID) da
Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/ACR.

O tempo mediano de acompanhamento foi 8,3 anos. Houve predominância de NL
classe IV (64,3%), isoladamente ou em combinação e também um aumento
estatisticamente significativo no escore renal do ID entre 5 e 10 anos de
acompanhamento. Na análise multivariada, o ID final correlacionou-se com
TFGe inicial <75 mL/min (p < 0,001) e proteinúria >3,5 g/24 h ao
longo da doença (p < 0,001), superando parâmetros identificados na
análise univariada como uso de ciclofosfamida (p = 0,010) e não uso de
antimaláricos (p = 0,003); 13,4% dos pacientes evoluíram para
comprometimento da função renal e 11,6% para DRET.

O dano renal acumulado, avaliado pelo ID, foi um achado frequente. Os
principais determinantes do desfecho renal foram TFGe basal <75 mL/min e
proteinúria >3,5 g/24 h durante o acompanhamento. Assim, diagnóstico
precoce e melhor manejo da NL, especialmente em caso de altos níveis de
proteinúria, podem contribuir para melhora do prognóstico.

O lúpus eritematoso sistêmico (LES) é uma doença autoimune crônica e
multissistêmica do tecido conjuntivo1. O envolvimento renal no LES, a nefrite lúpica (NL), é frequente e
constitui também uma das manifestações mais graves de LES. Afeta até 60% dos
adultos com a doença; a incidência depende da população estudada, sendo maior em
asiáticos, afrodescendentes e hispânicos2−4. A NL é reconhecida como o principal preditor de mau prognóstico, uma vez
que está associada a um aumento significativo da mortalidade2,4−6. Há cerca de 50 anos, a sobrevida mediana em cinco anos de pacientes com
NL era de 44%; melhorou drasticamente para aproximada-mente 82% na década de
1990. Essa redução na mortalidade deve-se ao melhor conhecimento da doença, o
que leva a um diagnóstico mais precoce, e a um manejo terapêutico mais eficaz e agressivo2,4,7.

Apesar de melhorar o curso da doença, o tratamento pode ser prolongado,
potencialmente tóxico e difícil de planejar e manter8,9. Tanto o tratamento quanto a atividade da doença ao longo do tempo podem
causar danos permanentes a diferentes órgãos, levando à disfunção, como a doença
renal crônica (DRC) no caso da NL. Para alguns autores9,10, a identificação de preditores de danos cumulativos é de grande
importância para melhorar os desfechos do LES. Nesse contexto, o Índice de Danos
(ID) daSystemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/ACRé um instrumento validado para medir o dano irreversível em pacientes com LES9. De fato, a sobrevida em curto prazo de pacientes com LES melhorou, mas
danos irreversíveis aos órgãos se acumulam durante o curso da doença,
contribuindo para o comprometimento da qualidade de vida e o aumento da
mortalidade em longo prazo. Assim, o manejo do paciente deve ter como objetivo
não apenas aumentar a sobrevida, mas também reduzir a morbidade causada pela
doença e sua terapia10. Isso pode ser, em parte, avaliado por índices como o ID, que podem
fornecer informações adicionais no acompanhamento de pacientes com NL.

A incidência média de doença renal em estágio terminal (DRET) em 10 anos de
acompanhamento é de 15% e pode chegar a 25−30% em 15 anos11,12,13,14,15. A ausência de remissão da NL com o tratamento é provavelmente um dos
mais importantes preditores de progressão para DRC. Outros fatores de risco para
o comprometimento renal também foram estabelecidos e incluem sexo masculino,
baixo nível socioeconômico, etnia (ser afrodescendente ou hispânico), presença
de crescentes em mais de 50% dos glomérulos na biópsia renal, classes
proliferativas (III e IV) e tratamento com corti-coides isoladadamente, não
utilização de antimaláricos, creatinina sérica inicial elevada, proteinúria
nefrótica, hipertensão arterial sistêmica, anemia e consumo de complemento16,17,18,19. Tais características tendem a variar de acordo com cada estudo, uma vez
que há diferenças nas definições dos desfechos, nas populações e na duração do
acompanhamento, dificultando a extrapolação dos achados.

Estudos anteriores sobre desfechos em pacientes brasileiros com NL demonstraram
que a proteinúria inicial e os níveis de creatinina sérica, assim como a
resposta inicial ao tratamento e a cronicidade na biópsia renal, estiveram
relacionados a piores desfechos20,21,22. Analisamos as características demográficas, as correlações
clinicopatológicas e os fatores de risco associados aos desfechos renais em um
acompanhamento de longo prazo, incluindo perda da função renal, DRET e danos
cumulativos em uma coorte longitudinal de pacientes com NL comprovada por
biópsia.

Foram analisados dados retrospectivos de prontuários médicos de pacientes com
diagnóstico de LES - de acordo com os critérios revisados doAmerican
College of Rheumatology(ACR) - e diagnóstico histopatológico de
NL, acompanhados na Disciplina de Nefrologia (Seção de Glomerulopatias) da
Universidade Federal de São Paulo (UNIFESP), um centro de referência terciário e
acadêmico em São Paulo, Brasil. Os pacientes incluídos foram acompanhados de
julho de 1985 a agosto de 2015. A NL foi classificada de acordo com as
classificações da Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS) e daInternational
Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society(ISN/RPS)23. Foram incluídos pacientes de ambos os sexos, com idade igual ou superior
a 12 anos e com um tempo de acompanhamento igual ou superior a um ano.

As seguintes variáveis foram avaliadas: idade no início do acompanhamento, sexo,
pressão arterial, creatinina sérica, proteinúria, hematúria, anticorpos
antinucleares e anti-DNA de dupla hélice, consumo de complemento, manifestações
laboratoriais e clínicas do LES, taxa de filtração glomerular estimada (TFGe)
determinada por meio da fórmulaChronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology
Collaboration(CKD-EPI)24e laudos de biópsia. O tipo e a duração do tratamento, bem como o período
de início das infecções, também foram registrados.

O comprometimento renal foi definido como alcançar pelo menos a duplicação do
valor da creatinina sérica e a DRET como TFGe <15 mL/min (DRC estágio 5) ou
necessidade de terapia renal substitutiva. Também avaliamos o dano renal
utilizando o ID9. Esse instrumento já foi validado e aplicado em diversas populações e
etnias. Ele avalia os danos não reversíveis, relacionados ao LES e seu
tratamento, em 12 órgãos ou sistemas9,10,25. O dano no sistema renal, de acordo com o ID, foi definido como um dos
seguintes: 1) TFG estimada <50 mL/min (escore: 1); 2) proteinúria persistente
na faixa nefrótica ≥ 3,5 g/24 h (escore: 1); e DRET (escore: 3). Todos os
pacientes tiveram o ID avaliado em 1 ano e ao final do acompanhamento; 34
pacientes que foram acompanhados por um período mais longo também tiveram o ID
avaliado em 5 e 10 anos.

As análises estatísticas foram inicialmente realizadas de forma descritiva
(médias, medianas, porcentagens). Em seguida, testes inferenciais foram
aplicados quando necessário e citados na seção Resultados. Valores de p
inferiores a 0,05 foram considerados estatisticamente significativos. As
análises foram realizadas com o software R, versão 3.0.2. (R Core
Team, 2016).

Foram incluídos 112 pacientes, com um tempo mediano de acompanhamento de 99,9
meses (intervalo de 12 a 322). A idade média foi de 31 ± 10,8 anos, 83,9% eram
do sexo feminino e 54,8% eram brancos. As características basais são
apresentadas naTabela 1.

As manifestações clínicas predominantes do LES associadas à NL foram as
hematológicas (80,4%), com destaque para anemia (74,1%), seguidas por consumo de
complemento (68,8%) e acometimento articular (67%). A hematúria
>100.000/mm3na apresentação da doença renal ocorreu em 52
pacientes (53,1% dos pacientes com hematúria) e, ao final do acompanhamento, em
seis pacientes (11,1% daqueles com hematúria nesse estágio). Na apresentação, o
perfil laboratorial revelou creatinina sérica elevada (média de 1,62 mg/dL) e
proteinúria >3,5 g/24 h em 49% dos pacientes e, em algum momento do curso da
doença, em 72% dos pacientes.

A distribuição das classes histológicas da NL ocorreu da seguinte forma: 3,57%
classe II, 7,14% classe III, 64,29% classe IV, 23,21% classe V e 1,79% classe
VI. Uma combinação de classes ocorreu em 11 pacientes, todos com classe IV, e 8
deles eram classe IV+V. Para simplificar a análise, esses últimos foram todos
categorizados como classe IV.

A hipertensão arterial foi diagnosticada em 76,8% dos pacientes, exigindo apenas
um ou dois medicamentos anti-hipertensivos para controle na maioria dos casos.
Todos os pacientes haviam recebido corticosteroides durante o acompanhamento;
53,6% dos pacientes receberam ciclofosfamida intravenosa, 19,6% ciclofosfamida
oral, 47,3% azatioprina, 41,1% micofenolato (mofetil ou sódico) e 62,5%
antimaláricos (cloroquina ou hidroxicloroquina). O tratamento com azatioprina
foi mais comum em pacientes com NL classe II (p = 0,047). Na classe IV, os
tratamentos mais utilizados foram a ciclofosfamida intravenosa (p < 0,001) e
o micofenolato (p = 0,003). Esses tratamentos foram menos utilizados entre os
pacientes da classe V (p = 0,006 e p = 0,011, respectivamente). Infecções do
trato respiratório superior foram associadas ao uso de ciclofosfamida oral (p =
0,034).

Em comparação com as demais classes de NL, a classe IV (Tabela 2) esteve associada a uma pior função renal no início
do estudo, maior creatinina sérica inicial (p < 0,001) e menor TFGe inicial
(p < 0,001), bem como à detecção mais frequente de critérios de atividade
renal, como hematúria >100.000/mL inicial e durante o acompanhamento (p <
0,001), atividade imunológica com maior frequência de positividade para anti-DNA
(p < 0,001) e detecção mais frequente de hipertensão arterial (p = 0,028). A
classe IV também apresentou maior incidência de DRET no final do acompanhamento
quando comparada com as outras classes (p = 0,003).

Entre os pacientes com NL classe V, a creatinina sérica inicial foi menor (p =
0,002), a TFGe inicial foi maior (p = 0,003), os níveis iniciais (p < 0,001)
e de acompanhamento de hematúria (p < 0,001) foram menores e houve
positividade para anti-DNA menos frequentemente (p < 0,001); a TFGe final
> 15 mL/min foi mais frequente (p = 0,003).

Durante o acompanhamento, 15 (13,4%) pacientes apresentaram comprometimento da
função renal (duplicação da creatinina sérica). O perfil dos pacientes que
apresentaram piora da função renal até o último ano de acompanhamento não
demonstrou diferença estatisticamente significativa nas análises estatísticas
univariadas quando comparado aos que não apresentaram piora.

Treze pacientes (11,6%) evoluíram para DRET. Na análise univariada, os pacientes
que desenvolveram DRET apresentaram creatinina sérica basal mais elevada (p <
0,001) e creatinina sérica superior a 1,2 mg/dL (p = 0,001) na apresentação;
também foram mais frequentemente submetidos à diálise por injúria renal aguda no
acompanhamento (p = 0,033), apresentaram mais proteinúria >3,5 g/24 h durante
o curso da doença (p = 0,010), mais hematúria acima de 100.000/mL (p = 0,032) e
eram mais frequentemente das classes IV (p = 0,003) e V (p = 0,033).

Cinquenta e um (45,5%) pacientes apresentaram um escore de pelo menos 1 para dano
renal no ID. Desses 51 pacientes que apresentaram lesão renal, 29 (56,8%)
pontuaram por apresentarem TFGe <50 mL/min, 19 (37,2%) por manterem
proteinúria ≥ 3,5 g/24h e 13 (25,4%) por DRET. Trinta e quatro pacientes foram
acompanhados por um período mais longo e gerando informações para avaliação do
dano renal por meio do ID em 5 e 10 anos, e 4 (11,8%) apresentaram um aumento no
escore ao longo do tempo. Na comparação inferencial dos escores do ID entre 5 e
10 anos, foi encontrado um aumento estatisticamente significativo nesses escores
(p = 0,046).

O escore final de dano renal do ID também foi correlacionado com o perfil dos
pacientes para identificar fatores de risco associados (Tabela 3). Os resultados inferenciais univariados revelaram
que pacientes com creatinina sérica basal >1,2 mg/dL (p < 0,001), com TFGe
basal <75 mL/min (p < 0,001), submetidos à diálise por injúria renal aguda
(p = 0,002), com proteinúria >3.5 g/24 h durante o curso da doença (p =
0,013), com NL classe IV (p = 0,010), que fizeram uso de ciclofosfamida
intravenosa (p = 0,010) e que não utilizaram antimaláricos (p = 0,003)
apresentaram os escores mais elevados de dano renal pelo ID. O escore final do
ID correlacionou-se com os níveis iniciais de creatinina sérica (coeficiente de
correlação de Spearman, s = 0,406; p < 0,001). A análise multivariada
demonstrou que os fatores que foram independentemente correlacionados com o ID
final foram TFGe<75 mL/min na apresentação (p < 0,001) e proteinúria
>3,5 g/24 h durante o curso da doença (p < 0,001).

O desenvolvimento de DRC e DRET na NL é uma preocupação relevante no
acompanhamento desses pacientes. Em 1997, dados doMedicarenos
Estados Unidos indicaram que a NL foi o principal diagnóstico em 2% dos
pacientes em diálise e em 5% dos pacientes submetidos a transplante renal26. O risco de DRC em pacientes com LES tem diminuído nas últimas décadas,
coincidindo com a evolução do tratamento, um maior conhecimento da doença e o
diagnóstico mais precoce. De 1970 a meados da década de 1990, o risco absoluto
de DRC reduziu em cerca de 10%27. Houve também uma queda na incidência de DRET em pacientes com NL ao
longo do tempo, de aproximadamente 16% nas décadas de 1970 e 1980 para 11% nas
décadas de 1990 e 2000; porém, há indícios de que essa incidência tenha atingido
umplateaudesde então24.

Alguns estudos anteriores se concentraram em identificar fatores de risco
relacionados ao compro-metimento da função renal e à DRET, e os resultados
tendem a variar consideravelmente12,13,14,15,16,27,29,30,31. Nosso estudo avaliou as características demográficas, correlações
clinicopatológicas e fatores de risco associados a desfechos renais em uma
coorte de pacientes brasileiros com NL, que foram acompanhados por um período
mediano de 8,3 anos. A creatinina sérica inicial média de nossa população foi de
1,62 mg/dL, o que demonstra que um número considerável de nossos pacientes
iniciou o acompanhamento com função renal prejudicada. Estudos anteriores em
pacientes com LES consideraram que a creatinina sérica estava alterada no início
do estudo quando seu valor era igual ou superior a 1,2 mg/dL, e isso ocorreu em
32 a 39,3% dos casos, em média27,28. Em nossa amostra, 50% dos pacientes apresentaram creatinina sérica
inicial ≥1,2 mg/dL. Da mesma forma, quase metade dos pacientes (49,1%)
apresentou proteinúria >3,5 g/24 h no início e a grande maioria dos pacientes
(72,3%) apresentou proteinúria >3,5 g/24 h pelo menos uma vez durante o
acompanhamento. Sem dúvida, todos esses aspectos demonstram a gravidade da
apresentação da NL na população que avaliamos. É importante lembrar que a
Disciplina de Nefrologia (Seção de Glomerulopatias) da UNIFESP faz parte de um
grande hospital terciário e recebe pacientes de todo o país, muitas vezes
encaminhados devido a quadros graves e complexos, o que pode explicar em parte o
tipo de apresentação relatado, além da maior gravidade da doença.

No entanto, encontramos uma frequência relativamente baixa de DRC progressiva em
nossa população, consistente com estudos anteriores. Até o último ano de
acompanhamento, a creatinina sérica basal duplicou em 13,4% dos pacientes. Além
disso, o perfil dos pacientes que apresentaram piora da função renal não
demonstrou diferença significativa em relação aos que não apresentaram piora.
Estudos anteriores relatam uma incidência de DRC amplamente variável de 8,9 a 44%8,13,25,27,29,32,33.

Ao analisar o escore de dano renal do ID, 45,5% dos pacientes apresentaram um
escore de pelo menos 1. Esse índice foi muito maior do que o encontrado ao
estudar uma população com LES de modo geral, e não especificamente com NL, como
fizemos. Em estudos prévios com LES, o envolvimento renal ocorreu em 11 a 23,3%
dos pacientes24,34. Nossos dados mostram que creatinina sérica basal > 1,2 mg/dL, TFGe
basal <75 mL/min, diálise devido à injúria renal aguda durante o
acompanhamento, proteinúria >3,5 g/24 h durante o curso da doença, NL classe
IV, uso de ciclofosfamida intravenosa e não uso de antimaláricos foram fatores
de risco para dano renal no ID na análise univariada. Entretanto, a análise
multivariada demonstrou que apenas a TFGe <75 mL/min no início e a
proteinúria >3,5 g/24h ao longo do curso da doença permaneceram como fatores
de risco independentes. O escore final do ID correlacionou-se com os níveis
iniciais de creatinina sérica.

Já existem evidências suficientes de que o dano medido pelo ID é um preditor de
sobrevida, bem como de danos futuros25,35,36, e que o domínio do dano renal tem maior relação com a diminuição da
sobrevida do que outros domínios25,36. Tanto o déficit inicial da função renal quanto a proteinúria têm sido
apontados inúmeras vezes como preditores de pior desfecho renal, como confirmado
no presente estudo. Estudos com grandes coortes31,32concluíram que a redução da proteinúria é o fator que exerce a maior
influência no prognóstico renal. Ensaios menores identificaram níveis nefróticos
de proteinúria durante o curso da doença como um fator independente para definir
o prognóstico renal15,37. A grande maioria dos estudos demonstrou que a creatinina sérica inicial
ou a presença de déficit inicial da função renal são fatores de risco de
progressão para DRET12,13,16,29,30. Dessa forma, existe um consenso de que as classes proliferativas merecem
um tratamento mais agressivo quando há creatinina sérica elevada e/ou
proteinúria nefrótica13.

Outros fatores de risco considerados preditores de sobrevida renal, como sexo e
classes histológicas de NL, não foram associados à piora da função renal em
nosso estudo. De fato, mesmo a NL classe IV não permaneceu como preditor de pior
prognóstico na análise multivariada em nossa amostra. Embora as classes
proliferativas sejam frequentemente citadas como um fator de risco, existem
alguns estudos importantes que não encontraram tal associação8,27. É possível que, nos últimos anos, a identificação precoce e a
instituição de tratamento imunossupressor intensivo adotadas nesses casos tenham
alterado o papel dessa variável no curso atual da NL. É importante ressaltar que
o uso de antimaláricos também ganharam apoio mais recentemente, com evidências
que sugerem a associação com uma menor taxa de lesão renal e uma taxa reduzida
de DRET18,19. No entanto, encontramos essa associação somente na análise
univariada.

O desenvolvimento da DRET, definida como TFGe <15 mL/min, independentemente da
necessidade de diálise ou transplante renal, ocorreu em 11,6% dos pacientes. Os
dados sobre a incidência de DRET variam consideravelmente, assim como as
características das populações estudadas, o que dificulta a comparação entre
essas populações. De modo geral, os relatos sobre o desenvolvimento da DRET em
pacientes com NL variam de 8 a 30%12,25,27,28,38,39,40. Os pacientes de nossa amostra que evoluíram para DRET apresentaram
creatinina sérica inicial significativamente mais elevada, bem como níveis mais
frequentes de creatinina sérica >1,2 mg/dL, proteinúria >3,5 g/24 h
durante o curso da doença, maior necessidade de diálise por injúria renal aguda
durante o acompanhamento, hematúria >100.000/mL durante o curso da doença,
mais casos de NL classes IV e V e uso menos frequente de azatioprina e
antimaláricos.

A alteração na função renal inicial foi bem estabelecida como um preditor do
desenvolvimento de DRET12,29,30. Outros estudos também relacionaram proteinúria em níveis nefróticos ao
longo do acompanhamento com o desenvolvimento de DRET37,41,42. Não é incomum que a NL classe IV seja considerada o pior fator
prognóstico para a sobrevida renal15,16,29. No entanto, a NL classe V pura não é citada como um fator prognóstico
para o desenvolvimento de DRET, tal como observamos. Muitos estudos de sobrevida
renal apontaram a crise nefrítica e a ausência de remissão com o tratamento
durante o acompanhamento como preditores para o desenvolvimento de DRET13,29. Em nosso estudo, não avaliamos os critérios de crise nefrítica como um
todo, nem quaisquer critérios de remissão, devido à dificuldade de defini-los
apenas com os dados retrospectivos disponíveis. No entanto, é possível que a
detecção de níveis de hematúria >100.000/mL durante o acompanhamento como um
preditor de prognóstico renal possa corresponder às crises nefríticas como
fatores prognósticos nesses casos.

Dentre as limitações do nosso estudo está o fato de que se trata de um estudo
retrospectivo. Os diferentes tratamentos realizados também não foram separados
de acordo com as fases de indução e manutenção, e não foram incluídas
comparações entre as classes mais comuns, particularmente entre as classes
proliferativas (III e IV) e a classe membranosa pura.

Em conclusão, a população do presente estudo foi caracterizada por um
comprometimento renal expressivo na apresentação da NL. No entanto, a piora da
função renal (definida como dobrar o valor da creatinina sérica) apresentou uma
frequência relativamente baixa em comparação com outros estudos, possivelmente
refletindo o diagnóstico precoce e o tratamento das classes graves predominantes
de NL. Os principais determinantes do desfecho renal foram TFGe basal <75
mL/min e proteinúria >3,5 g/24h durante o acompanhamento. O dano renal
cumulativo medido pelo ID no presente estudo foi associado a esses importantes
marcadores de envolvimento renal, demonstrando que pode ser uma ferramenta útil
para avaliar a injúria crônica e a necessidade de prevenir complicações da
doença. Assim, um diagnóstico mais precoce e um melhor manejo da NL,
especialmente em casos com níveis elevados de proteinúria, podem ajudar a
melhorar o prognóstico dessa doença.

Serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBF‐SEM) enables automated 3D imaging of specimens with ultrastructural resolution. However, its application is often restricted due to the complex and labor‐intensive nature of the processes involved. This study addresses the challenges associated with sample preparation and the final 3D reconstruction for ultrastructural analysis of peripheral nerves and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) specimens.

Specimens from the caudal nerve and DRG of mice were prepared for SBF‐SEM using three different techniques: (1) manual high molecular weight staining, regarded as the gold standard, (2) automated standard transmission electron microscopy (TEM) preparation, and (3) automated uranyl‐free en bloc preparation. The acquired data were processed by combining different software programs for image analysis and 3D rendering.

Upon analyzing all samples, the high molecular weight method demonstrated its superiority. Nonetheless, the two alternative methods produced high‐quality images of the caudal nerve. Consequently, 3D rendering was successfully achieved for all samples using an automated approach. The investigation of DRG specimens posed greater challenges with the standard TEM preparation due to the low contrast of smaller organelles compared to the cytosol, whereas the uranyl‐free protocol provided significantly improved contrast.

Our findings indicate that automated uranyl‐free staining can effectively compete with the traditional gold standard manual and uranyl‐based staining methods, albeit with some limitations. Furthermore, high‐quality SBF‐SEM imaging is attainable, especially in peripheral nerves, using samples prepared via the standard TEM method, thereby facilitating the analysis of previously embedded samples even if they were not specifically prepared for 3D examination.

Recent advancements in imaging technologies have enabled the visualization of biological samples with unmatched precision. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has been a key tool in peripheral nervous system (PNS) research and diagnostics, allowing detailed descriptions of cell structure and organization due to its high resolution (down to a few nanometers) and high‐magnification images. While TEM can be used to reconstruct three‐dimensional structures by stacking ultrathin serial sections, the 2D nature of individual sections limits its ability to provide true volumetric information. Although 3D reconstructions from TEM data are possible, they require extensive manual alignment, making the process complex, time‐consuming, and less suitable for large‐scale sample analysis [1,2,3].

In this context, serial block face‐scanning electron microscopy (SBF‐SEM) offers an automated method for 3D specimen acquisition with ultrastructural resolution [4,5]. This technique combines low‐voltage backscattered electron detection from layers beneath the sample surface with iterative slicing using an in‐chamber ultramicrotome, which cuts the sample in the z‐direction. As a result, 3D imaging provides a deeper and more accurate understanding of biological structures.

While SBF‐SEM has proven effective in central nervous system research, its use in the PNS remains limited. This is primarily due to the technique's labor‐intensive nature. Although SBF‐SEM enables faster volume imaging compared to other TEM‐based electron microscopy methods [6], sample preparation and data analysis pose significant challenges. En bloc staining, dehydration, and resin embedding require specific protocols that are largely manual, limiting throughput to a small number of specimens. Additionally, processing large data sets is computationally demanding and requires specialized user training [7].

Furthermore, since the staining and embedding methods used for SBF‐SEM are quite different from those for standard TEM preparation, the possibility of reusing PNS samples prepared for TEM in SBF‐SEM imaging has not been explored and remains uncertain.

Lastly, SBF‐SEM often employs uranyl acetate as a negative stain, which is radioactive and toxic, raising concerns about safety and environmental impact.

In this study, we tackle the challenges of sample preparation and 3D reconstruction by developing semi‐automated workflows for batch processing and volume rendering. We also investigate the feasibility of uranyl acetate‐free en bloc staining for ultrastructural analysis of peripheral nerves and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) specimens and the viability of using TEM‐prepared samples for SBF‐SEM imaging.

Specimens from the caudal nerve and DRG of mice were prepared for SBF‐SEM using three different techniques: (1) manual high molecular weight staining, regarded as the gold standard, (2) automated standard transmission electron microscopy (TEM) preparation, and (3) automated uranyl‐free en bloc preparation. The acquired data were processed by combining different software programs for image analysis and 3D rendering.

In compliance with the 3R's principles aimed at the reduction of animal use for experimental studies [8], healthy Balb/c mice (Envigo, San Pietro al Natisone, Italy) belonging as controls to a study conducted in conformity with the institutional guidelines in compliance with national (D. L.vo 26/2014, Gazzetta Ufficiale della Repubblica Italiana, n.61, March 14, 2014) and international laws and policies (European Union directive 2010/63/UE; Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, U.S. National Research Council, 1996), and approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (approval n. 777/2022‐PR) were used. Intracardiac perfusion was performed in animals under deep anesthesia with Ketamine/Xylazine using a peristaltic pump (Heidolph Pumpdrive 5101, Biosigma, Cona, Venice, Italy). An 18‐gauge needle was inserted into the left ventricle at an angle approximately parallel to the midline of the heart; then a small incision was made in the right atrium. Immediately after the venous blood escaped from the right atrium (approx. 7 mL), perfusion with sterile saline solution was started at a constant speed of approximately 1 mL/5 s to clean the vascular tree. The animals were then perfused with 150 mL 4% paraformaldehyde at the same constant rate. Subsequently, caudal nerves and DRG were dissected out and immediately immersed in 3% glutaraldehyde diluted in 0.15 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 3 h for a further fixation. Nerves were cut into small pieces (approx. 5 mm) with a razor blade to help the samples fit inside the baskets of the automatic staining instrument and the staining solutions penetrate homogeneously within the tissue volume. DRG tissues were prepared without trimming their initial volume.

The first set of samples was manually prepared and contrasted following the procedure described by Deerinck T.J. et al. [9] and adapted to our needs with modifications. Therefore, the fixative solution was replaced with 0.15 M sodium cacodylate buffer with three sequential 15 min washes. Samples were post‐fixed for 2 h in 2% osmium tetroxide/1.5% potassium ferricyanide K3[Fe(Cn)6], at room temperature with constant agitation. Thereafter, tissues were washed first in 0.15 M sodium cacodylate buffer and then with deionized water before leaving them in freshly filtered 1% thiocarbohydrazide aqueous solution for 40 min at 60°C. Specimens were further washed in water and impregnated with 1% osmium tetroxide in aqueous solution for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were subjected to additional contrast enhancement steps by soaking them overnight in a filtered solution of 1% uranyl acetate at 4°C, followed by Waltson's lead aspartate staining at 60°C for 30 min. Three 15‐min washes in water were performed and then followed by dehydration through graded ethanol balanced in deionized water (50%, 70%, 96%, two steps in 100%, 15 min each step), at room temperature. Two 10 min incubations in 100% propylene oxide were performed to ensure the total sample dehydration and were followed by embedding in epoxy resin at the hard formulation (13.75 mL of EMbed 812, 4.65 mL of Dodecenyl Succinic Anhydride (DDSA), 8.25 mL of Methyl‐5‐Norbornene‐2,3‐Dicarboxylic Anhydride (NMA), 533 μL of 2,4,6‐Tris(dimethylaminomethyl)phenol (DMP‐30)). Samples were placed into 50% propylene oxide/50% hard epoxy resin for 2 h and left overnight at room temperature with the open lid in a fume hood. The day after, the resin mixture was replaced with fresh and pure epoxy resin in hard formulation, devoid of any bubbles, for 2 h before transferring each sample into molds for the final resin polymerization at 60°C for 48 h, to create a block of uniform hardness.

The second set of samples was processed with the Leica EM TP 1020 Automated Tissue Processor (Leica Biosystems, Buccinasco, Italy). All the samples were separately inserted into porous baskets, and reagent solutions were prepared and neatly placed for successive sample immersions. Solution penetration was helped by the gentle swirling of the baskets inside each reagent tank. The processing schedule was inspired by Palade G. et al. protocol [10] with modifications. After fixation, the fixative solution was replaced with phosphate buffer solution two times and, again, with 0.12 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) two times for 10 min each. Then, samples were impregnated with 1.5% osmium tetroxide diluted in the aforementioned buffer for 2 h and 30 min at room temperature. Specimens were consecutively washed in 0.12 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 10 min each prior to the gradual ethanol dehydration (50%, 70%, 96%, two steps in 100%, 10 min each step) at room temperature. Two incubations in 100% propylene oxide were performed for 10 min, followed by 66%, 33%, and 0% propylene oxide mixture balanced with epoxy resin for the gradual resin embedding (30 min each step) at room temperature. Resin was prepared by blending equal volumes of mixture A (9.4 g DDSA and 8.82 g EPON 812) and mixture B (8.14 g NMA and 12.5 g EPON 812), with 1.5%–2% of embedding medium accelerator (DMP‐30). Resin‐embedded specimens were finally transferred into molds, and the resin polymerized at 60°C for 48 h.

The third set of samples was processed with the Leica EM TP 1020 Automated Tissue Processor (Leica Biosystems, Buccinasco, Italy). The processing schedule was inspired by Moscardini et al.'s published protocol [11] with modifications. The so‐called X‐solution (a lanthanide and phosphotungstic acid mixture) was produced in our laboratory following the description from the article. After specimen fixation was performed, samples were separately inserted into porous baskets with phosphate buffer and incubated for two times 10 min each. Successively, 0.12 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) was used to wash the samples for two times (10 min each) prior to post‐fixation in 1% potassium ferricyanide K3[Fe(Cn)6]‐reduced 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h and 45 min at room temperature. Specimens were then washed twice in 0.12 M sodium cacodylate buffer and again in bidistilled water (each step for 10 min). Samples were then conditioned in 20% ethanol for 10 min before being impregnated with X‐solution for 1 h at room temperature. Gradual ethanol dehydration (20%, 50%, 70%, 96%, two steps in 100%, 10 min each step) was then performed at room temperature. Samples were subsequently impregnated in 100% propylene oxide for 10 min and gradually embedded in epoxy resin with propylene oxide and resin balanced mixture (75%, 50%, 25%, and 0%, respectively) for 30 min each step, at room temperature. The used resin had a hard formulation. Resin‐embedded specimens were finally transferred into molds, and the resin polymerized at 60°C for 48 h.

Semi‐thin (1–1.5 μm) sections from the block face were collected, stained with toluidine blue, and examined under a conventional bright field optical microscope for structural integrity check and selection of the region of interest (ROI); ultrathin (approx. 70 nm) sections were checked using a Hitachi TEM HT7800 (Hitachi High‐Tech Europe GmbH, Krefeld, Germany) before proceeding to sample mounting and SBF‐SEM imaging, to ensure the quality of the staining. The block face was, hereafter, trimmed with a razor blade to create a truncated square pyramid (approx. 500 μm × 500 μm × 2 mm) with the ROI near its center and to remove the empty resin which increases the build‐up of negative charges on the surface during the imaging. The pyramid was then dislodged and mounted onto an aluminum pin using a drop of pre‐cured embedding resin as glue. The resin drop was left polymerizing overnight in the oven at 60°C to ensure sample‐pin anchoring. The specimen surface was again smoothed with the diamond knife, to produce a flat block face and reduce any possible small tilts with the diamond knife of the in‐chamber ultramicrotome. Finally, mounted samples were sputter‐coated with a fine nm‐layer of gold palladium using a Vac Coat DSCT sputter coater device (Vac Coat Ltd., London, UK) and the aluminum pin base and block edges were covered with a small amount of silver paste before the insertion into the SBF‐chamber.

Cubic microns of imaging data were achieved with a Zeiss GeminiSEM 360 (Carl Zeiss S.p.A., Milan, Italy) equipped with the in‐chamber ultramicrotome Volutome, and piloted by the Volutome software package, which fully assists the slicing and imaging cycle with minimal user involvement. Sectioning was fixed to the nominal speed of 0.1 mm/s and thickness of 50 nm for every cycle, thus determining the axial resolution as well as the voxel size. In parallel, high‐resolution acquisitions of resin block faces were performed using a 30 μm beam aperture and the Volutome backscattered electrons (BSD) detector, which allows image acquisition with hundreds‐μm field‐of‐view. In particular, for DRG acquisition, the pixel size was always chosen above 10 k per side for a larger sample surface vision. Optimum imaging conditions were adjusted depending on the sample level of contrast, conductivity, and possible sample damage due to negative charging. Nitrogen gas injection through the focal charge compensation (FCC) system was systematically used to mitigate charging and improve cutting performance.

Acquired data were processed by combining different software programs. If needed, image stack alignment was performed using the Zen Blue software (Carl Zeiss S.p.A., Milan, Italy); segmentation, deep learning models, final 3D rendering, and downstream analysis of tissue ultrastructure were, instead, accomplished via Zen Arivis Vision4D (Carl Zeiss S.p.A., Milan, Italy). The fully automated approach was chosen to post‐process different sample acquisitions. Therefore, for each tissue compartment (i.e., myelin sheaths, axons, mitochondria, cell nucleus, …), deep learning (DL) models were devised by manually tracing the structures of interest with the brush tool; generally, up to 50 annotations were needed for data segmentation. Regardless of the used staining strategy, the single biological compartment was identified and reconstructed with the same model. DL segmenters were then combined with an additional feature filter to remove erroneously labeled objects prior to the 3D reconstruction.

Differences in contrast between cell organelles and surrounding cytoplasm were evaluated using Fiji software (Open‐source ImageJ distribution. Available atwww.imagej.net). Pixel gray values along a line (1‐pixel width and approx. 0.5–0.7 μm length) of three elements from five different SEM frames (n= 15) crossing an organelle and adjacent cytoplasm region were plotted with Graph Pad software v.10.0.2 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). Maximum values correspond to less contrasted regions, such as the cytosol; on the contrary, minimum values correspond to higher heavy metal deposition, as in the case of lipidic membranes.

The en bloc staining method described by Deerink et al. [9], used in preparing the first set of samples, has been reported to provide exceptional structural detail in biological specimens [12]. As a result, we considered it the gold standard for our SBF‐SEM imaging. Figure1Aipresents a micrograph of the caudal nerve's inner architecture, prepared using this high molecular weight staining technique with slight modifications. The heavy metal deposition enhanced the resolution of cellular ultrastructure, intra‐axonal mitochondria, and even individual collagen filaments, achieving a minimum x, y pixel size of 4–5 nm. Figure1Aiiprovides a magnified view of a Schwann cell segment, clearly showing the double‐layered nuclear membrane, vesicles, and intracellular organelles. A plot of pixel intensity variations along a cross‐sectional line demonstrates distinct intensity differences, where cytosolic regions exhibit the highest values and organelle bodies the lowest. The conductivity achieved through this sample preparation enabled long‐duration imaging with low‐voltage stimulation (2.5 keV) while minimizing charge accumulation, which was controlled using FCC at a medium power level (~60%). Figure1Aiiishows a myelinated axon and the adjacent Schwann cell, demonstrating optimal visualization of intracellular organelles and membranes.



Caudal nerve. Distinctive biological structures are highlighted: Myelinated fibers (MF), unmyelinated fibers (uMF), intra axonal mitochondrion (m), collagen bundles (c), and Schwann's cells (Sch). (A) high molecular weight staining: (i) micrograph from dataset acquired in BSD mode with 3 kV as accelerating voltage, 5 nm as x, y resolution, 1.6 μs as dwell time, 60% FCC and resulting electron dose approx. 94 e/nm2.

(C) Uranyl‐free en bloc staining: (i) micrograph of a caudal nerve (BSD mode, 1.75 kV, 6 nm pixel size, 1 μs as dwell time, 65% FCC, approx. 40 e/nm2). Scale bar 2 μm. (ii) Magnified view of a Schwann cell and intra‐axonal mitochondria (scale bar 1 μm) with the plot of their grey profiles (red line for intra‐axonal mitochondrion, green line for SC's mitochondrion). (iii) Magnified view of myelinated axon and nearby Schwann cell (scale bar 500 nm), with the 3D reconstruction of myelin (in blue), Schwann cell (in yellow) and mitochondria (in magenta) (volume size of 24 × 24 × 20 μm, scale bar 1 μm).

In addition to manual heavy metal staining, we explored the use of automated sample preparation methods in the second set of samples.

First, we adapted the Palade et al. [10] protocol to suit our needs. While these samples exhibited only moderate heavy metal impregnation, various tissue structures remained clearly distinguishable under low magnification, as illustrated in Figure1Bi. Myelin sheaths displayed the strongest contrast with a uniform intensity. Similarly, mitochondria within axons were easily identifiable due to their distinct contrast relative to surrounding structures, while Schwann cell nuclei, unmyelinated axons, and endoneural collagen bundles were visible with a fixed x, y pixel size of 6 nm—our lowest achievable lateral resolution using this staining method. At higher magnifications, intracellular structures in Schwann cells were generally stained, though individual organelles remained difficult to resolve due to the limited contrast. As shown in magnified Figure1Bii, the contrast difference between the cytosol and organelles was minimal (green line), whereas mitochondria within axons exhibited a stronger distinction (red line). Imaging with an accelerating voltage below 4 keV provided little enhancement in structural detection, so the electron dose (approx. 84 e/nm2) was minimized using FCC at maximum power.

For the third set of samples, we employed an uranyl acetate‐free staining method. This staining approach, known as X‐solution, was developed by Moscardini et al. [11] and consists of a lanthanide and phosphotungstic acid mixture, which enhances electron beam scattering. Myelin, axonal mitochondria, and Schwann cells, as well as nuclei from other cells within the nerve, were identifiable at a maximum resolution of 5–6 nm (Figure1Ciand with higher magnification and intensity profiles in Figure1Cii), even at a reduced electron beam stimulation of 1.75 keV. However, other intracellular structures exhibited lower contrast, making them harder to differentiate from the cytosol, as seen in Figure1Cii.

We trained separate DL models in the Arivis Vision4D Pro environment to segment myelin, Schwann cells, and mitochondria across all three staining methods (3D renderings shown in Figure1Aiii,Biii,Ciii; see also VideoS1). Myelin structures, which strongly retain osmium, were efficiently segmented due to their relatively consistent shape across sections (VideoS2). While Schwann cells displayed variable wrapping morphologies along myelin and shared contrast similarities with collagen bundles, their segmentation remained accurate thanks to well‐defined membrane boundaries. Mitochondria segmentation was highly effective when they were within axons, where the contrast difference with surrounding structures was pronounced (Figure1Aiii,Biii,Ciii). However, recognition was less reliable for mitochondria located within the cytoplasm of cell bodies, where the contrast was weaker. This led to increased uncertainty in the deep‐learning algorithm, requiring more extensive quality control, particularly for smaller mitochondria.

The first set of samples, prepared with heavy metal deposition, provided excellent contrast and fine ultrastructural details that were clearly revealed, with key features such as nuclear envelopes, mitochondria, and the endoplasmic reticulum easily distinguishable from the cytoplasm (Figure2Ai). Cell membranes remained sharp even after more than 200 sectioning steps (Figure2Aii). These results were consistently achieved using a low accelerating voltage of 2.5 kV and medium FCC settings. The combination of heavy metals was particularly effective in distinguishing closely packed cell types, such as satellite glial cells and neurons (Figure2Aiii), with a fixed pixel size of 5 nm. However, while the staining method provided exceptional detail in individual slices, the densely packed and complex structure of DRG tissue made achieving smooth 3D reconstructions more challenging than in the caudal nerve. Overlapping structures and inconsistent contrast along the z‐axis presented significant obstacles in generating accurate volumetric models.

In contrast, the second set of samples, prepared using standard TEM staining, exhibited reduced contrast and structural clarity. Imaging was conducted with an accelerating voltage of up to 3.15 kV, achieving a resolution of 6 nm per pixel. While larger structures such as nuclei, nucleoli, and myelin were visible, finer details—including organelles and the boundaries between satellite and neuronal cells—were often blurred due to minimal gray‐level differences (Figure2Bi–iii). The low contrast between adjacent structures made manual annotation difficult and posed an even greater challenge for automated neural networks. These limitations were particularly evident in regions with densely packed cells, where distinguishing individual features and 3D reconstruction became increasingly complex.

The third set of samples, stained en bloc with X‐solution, produced significantly sharper and more detailed images. The enhanced scattering properties of this staining method enabled imaging at very low voltages (1.5–2 kV) while maintaining a spatial resolution of 5–6 nm. Using FCC at maximum power further reduced charging artifacts, resulting in highly detailed views of organelles, nucleoli, myelin, and entire cell bodies across both the sample surface and deeper layers (Figure2Ci–iii). While these improvements facilitated individual structural analysis, reconstructing 3D models remained challenging. The dense and heterogeneous composition of DRG tissue made it difficult to achieve consistent and reliable volumetric reconstructions.

Accurate sample preparation is crucial for achieving high‐quality ultrastructural analysis, as many cellular structures remain difficult to visualize due to their inherently low contrast [13]. Additionally, proper preparation is essential for supporting sectioning [14]. The specific requirements of SBF‐SEM add another layer of complexity, often making the process labor‐intensive and time‐consuming. Standard SBF‐SEM protocols typically rely on uranyl‐based staining, but replacing this with an effective, non‐radioactive alternative would improve safety in sample preparation for ultrastructural imaging.

In this study, we compared the ultrastructural contrast achieved with the gold‐standard manual uranyl‐based staining method from Deerink et al. [9] to two alternative protocols using an automated tissue processor. This system enables the preparation of hundreds of samples through precise, time‐controlled impregnation steps. The first alternative used a standard TEM preparation to assess whether previously prepared samples could be analyzed with SBF‐SEM, despite not being specifically designed for this technique. The second tested the feasibility of a uranyl‐free staining approach.

To evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in studying the PNS, we analyzed both the caudal nerve and DRG. These sample types were selected due to their distinct histological structures, allowing for a broader comparison in imaging and 3D reconstruction. Notably, DRG samples exhibited significant charging effects under SBF‐SEM conditions, primarily due to their relatively low lipid content compared to the highly myelinated caudal nerve. Therefore, we also assessed the effectiveness of FCC in mitigating this technical challenge.

Our results demonstrated that automated tissue processing ensures consistent contrast enhancement within each sample and provides reproducible staining across batches. The time required for specimen preparation was significantly reduced to just one day—plus the time needed for resin polymerization—compared to the four full days required by manual methods. User involvement was limited to reagent preparation, sample loading, and unloading. Additionally, automation minimized reagent consumption, as multiple specimens could be processed simultaneously in shared solution tanks.

When compared to the gold standard [9], which remains superior in resolving ultrastructural details of various compartments and organelles, the standard TEM preparation and the uranyl‐free en bloc method yielded reliable results for caudal nerve samples—particularly when examining structures larger than 50 nm with high contrast relative to the background. However, these two alternative methods, especially the standard TEM preparation, were less effective for DRG analysis.

The electron doses we applied exceeded values recommended by the manufacturer and previous studies [15,16], leading to improved image quality in low‐contrast specimens [15,17]. We identified an optimal balance between minimizing charging effects and achieving high‐resolution imaging for both moderately charge‐prone (caudal nerve) and highly charge‐prone (DRG) samples. Notably, less conductive regions—such as cell nuclei, blood vessel lumens, and occasional bare resin areas—rarely exhibited charge‐related artifacts, unlike previous observations [12,14]. FCC played a critical role in this outcome, enhancing imaging quality and increasing the versatility of SBF‐SEM, even for challenging specimens.

For all sample types, we observed that negative charge accumulation decreased after a few days in the SEM chamber. This allowed us to acquire data at smaller x and y pixel sizes within that timeframe. Additionally, samples prepared using the first and third protocols incorporated hard resin formulations, which are known to better support serial sectioning [5,12]. However, no significant surface alterations were detected on specimen block faces, regardless of whether soft or hard resin was used, as confirmed by secondary electron imaging (data not shown). This stability was likely due to the combination of FCC discharge control [18] and oscillating knife cutting mode [19].

Our data processing pipeline streamlined post‐processing, improving workflow efficiency for image analysis and 3D rendering. For each tissue type, we developed a deep learning (DL) model to reconstruct specific biological structures, ensuring adaptability to variations in imaging parameters and staining conditions. Each model required approximately 50 annotations to achieve accurate segmentation, with occasional refinements necessary to enhance quality. Results were promising, particularly for well‐defined structures such as myelin and Schwann cells, which benefited from strong osmium staining. However, segmentation proved more challenging for smaller or delicate structures, especially in samples processed using the standard TEM preparation, where contrast was lower.

In conclusion, we demonstrated that automated uranyl‐free staining combined with hard resin embedding can serve as a viable alternative to the gold‐standard manual uranyl‐based staining technique, albeit with some limitations. Furthermore, we confirmed that good‐quality SBF‐SEM imaging is possible with peripheral nerve samples prepared using standard TEM protocols, enabling the analysis of previously embedded specimens even if they were not specifically prepared for 3D imaging.

Quercetin as a flavonoid polyphenol in nature has shown great anti-obesity effects. Due to its poor stability in chemical structure and low intestinal absorption, the in vivo bioavailability of quercetin is considered to be the main challenge for applications. To achieve the oral quercetin administration, chitosan was successfully trimethylated (TMC) to coat the quercetin-loaded zein nanoparticles (Zein-Q), which were designed as the core–shell structure for enhancing the intestinal absorption in this study. TMC-Zein-Q was demonstrated to protect quercetin from degradation and showed the sustained-release effect in an in vitro drug release experiment. The nanoparticles were found to reversibly open tight junctions between intestinal epithelial cells and help to increase quercetin uptake via the paracellular pathway in Caco-2 cells. In addition, the delivery system also showed stronger intestinal permeability and mucoadhesion in vivo, which improved the bioavailability of quercetin in cellular and animal experiments. After 10 weeks of intervention, TMC-Zein-Q could effectively suppress weight gain, improve serum lipid levels, and ameliorate hepatic steatosis and glucose tolerance in high-fat diet (HFD) mice by mediating the AMPK pathway. Consequently, this work successfully constructed TMC-Zein-Q for oral quercetin delivery, providing a novel and feasible strategy for the treatment of obesity via the oral route.

Quercetin is a typical flavonoid ubiquitously present in fruits and vegetables with a series of outstanding bioactivities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-obesity effects [1]. Over 650 million adults worldwide are obese, and about 1.67 billion people will have health problems due to obesity or being overweight by 2025, seriously threatening human health [2]. Accumulating evidence suggests that quercetin could ameliorate obesity by inhibiting lipogenesis, promoting lipolysis, regulating insulin sensitivity, and alleviating inflammation and oxidative stress [3,4]. However, due to its low aqueous solubility and poor stability in the gastrointestinal tract, quercetin generally exhibits low oral absorption [1]. In addition, the absorbed quercetin undergoes extensive phase II metabolism in intestinal cells [5], and most of the related metabolites are excreted back to the intestinal lumen [6], limiting the utilization of quercetin as a nutraceutical in food and supplement products. The results of human experiments showed that the absorption rate of quercetin after oral administration was only 3% to 17% [7]. The total plasma concentration of quercetin cannot reach the threshold of effective therapeutic concentration after eating quercetin-rich foods [8,9]. Among these influencing factors involved in the oral bioavailability of quercetin, the low intestinal absorption is the most important [10], and therefore, there is an urgent need to improve intestinal absorption of quercetin after oral administration.

Various delivery systems were designed to efficiently protect quercetin in the harsh gastrointestinal tract against degradation, improving its bioavailability and therapeutic effects [2]. Among these strategies, nanoparticles have been proven to be an effective strategy to improve the absorption and metabolism of bioactive compounds. They could embed bioactive compounds driven by self-assembly and release them in a controlled manner at specific sites in the body [11]. The transcellular and paracellular pathways are 2 common ways for nanoparticles to improve the absorption of bioactive compounds. The paracellular pathway can effectively avoid the efflux of bioactive compounds that undergo extensive phase II metabolism in intestinal cells, thereby increasing their bioavailability [12]. Several strategies such as poly(amidoamine) dendrimers and inorganic nanoparticles (gold and silicon) have shown improved intestinal absorption after modification via paracellular pathway [13,14]. However, the major challenges that involve the clinical translation of these nanoparticles as efficient oral delivery carriers are their toxicity and biocompatibility [13].

Food-derived materials are commonly used as nano-embedding materials due to their advantages of nontoxicity, bioavailability, nonimmunogenicity, biocompatibility, and tunability, and some of them have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical applications [15,16]. Zein is the main storage protein of corn and has been approved for use by the FDA [17]. There is a high proportion of hydrophobic amino acids in its structure, which is effective in encapsulating and loading various hydrophobic compounds. In addition, zein could spontaneously form nanoparticles with anti-gastric enzymes, making it an ideal candidate for an oral delivery vehicle [17]. However, zein nanoparticles could not avoid the efflux of quercetin, showing a limited improvement in absorption. Therefore, further methods are needed to improve the intestinal absorption of quercetin. Some cationic polymers have been shown to interact with the negatively charged intestinal epithelial cells, changing the absorption model of bioactive compounds by activating the paracellular pathway [18]. TMC is a typical cationic material modified by chitosan, which is derived from chitin, and the safety and biodegradability of TMC are well established [12]. Although chitosan is widely used in various delivery systems, its poor water solubility and stability in neutral and alkaline environments limits its further application [19]. In contrast, TMC overcomes these shortcomings of traditional chitosan. It exhibits better solubility and permeability under neutral pH conditions, enabling more efficient promotion of quercetin absorption [20]. Furthermore, the cationic properties of TMC enhance its interaction with intestinal epithelial cells, thereby improving drug adhesion in the intestine and promoting absorption across the intestinal barrier [18]. These advantages make TMC a highly promising candidate for oral drug delivery systems, particularly in applications related to anti-obesity and antioxidant effects, where it has demonstrated higher bioavailability. Therefore, TMC as a shell coated with zein nanoparticles for oral delivery of quercetin may be a potential strategy to improve quercetin absorption via the paracellular pathway.

In this study, a novel core–shell delivery system by using zein and TMC was constructed, which simultaneously exhibited intestinal permeability and mucoadhesion capacities. Following characterization of the physicochemical properties and stability, the intestinal absorption of TMC-Zein-Q was comprehensively evaluated by in vitro digestion, ex vivo imaging, and assessment of pharmacological effects. The possible mechanisms of enhanced bioavailability of quercetin were also explored based on cellular and animal experiments. Furthermore, the subsequent weight loss of nanoparticles in vivo and the potential signaling pathway were also investigated. In conclusion, our findings suggested that TMC-Zein-Q could largely increase the bioavailability of quercetin by paracellular pathway and showed great potential as an oral delivery system for obesity intervention.

Quercetin (98% purity) and zein were purchased from Shanghai Yuanye Biotechnology Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Chitosan (50 kDa, 95% deacetylation degree) andN-methyl-2-pyrrolidone were purchased from Macklin Biochemical Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Pepsin and trypsin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Methyl iodide was purchased from Titan Scientific Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (Waltham, MA, USA). Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), nonessential amino acids,l-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS), sodium azide, chlorpromazine, indomethacin, and colchicine were obtained from Solarbio Science & Technology Co. Ltd. (Beijing, China).

TMC was synthesized as previously described with some modifications [21]. Briefly, 10 g of chitosan, 24 g of sodium iodide, and 55 ml of 15% NaOH were dissolved in 400 ml ofN-methyl-2-pyrrolidone with stirring at 60 °C for 30 min. Then, under a refluxing condition, 57.5 ml of methyl iodide was added into the above mixture and reacted in the dark for 90 min. The obtained solution was precipitated by adding ethanol, centrifuged to collect the sediment, and washed with ether for 2 times. The recovered material was dissolved in 200 ml of 10% (w/v) NaCl solution followed by dialysis for 3 d. The final solid TMC sample was obtained by freeze-drying.

Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) analysis of chitosan and TMC was performed by an FTIR spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Massachusetts, USA). The sample was mixed with potassium bromide powder and pressed into transparent sheets. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectra of TMC were recorded by using an NMR spectrometer (JEOL, Akishima-shi, Japan) using D2O as solvent. The degree of quaternization of TMC is calculated according to the following formula:

where ∫TM is the peak area integral corresponding to the trimethylamine group, and ∫H is the peak area integral corresponding to the hydrogen atom bound by C1 on the glucopyranose ring.

To determine the most appropriate wall materials, nanoparticles with different ratios of zein to TMC (8:1, 4:1, 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2) were prepared. TMC was dissolved in 150 ml of ultrapure water and adjusted to pH 4.0, and 600 mg of zein (Yuanye, Shanghai, China) was dissolved in an 80% ethanol solution. The TMC solution was mixed by a high shear rate of 3,000 rpm, where the zein ethanol solution was slowly added. The TMC-Zein nanoparticles were freeze-dried after removing ethanol by rotary evaporation. The particle size and ζ potential of nanoparticles were measured by a particle size analyzer (Malvern, Marvin, UK), and the turbidity was measured by a turbidimeter (Beckman Coulter, California, USA).

The fabrication of TMC-Zein-Q was set as follows: Zein and quercetin were dissolved together in an 80% ethanol solution according to rations of 40:1, 20:1, 10:1, 5:1, and 2.5:1, respectively. Then, the solution was slowly added into TMC solution (pH 4) under high-speed shear. TMC-Zein-Q was freeze-dried and obtained following rotary evaporation and centrifugation to remove the unencapsulated quercetin. Zein-Q was also prepared as the control.

The fluorescence spectra of zein, Zein-Q, TMC-Zein-Q, and TMC-Zein were detected by fluorescence spectrometry (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) with the samples dissolved under the protein concentration of 28 μg/ml. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm, the emission spectrum was 300 to 500 nm, and the slit was 10 nm. The FTIR analysis of zein, TMC, quercetin, Zein-Q, TMC-Zein-Q, and TMC-Zein was performed with the same method mentioned above. TMC-Zein-Q was diluted by 20 times and dried on a carbon-coated copper mesh to be observed by a transmission electron microscope.

Encapsulation efficiency (EE) and drug loading capacity (DLC) were determined by measuring the amount of unencapsulated quercetin and total quercetin in the nanoparticles. TMC-Zein-Q (20 mg) was added in 5 ml of anhydrous methanol, and the suspension was vortexed and centrifuged at 10,000gfor 5 min. The content of quercetin in the supernatant was considered as the amount of unencapsulated quercetin. In addition, 20 mg of nanoparticles was dissolved in 0.5 ml of ultrapure water, followed by the addition of 4.5 ml of methanol and ultrasonic treatment for 5 min to fully destroy the nanoparticle structure. The solution was also centrifuged, and the quercetin content in the supernatant was considered as the total quercetin content. Quercetin was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) with a C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm) and a ultraviolet (UV) detection wavelength at 370 nm. A mixture of methanol and water (70:30, v/v) was used as the mobile phase. The volumes of injection were 20 μl with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. EE and DLC were calculated using the following formula:

Freshly prepared TMC-Zein-Q solutions were adjusted to pH 3.0 to 8.0 and NaCl concentration of 0 to 500 mM to evaluate the pH stability and the ionic strength stability of the nanoparticles, respectively. The samples were kept at room temperature for 3 h, and then the particle size was measured.

The method used was slightly modified according to a previous report [22]. Briefly, simulated gastric fluid (pepsin 2,000 U/ml) and simulated intestinal fluid (trypsin 100 U/ml) were prepared in advance. Nanoparticles were dissolved in ultrapure water at a protein concentration of 0.2 mM. The solution was then mixed with an equal volume of simulated gastric fluid, and the pH was adjusted to 3.0 immediately. The digestive solution was incubated in a 37 °C water bath with a shaking rate of 110 rpm for 2 h. Then, the pH of obtained chyme was adjusted to 7.0 and mixed with an equal volume of simulated intestinal fluid for 2 h under the same conditions. During the digestion process, 0.2-ml samples were taken from the digestive solution every 30 min and freeze-dried. The obtained powder was added to 0.2 ml of anhydrous methanol and vortexed for 30 s to extract quercetin released from the nanoparticles. The quercetin content in the supernatant was quantified, and 50 mg/ml of free quercetin suspension was used as the control group. The release rate of quercetin was calculated according to the following formula:

Caco-2 cells were purchased from Peking Union Medical College and cultured in a high-glucose DMEM with 10% (v/v) FBS, 1% (v/v) nonessential amino acids, 1% (v/v)l-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2and 95% humidity. The growth medium was changed every other day. For transport assays, the cultured cells (passage numbers 40 to 45) were seeded onto the Transwell permeable supports (Corning, Cambridge, USA) at 1 × 105cells/well [23]. Monolayers were fed on both sides every 2 d and cultured for 21 d before use. When the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) reached 700 to 800 Ω cm2, it indicated the formation of monolayers.

The effects of free quercetin, Zein-Q, and TMC-Zein-Q on the activity of Caco-2 cells at different concentrations were evaluated by the methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) Assay Kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Caco-2 cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 103cells per well in 96-well plates and cultured for 24 h. Cells were then incubated with free quercetin, Zein-Q, and TMC-Zein-Q at 0.2 to 1 mg/ml equivalent weight of quercetin, respectively. The control group applied HBSS to incubate cells, while the blank group only used HBSS without cells. After treatment for 12 and 24 h, the cell viability was tested by MTT assay and calculated according to the following formula:

Caco-2 cells were seeded in 12-well plates (1 × 105cells/well) and cultured to 75% to 80% confluency. Free quercetin, Zein-Q, and TMC-Zein-Q (0.8 mg/ml equivalent weight of quercetin) were used to incubate the cells for 2 h at 37 °C. Then, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were ultrasonic treated and detected by HPLC to quantify the cellular uptake of quercetin. To determine if the nanoparticle uptake was energy dependent, the Caco-2 cells were incubated with the samples at 4 °C and pre-incubated with 100 mM sodium azide for 30 min, separately. To determine the mechanism of cell uptake, the cells were pre-incubated (30 min) with endocytosis inhibitors (10 μg/ml chlorpromazine, 10 μg/ml indomethacin, or 10 μg/ml colchicine) for clathrin-, caveolae-, and macropinocytosis-dependent cell uptake, respectively [24].

Transepithelial permeabilities of free quercetin, Zein-Q, and TMC-Zein-Q were determined by using Caco-2 cell monolayers. The donor solution in the apical chamber of the Transwell plate was replaced with 0.5 ml of free quercetin, Zein-Q, or TMC-Zein-Q (0.8 mg/ml equivalent weight of quercetin). After 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 h of incubation, 100-μl samples were collected from the basolateral chamber. The concentration of quercetin in the samples was detected by HPLC. The apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) was calculated according to the following formula:

where dQ/dtis the permeation amount of quercetin per second (ng/s),Ais the diffusion area of the cell monolayer (cm2), andCis the initial concentration of quercetin in the apical chamber (ng/cm3).

During the incubation, the TEER values of the cell monolayers were measured by Millicell-Electrical Resistance System (Millipore Corporation, MA, USA). After incubation with the samples for 2 h, the cell monolayers were washed twice by PBS and subsequently cultured in fresh cell culture media. The TEER values were recorded at predetermined time intervals in the next 24 h. The percentage of TEER values relative to the initial level was calculated.

The status of tight junction between the Caco-2 cells after the incubation with nanoparticles was visualized by the immunofluorescent staining of occludin protein. Nanoparticles were prepared by replacing quercetin with Nile Red (NR) (Aladdin, Shanghai, China). The cell monolayers were incubated with free NR, Zein-NR, or TMC-Zein-NR for 2 h. Then, the cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.5 % Triton-X PBS (Solarbio, Beijing, China), and treated with 5% donkey serum (Solarbio, Beijing, China) for 1 h to block nonspecific binding. Subsequently, the cells were treated with occludin goat polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Santa Cruz, California, USA) at a dose of 1:1,000 at 4 °C overnight. Following the washing steps, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled donkey anti-goat IgG (1:100 in PBS) (Abcam, Cambridgeshire, UK) for 1 h. The stained cells were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).

Male C57BL/6J mice (6 weeks old) were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co. Ltd. (Beijing, China). They were reared in the specific pathogen-free (SPF) animal laboratory under controlled temperature (23 ± 2 °C) and relative humidity (55 ± 5%) with a 12-h cycle of light–dark. After 1 week of acclimatization, the mice were used for subsequent studies. All the procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee of China Agricultural University (AW72110202-4) and performed in strict accordance with the guidelines of the National Research Council Guidelines.

Male C57BL/6J mice were sacrificed, and their fresh duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were collected and cut into small segments (3 cm). One end of the intestinal segment was tightened with medical cotton thread, while 0.3 ml of free quercetin, Zein-Q, or TMC-Zein-Q samples (0.8 mg/ml equivalent weight of quercetin) was injected from the other end and then closed. The selected length of the intestinal segment was 3 cm. The intestinal segments were placed in 3 ml of 37 °C Krebs–Ringer buffer (Solarbio, Beijing, China). After incubation for 2 h, 100 μl of each sample was collected from the solution. The concentration of quercetin was determined by HPLC for the calculation ofPapp.

For intestinal permeability study, male C57BL/6J mice were given free NR, Zein-NR, or TMC-Zein-NR by gavage. After 2 h, the mice were sacrificed, and the small intestine tissues were collected, which were embedded in optimal cutting temperature compounds (Sakura, Osaka, Japan). The thick sections (8 μm) were cut and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. For the observation of CLSM, the nuclei and intestinal mucus were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Thermo, Massachusetts, USA) and Alexa Fluor 488 WGA (Thermo, Massachusetts, USA), respectively. For intestinal mucoadhesion study, male C57BL/6J mice were given free Cy7, Zein-Cy7, or TMC-Zein-Cy7 by gavage. The mice were sacrificed at 2, 4, 8, and 12 h, and the complete digestive systems were taken and observed under an animal in vivo fluorescence imager (Spectral Instruments, Arizona, USA).

Male C57BL/6J mice were fed by free quercetin, Zein-Q, or TMC-Zein-Q by gavage at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight. The mice were sacrificed at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h after administration (n= 4 per point), and the blood was isolated at 4 °C (3,500 rpm, 15 min). The serum samples (100 μl) were added with 20 μl of enzyme solution (800 U/ml β-glucuronidase and 200 U/ml sulfate esterase) (Sigma, Missouri, USA), vortexed for 30 s, and then treated in 37 °C water bath for 1 h. Subsequently, 20 μl of HCl solution (2.5 M), 10 μl of ferulic acid (Sigma, Missouri, USA), and 1 ml of ethyl acetate were added, followed by vortexing for 5 min and centrifuging at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was dried with nitrogen and then redissolved in 100 μl of acetonitrile for HPLC analysis, using a C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm) and a UV detector (detection wavelength = 366 nm). A mixture of acetonitrile and 0.2% phosphoric acid (30:70, v/v) was used as the mobile phase. The temperature of column was set at 30 °C, and the volumes of injection were adjusted at 20 μl with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min.

Forty male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into 5 groups (n= 8 per group): (a) control group: the mice were fed a normal chow diet (D12450J, 10% energy derived from fat, 3.85 total kcal/g, Research Diets Inc., New Brunswick, NJ, USA); (b) high-fat diet (HFD) group: the mice were fed an HFD diet (D12492, 60% energy derived from fat, 5.24 total kcal/g, Research Diets Inc., New Jersey, USA); (c) HFD with free quercetin group (HFD + free Q): the mice were fed an HFD and free quercetin (quercetin content: 50 mg/kg, once every day, intragastrically); (d) HFD with Zein-Q group (HFD + Zein-Q): the mice were fed an HFD and Zein-Q (quercetin content: 50 mg/kg, once every day, intragastrically); (e) HFD with TMC-Zein-Q group (HFD + TMC-Zein-Q): the mice were fed an HFD and TMC-Zein-Q (quercetin content: 50 mg/kg, once every day, intragastrically). All groups were fed for 10 weeks, food intake was evaluated twice per week, and body weight was recorded once per week. The energy intake was calculated by multiplying the grams of diet by the energy (kcal/g) in the diet. At the end of the experiment, the mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium and sacrificed. The blood samples were taken from the orbital vascular plexus after 12-h fasting, and the serum was isolated at 4 °C (3,500 rpm, 15 min) and then stored at −80 °C until required. The liver, epididymal fat (epi-WAT), retroperitoneal fat (retro-WAT), and perirenal fat (per-WAT) were collected and weighed. Part of these tissues was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for histological analysis, while the remainder were stored at −80 °C for further experimental analysis.

The levels of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) in serum were measured by commercially available kits according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Jiancheng, Nanjing, China).

The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was carried out at 9 weeks after a 12-h overnight fast. All mice were given 20% glucose solution (2 g/kg body weight) orally, and venous blood was collected from the tails. The blood glucose levels were measured by using a glucose meter (Byer, Shanghai, China) at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min, and the area under the curve (AUC) of glucose was calculated to reflect the glucose tolerance in this study.

The liver and epi-WAT tissues were dehydrated using a series of ethanol solutions after being fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (v/v) for more than 24 h. Then, the tissues were treated with xylene, immersed in paraffin at 65 °C, and embedded in paraffin wax. The sections of 4 μm were cut by a microtome and dried at 60 °C in an oven. After that, the slices were dewaxed with xylene and dyed with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The slices were sealed with neutral gum, dried, and viewed under a microscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Additionally, the liver tissues were also performed by Oil Red O staining. Briefly, tissues were dehydrated at 4 °C in a 15% sucrose solution and then transferred to a 30% sucrose solution at 4 °C. The dehydrated tissues were slightly dried with filter paper and embedded in optimal cutting temperature compounds. The freezing microtome (Thermo, Massachusetts, USA) was used to cut the sections (8 to 10 μm), which were dyed with oil red. Finally, the slices were sealed with a glycerol gelatin sealing agent and viewed under a microscope.

Target gene expressions were assessed using quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) on epi-WAT mRNA, which was isolated by a Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). The quantity and purity of RNA were assessed by absorbance at 260 and 280 nm, and reverse transcribed with a PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara, Osaka, Japan). Template cDNA (1.5 μl) was mixed with 0.5 μl of primers, 5 μl of TB Green Premix Ex Taq II (Takara, Osaka, Japan), and 3 μl of ribonuclease (RNase)-free water. PCRs were performed in triplicates on a LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR system according to the following program: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, 35 PCR cycles at 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 15 s, followed by a melting curve. The used primers are listed in TableS1. Relative quantification normalized against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene expression was calculated by the comparative 2–∆∆CTmethod with 6 biological replicates.

All experimental data are presented as mean ± standard error of mean (SEM). Comparisons among groups were performed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey test (SPSS v20.0, Illinois, USA) and graphed by GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, California, USA).P< 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

In the present study, a TMC-Zein nanoparticle with oral absorption enhancement was designed as a carrier to improve the bioavailability of quercetin. To improve the bioavailability of quercetin, food-derived chitosan was trimethylated to obtain TMC shell with good mucoadhesive and intestinal epithelium-penetrating properties. Meanwhile, quercetin was loaded into the hydrophobic core of zein and subsequently combined with TMC to synthesize the TMC-Zein-Q core–shell nanoparticles (Fig.1A). TMC was prepared according to Fig.1B, and the chemical structure of TMC was verified by FTIR and1H-NMR (Fig.1C and D). The presence of N-CH3in TMC was confirmed by the appearance of a new peak at 1,470 cm−1in FTIR spectroscopy. Additionally, the absorption peak at 1,599 cm−1corresponding to the hydrogen of the NH2group in chitosan was partially replaced in TMC, resulting in a decrease in absorption, which also confirmed the formation of TMC (Fig.1C). The modification efficiency of TMC was analyzed by1H-NMR. As shown in Fig.1D, in addition to the trimethyl group, the prepared TMC also contained a dimethyl group and an o-methyl group in its structure, and the degree of quaternization of the prepared TMC was 19.98%.



Design and characterization of TMC. (A) Schematic representation of the TMC-Zein loaded with quercetin. Chitosan was trimethylated to obtain TMC, and quercetin was loaded into the hydrophobic core of zein. Zein-Q was subsequently coated by TMC to synthesize TMC-Zein-Q with great intestinal permeability and mucoadhesion properties. (B) Synthesis route of TMC. 1), 2), and 3) represent the reagents and conditions at different stages of the reaction: 1) adding CH3I, NaOH, NaI,N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone; 2) adding 10% NaCl; 3) dialysis with deionized water. (C) FTIR spectra of TMC and chitosan. The appearance of a new peak at 1,470 cm−1in the FTIR spectrum confirmed the existence of N-CH3in the prepared TMC. The absorption peak at 1,599 cm−1corresponding to the hydrogen of the NH2group in chitosan was partially replaced in TMC, also confirming the formation of TMC. (D)1H-NMR spectrum of TMC. In addition to the trimethyl group, the1H-NMR spectrum of TMC also contained a dimethyl group and an O-methyl group, confirming the formation of TMC.

In order to determine the optimal ratio of the wall materials, TMC-Zein nanoparticles were prepared according to the ratio of zein:TMC = 8:1, 4:1, 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2, respectively. As shown in Fig.2A, the particle size of zein nanoparticles was 140.30 ± 0.56 nm, and the polydispersity index (PDI) was 0.13 ± 0.01. After the addition of TMC, the particle size of nanoparticles did not increase significantly, and the PDI was less than 0.2 at the ratios of 8:1, 4:1, and 2:1, indicating that the TMC-Zein particles remained small size and the distribution was uniform. However, when the ratio of Zein/TMC rose to 1:1 and 1:2, the particle size increased sharply, indicating that the addition of excessive TMC led to the adhesion and aggregation of nanoparticles. This point was also demonstrated by the higher turbidity (Fig.2B). The increase in the proportion of positively charged TMC did not significantly change the surface potential of the nanoparticles (Fig.2C). Usually, the larger proportion of polysaccharides was beneficial for improving the EE of nanoparticles, while the smaller particle was helpful for taking advantage of their high specific surface area to interact with the corresponding sites in the body. Therefore, based on the above results, zein/TMC at a ratio of 2:1 was selected for subsequent studies.

(L) Quercetin release profiles from Zein-Q and TMC-Zein-Q duringin vitrosimulated digestion process. The data are expressed as mean ± SEM (n= 3). Different lowercase letters (a, b, c, d) indicate statistically significant differences between groups (P< 0.05). Groups sharing at least one common letter are not significantly different from each other, while groups with completely different letters exhibit significant differences. FTU, formazine turbidity units.

Furthermore, to achieve the best EE and DLC, the nanoparticles with zein and quercetin at ratios of 40:1, 20:1, 10:1, 5:1, and 2.5:1 were prepared. The particle size, PDI, ζ potential, EE, and DLC of the obtained nanoparticles were shown in Fig.2D to F. The particle sizes of different nanoparticles loaded with quercetin were all around 200 to 250 nm, and the PDI was around 0.2, indicating that the addition of quercetin had little effect on the particle size and uniformity of TMC-Zein nanoparticles. The ζ potential values of all nanoparticles were almost the same as those without quercetin encapsulation (51.1 ± 0.7 mV). The EE of all nanoparticles was higher than 90%, indicating that Zein-TMC nanoparticles could effectively embed quercetin. However, the DLC of nanoparticles prepared under the condition of zein/quercetin (10:1) could reach 6.71 ± 0.07%, which was significantly higher than those of other samples. Moreover, the results of fluorescence spectroscopy showed that zein exhibited a strong fluorescence emission peak at 278 nm under the excitation of 280 nm (Fig.2G). When loading quercetin, the endogenous fluorescence intensity of both Zein and TMC-Zein nanoparticles decreased significantly, indicating that quercetin was successfully bound to the wall materials after encapsulation. The occurrence of fluorescence quenching proved that quercetin could be effectively loaded into nanoparticles, which further verified that TMC-Zein-Q had a high EE. Therefore, the ratio of zein/quercetin (10:1) was selected to prepare TMC-Zein-Q for the subsequent experiments.

The absorption peaks at 3,313.42 and 3,399.85 cm−1(-OH stretching vibration) of zein and TMC were shifted in the sample of TMC-Zein (Fig.2H). These results showed a hydrogen bond between zein and TMC, which may be caused by the amide group of zein and the hydroxyl of TMC [25]. The characteristic peaks at 1,657.97 and 1,535.29 cm−1(C=O stretching and N–H bending) in the zein spectrum, as well as the characteristic peaks at 2,926.14, 1,647.41, and 1,066.12 cm−1(C–H stretching and tilting, C=O stretching, and C–O–C stretching) in the TMC spectrum, all shifted in the TMC-Zein nanoparticle spectrum. These results demonstrated that there was a hydrophobic interaction between zein and TMC, which may be generated by the nonpolar amino acid residues in zein and the acetyl group of TMC [26]. In addition, the original C=O stretching and N–H bending characteristic peaks of zein in Zein-Q spectrum shifted, revealing a hydrophobic interaction between zein and quercetin. Based on the above results, it was speculated that zein, TMC, and quercetin form nanoparticles through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds.

Furthermore, the morphological features of TMC-Zein-Q were observed by transmission electron microscopy. Spherical zein particles coated by transparent TMC with a core–shell structure could be seen in TMC-Zein-Q (Fig.2I). According to the results of FTIR analysis, it was speculated that zein combined with quercetin to form a spherical core spontaneously, while TMC was able to coat the outside of zein particles to create a hydrophilic shell. In conclusion, the produced TMC-Zein-Q had a uniform size with the core–shell structure as well as exhibited the high EE and DLC.

In the human gastrointestinal tract, there were harsh environments including severe pH changes, high salt concentrations, and numerous proteases [27]. Nanoparticles are generally used to protect encapsulated quercetin from degradation during gastrointestinal digestion [28]. Therefore, the stability of nanoparticles is believed to be a prerequisite to exert the related functionalities in vivo. The stability of Zein-Q was impaired at pH 5.0 to 6.0, as reflected by the significantly increased mean particle size (Fig.2J). TMC-Zein-Q reversed this effect, indicating that TMC significantly improved the pH stability of nanoparticles. However, the particle size of TMC-Zein-Q increased gradually at pH 5.0 to 8.0, which may be related to the swelling characteristics of TMC under alkaline conditions [29]. In addition, with the increase of pH, the electrostatic repulsion between positively charged TMC molecules weakens the interaction between molecules, and the balance between TMC and Zein changes, resulting in matrix loosening and volume expansion. Zein-Q was very sensitive to the increase of ionic strength, with particle size increasing to 921.0 ± 33.7 nm at only 10 mM concentration of NaCl (Fig.2K). In contrast, TMC-Zein-Q had higher ionic strength stability. In conclusion, TMC-Zein-Q achieved better quercetin protection under severe pH changes and high ionic strength conditions due to the shell structure of TMC.

In order to better evaluate the digestion characteristics of nanoparticles in the gastrointestinal tract, the release of quercetin from TMC-Zein-Q was carried out by in vitro simulated digestion using gastric and intestinal fluids. During the 2-h gastric digestion stage, the release amount of quercetin in TMC-Zein-Q was only 23.78 ± 0.78 %, which was significantly lower than that of Zein-Q showing 36.66 ± 5.35 % (Fig.2L). High ionic strength and strong gastric acids were considered as the main reasons to cause serious aggregation and sedimentation of Zein-Q in the stomach. This aggregation could limit the digestion of simulated gastric fluid and showed a certain sustained release of quercetin [30]. However, when TMC shell was applied, it acted as an effective physical barrier to reduce the enzymatic hydrolysis of zein, which could further delay the release of quercetin by maintaining the core–shell structure [31]. This kind of effect was more obvious during intestinal digestion. Similarly, the release amount of quercetin in TMC-Zein-Q was only 47.07 ± 1.21% after 4-h digestion, which was still dramatically lower than that of Zein-Q. Therefore, it can be concluded that TMC-Zein core–shell structures showed an excellent sustained-release effect of quercetin, which could effectively protect quercetin from degradation and be used as an ideal delivery system for the next cellular and animal experiments.

Excellent biosafety was a prerequisite for the medical translation of nanoparticles to the clinic [32]. In our study, the results of cytotoxicity showed that the cell activity exhibited a negative correlation with quercetin dose, possibly due to the anticancer effects of quercetin, which could be toxic to cancer cells by activating apoptosis [33]. Interestingly, both Zein-Q and TMC-Zein-Q increased the cell viability compared with the free quercetin group (Fig.3A), indicating great biocompatibility in Caco-2 cells.

(B) Cellular uptake of free quercetin, Zein-Q, and TMC-Zein-Q by Caco-2 cells. The amount of cellular uptake is expressed as the amount of quercetin internalized per cellular protein. (C) Cellular uptake of quercetin by Caco-2 cells after incubation with Zein-Q or TMC-Zein-Q under different conditions. (D) Percentage of quercetin transported through Caco-2 cell monolayers after treatment with free quercetin, Zein-Q, or TMC-Zein-Q.

(F) Immunofluorescence imaging of occludin in Caco-2 cell monolayer after treatment with free NR, Zein-NR, or TMC-Zein-NR for 2 h. (G) Effect of protamine sulfate on thePappvalue of the free quercetin, Zein-Q, or TMC-Zein-Q after 2 h of incubation with Caco-2 cell monolayers. The data are expressed as mean ± SEM (n= 3 to 4). Different lowercase letters (a, b, c, d) indicate statistically significant differences between groups (P< 0.05). Groups sharing at least one common letter are not significantly different from each other, while groups with completely different letters exhibit significant differences.

Then, the research evaluated the cellular uptake amounts of nanoparticles. TMC-Zein-Q-treated Caco-2 cells significantly increased the uptake of quercetin, which was apparently due to the enhancement of nanoparticle endocytosis induced by the TMC shell (Fig.3B). Then, the mechanism of nanoparticle uptake by Caco-2 cells was investigated with different inhibitors. The uptake of quercetin by Caco-2 cells in Zein-Q and TMC-Zein-Q groups was significantly reduced under the conditions of 4 °C and with the addition of sodium azide (Fig.3C), as both conditions could block active transport processes [18]. It demonstrated that the internalization of the 2 carriers was an active transport that required the participation of energy. Interestingly, chlorpromazine, an inhibitor of clathrin-dependent cellular uptake, significantly decreased the cellular uptake of TMC-Zein-Q instead of Zein-Q. As the inhibitor of caveolin- and macropinocytosis-dependent cell uptake (clathrin-independent endocytosis), indomethacin and colchicine remarkably reduced the cellular uptake of Zein-Q, but no effect on TMC- Zein-Q. These results revealed that clathrin-dependent endocytosis was involved in the cellular uptake of TMC-Zein-Q and clathrin-independent endocytosis was related to the cellular uptake of Zein-Q. It is commonly believed that the cationic properties of chitosan enabled chitosan and its derivative to interact with negatively charged cell membranes, thereby affecting cellular uptake behavior [34]. This point was consistent with a previous study that found that positively charged particles were strictly subject to clathrin-dependent endocytosis [35]. Furthermore, clathrin-dependent endocytosis is the most common route for nanoparticle uptake in nonspecialized mammalian cells, and its endocytosis process is faster than caveolin-dependent endocytosis [36]. Therefore, we speculated that the modification of nanoparticles by TMC changed the original way of nanoparticles entering cells, which may lead to the higher uptake of TMC-Zein-Q by Caco-2 cells [37].

The paracellular pathway was evaluated using the Caco-2 cell monolayer model. During the 2-h permeability study, the permeation amount of quercetin in TMC-Zein-Q was always higher than those of free quercetin and Zein-Q (Fig.3D). After 2 h, the permeation amount andPappvalue of quercetin in TMC-Zein-Q were 3.76- and 5.7-fold higher than those of free quercetin, and 1.8- and 2.78-fold higher than those of Zein-Q, respectively. It showed that TMC significantly enhanced the permeability of quercetin in Caco-2 cell monolayers. Moreover, TMC-Zein-Q led to a dramatic reduction in the TEER values of the cell layer (Fig.3E). After removal of the incubated TMC-Zein-Q, a gradual increase in the TEER value was observed, while this observation was not found in the Zein-Q and free quercetin groups. These results indicated that TMC-Zein-Q might reversibly open the tight junctions between Caco-2 cells, thereby enhancing the permeability of quercetin [18]. Combined with the great biosafety of TMC-Zein-Q, this destruction of the tight junctions between Caco-2 cells was not caused by cytotoxicity.

Occludin protein was the major protein component in tight junctions [38]. In order to identify the effects of TMC-Zein on the tight junctions between Caco-2 cells, the distribution of occludin was observed by CLSM after treating Zein-NR and TMC-Zein-NR nanoparticles on the Caco-2 monolayers. For the free NR and Zein-NR-treated groups, the fluorescence signal of occludin protein in the cell layers showed a complete ring, proving that the cell layer was highly intact (Fig.3F). Conversely, the occludin fluorescence signal of the TMC-Zein-NR-treated group was significantly weaker, suggesting that the expression of occludin protein was down-regulated compared with other groups. It was implied by the decrease in the TEER value and the down-regulation of occludin expression that the tight junctions were opened by the TMC-Zein nanoparticles. In addition, negligible NR signals were observed in the cells treated with free NR and Zein-NR, indicating that NR given in the above forms hardly entered the cells. Strikingly, the TMC-Zein-NR group exhibited a strong intracellular NR fluorescence signal, revealing that the cellular uptake of nanoparticles was greatly enhanced by TMC-Zein.

Based on the cationic properties of chitosan, it was speculated that TMC may bind to the cell membrane of epithelial cells through electrostatic interactions, thereby affecting the tight junctions between cells [12]. Therefore, positively charged protamine sulfate was added to the sample solution to interfere with the cationic properties of TMC [39]. The result showed that thePappvalue of TMC-Zein-Q was significantly reduced in the presence of protamine sulfate. However, this effect was not found in the Zein-Q-treated group, indicating that the positive charge of TMC had an important influence on the cell uptake of TMC-Zein-Q (Fig.3G). ThePappvalue of free quercetin was also increased, which may be due to the fact that protamine was able to penetrate cells and enter the nucleus, while part of quercetin bound to protamine and entered cells together with it, resulting in increased permeability [40]. Collectively, TMC could interact with epithelial cells through electrostatic adsorption, leading to the reversible opening of intercellular tight junctions, which ultimately enabled quercetin to be transported through a paracellular pathway.

To further confirm the enhanced intestinal permeability of quercetin and better mimic the in vivo absorption, free quercetin, Zein-Q, and TMC-Zein-Q across the intestine of mice were evaluated. The quercetin transport rates showed the highest level in TMC-Zein-Q but the lowest if only free quercetin existed (Fig.4A). In addition, TMC-Zein-Q has the highest permeability in the ileum, which may be related to the sustained-release characteristics of nanoparticles. Therefore, the ileum may be the main absorption site of TMC-Zein-Q bilayer nanoparticles. Moreover, the in situ absorption of quercetin-loaded nanoparticles in the small intestine was visualized by using CLSM to evaluate the enhanced effects. The results showed that a slight signal was detected in microvilli for free NR. In contrast, stronger signals were observed within microvilli for Zein-NR, and yet the strongest signals were observed for the TMC-Zein-NR group within microvilli, indicating the highest absorption of NR (Fig.4B). These results demonstrated that TMC-Zein-Q indeed exhibited better intestinal permeability than Zein-Q and free quercetin. Combined with the results of the transepithelial transport study of nanoparticles, this intestinal permeability effect may be related to the paracellular pathway, which was reversibly opened by TMC.



Intestinal permeability, mucoadhesion, and pharmacodynamic study of TMC-Zein-Q. (A)Pappvalues of free quercetin, Zein-Q, or TMC-Zein-Q after 2-h incubation in excised intestines. The data are expressed as mean ± SEM (n= 3). (B) In vivo absorption of free NR, Zein-NR, or TMC-Zein-NR in small intestinal tissues after 2 h of oral administration. The nuclei of intestinal epithelial cells were labeled with blue fluorescence, and the hydrophilic mucus layer on the surface of small intestinal villi was labeled with green fluorescence. (C) Distribution of free Cy7, Zein-Cy7, and TMC-Zein-Cy7 nanoparticles in gastrointestinal tract after gavage administration over time. (D) Plasma concentration of quercetin after oral administration of free quercetin (50 mg/kg body weight) and TMC- Zein-Q in mice. The data are expressed as mean ± SEM (n= 4). Different lowercase letters (a, b, c, d) indicate statistically significant differences between groups (P< 0.05). Groups sharing at least one common letter are not significantly different from each other, while groups with completely different letters exhibit significant differences.

The fluorescence intensity of free Cy7 in the gastrointestinal tract decreased rapidly after oral administration, and the fluorescence disappeared completely after 12 h of gavage (Fig.4C). In contrast, Zein-Cy7 prolonged the retention of Cy7 fluorescence, and as expected, TMC-Zein-Cy7 had the longest fluorescence retention time. After 8 h of intragastric administration, there was a strong fluorescence intensity in the ileum, and low intensity fluorescence was still distributed in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum after 12 h. The fluorescence intensity of the jejunum was significantly higher than that of Zein-Cy7 at 8 h after intragastric administration. When TMC was used as the shell, the nanoparticles moved more slowly along the intestine, implying that the TMC-based nanoparticles had better mucoadhesive properties. This phenomenon may be due to the electrostatic interaction between the positively charged TMC and the negatively charged sialic acid residues on the mucosal surface [12]. Generally, the mucoadhesive property plays a beneficial role in enhancing the uptake of nanoparticles by epithelial cells [41]. It could provide a prolonged contact between the nanoparticles and the absorptive surface, thus promoting their oral absorption capacity [8].

The results showed that the plasma concentration of quercetin decreased after a brief peak (15 to 30 min), and TMC-Zein-Q effectively improved the plasma concentration of quercetin. The overall pharmacokinetic curve showed a trend of TMC-Zein-Q > Zein-Q > free quercetin (Fig.4D). As expected, TMC-Zein-Q demonstrated the highest plasma concentration of quercetin (3.89 ± 1.59 μg/ml) when compared with the Zein-Q (2.25 ± 0.37 μg/ml) and free quercetin (0.61 ± 0.06 μg/ml) groups. Moreover, the relative bioavailability of TMC-Zein-Q was increased 2.48-fold when compared with free quercetin. These observations corresponded to the results of intestinal permeability and absorption, suggesting that the enhanced bioavailability of quercetin may be attributable to the permeation-enhancing effect of TMC. In this paper, the peak time of quercetin was at 15 to 30 min, which was similar to previous studies [42]. However, the concentration of quercetin was relatively low after 2 h, which may be due to the rapid metabolism of quercetin [1].

The anti-obesity effect of TMC-Zein-Q was investigated in mice, and the results showed that the weight of mice in the TMC-Zein-Q group was significantly decreased after 1 week of intervention (P< 0.05; Fig.5A), whereas the mice in the Zein-Q group showed weight loss until 7 weeks of intervention. As expected, after 10 weeks of intervention, TMC-Zein-Q showed the most weight loss effect (P< 0.01) (Fig.5B). Furthermore, the decrease in total-WAT weight (epi-WAT, retro-WAT, and per-WAT) was found in mice with TMC-Zein-Q intervention (Fig.5C). Histological analysis showed that the size of epididymal adipocytes in the TMC-Zein-Q group was also decreased compared with the HFD group (Fig.5D). The hepatic steatosis caused by HFD was alleviated in all treatment groups, among which the TMC-Zein-Q-treated group showed the lowest liver lipid accumulation and fat cavitations (Fig.5E and F).

A growing body of clinical evidence supports the close linkage among obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia [43,44]. Serum lipids were measured, and the greatest improvements in TG, TC, LDL-c, and HDL-c were found in the TMC-Zein-Q group (Fig.6A to D). More specifically, treatment with TMC-Zein-Q decreased the TG levels in mice, while this effect was not found in the free Q and Zein-Q groups. Additionally, all intervention groups could significantly reduce the AUC of the OGTT, and TMC-Zein-Q showed the most significant effect (P< 0.01) (Fig.6E and F). Importantly, the food intake of the mice in the TMC-Zein-Q group was not different from that in the HFD group (Fig.6G and H), indicating that those beneficial effects were not due to diet intake.

Different lowercase letters (a, b, c, d) indicate statistically significant differences between groups (P< 0.05). Groups sharing at least one common letter are not significantly different from each other, while groups with completely different letters exhibit significant differences.

The adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway plays an important role in regulating energy balance and lipid metabolism, and the activation of AMPK is one of the important targets in obesity treatment. To further investigate the mechanism of TMC-Zein-Q alleviating obesity, the mRNA expression of AMPK-related upstream and downstream genes was analyzed in epididymal adipocytes. The mRNA expression results showed that all treatments reversed the changes in mRNA levels of the lipogenesis-related genesLEP,AdipoQ,ATGL,SREBP-1c,ACACa, andSCD1in mice. As expected, these reversals were most notable in the TMC-Zein-Q group (Fig.6I). Adiponectin and leptin could regulate the phosphorylation of AMPK [45], leading to the up-regulation ofATGL, the first key enzyme in lipolysis, thereby promoting the process of lipolysis. Lipid synthesis was regulated by theSREBP-1ctranscription factor [46], andp-AMPKcould inhibitSREBP-1cexpression [47], thereby reducing the activity ofSCD1andACACa.

Previous studies on improving the oral absorption of quercetin generally had no validation in vivo and thus lacked credibility [48,49]. In this study, the oral absorption enhancement effect of TMC-Zein-Q nanoparticles was evaluated in vitro and in vivo, and their anti-obesity effect was verified by animal experiments. Our results demonstrated that TMC-Zein-Q nanoparticles could effectively improve the oral absorption and anti-obesity effect of quercetin, which had a promising application.

In this study, TMC-Zein-Q core–shell nanoparticles were designed to improve the oral absorption of quercetin (Fig.7). The nanoparticles consist of quercetin-loaded zein core and TMC shell, which had high EE, DLC, and good solubility. These nanoparticles could protect quercetin from degradation and show the sustained-release effect in an in vitro drug release experiment. In addition, they exhibited good biosafety and were found to reversibly open tight junctions in Caco-2 cells to improve the absorption of quercetin through the paracellular pathway. Furthermore, nanoparticles showed stronger intestinal permeability and mucoadhesion in vivo, thus increasing the blood concentration of quercetin in mice. Additionally, TMC-Zein-Q nanoparticles showed the most weight loss effect in the obese mouse model after 10 weeks of intervention. It could significantly inhibit the weight gain in mice fed with HFD and increase the mRNA expression levels ofAdipoQandATGLwhile significantly decreasing the levels ofLEP,SREBP-1c,ACACa, andSCD1in adipocytes. Moreover, serum lipid levels, hepatic steatosis, and glucose tolerance were also improved by TMC-Zein-Q nanoparticles. All these beneficial effects might be attributed to the increased intestinal absorption caused by TMC-Zein-Q nanoparticles via the paracellular pathway, thus improving the bioavailability of quercetin.



Schematic illustration of TMC-Zein-Q nanoparticles for anti-obesity. TMC-Zein-Q nanoparticles showed great intestinal permeability and mucoadhesion, and improved the bioavailability of quercetin in mice via the paracellular pathway. They could significantly inhibit the weight gain in mice fed with HFD and increase the mRNA expression levels ofAdipoQandATGLwhile significantly decreasing the levels ofLEP,SREBP-1c,ACACa, andSCD1in adipocytes.

In conclusion, we successfully constructed the TMC-Zein-Q core–shell structure for oral quercetin delivery. These nanoparticles possessed ideal gastrointestinal stability and intestinal permeability, which could remarkably increase the anti-obesity effect of quercetin. Our results indicated that TMC-Zein-Q provided a novel and feasible strategy for the treatment of obesity via the oral route. However, the complex physiological environment of the human body may affect the function and biological activity of this delivery system, and the clinical application of nanoparticles still needs further study.

Dengue, a mosquito-borne disease predominantly found in tropical and subtropical countries like Bangladesh. The Aedes species particularlyAedes aegypticarry and transmit the dengue virus thus causing dengue fever irrespective of age, gender, race or religion. Limited studies on dengue in low endemic zone of Bangladesh are available. This study attempted to investigate factors influencing dengue among suspected patients with dengue in a tertiary level hospital at Mymensingh region of Bangladesh.

A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 381 suspected patients with dengue admitted to Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Mymensingh, Bangladesh from June 2023 to December 2023. A face to face interview was performed and there were no ignored cases in this study. Dengue infection was confirmed by a positive result of NS1 dengue antigen test if the blood sample taken within 7 days of the onset of fever, and IgM antibody test if the blood sample taken after 7th day of symptoms. The chi-square test and binary logistic regression model were used to determine the influencing factors of dengue using SPSS software (IBM version 25).

Most of the suspected patients came from urban environment (64.3%). The prevalence of dengue among suspected patients with dengue admitted at hospital was 74.3%, among them 45.9% and 28.3% were confirmed as dengue fever by NS1 antigen and IgM test respectively. Logistic regression model demonstrated that female had more likely to get dengue than male [aOR = 2.08, CI:1.09-3.93; p < 0.05]. Similarly, patients came from urban environment [aOR = 5.99, CI:3.09-11.64; p < 0.01], travel history to Dhaka in last two weeks preceding the survey [aOR = 11.21, CI:5.30-23.72; p < 0.01], participants did not use mosquito net during sleeping at day time [aOR = 2.74, CI:1.41-5.55; p < 0.01] and presence of water containers around the house [aOR = 12.00, CI: 5.69-25.29; p < 0.01] had higher chance to get dengue compared to their counterparts.

More than 25% suspected patients were not identified as dengue patients. Some factors were identified as risk for dengue. A safe working and living environment, self and community awareness and planned urbanization can help to prevent breeding of mosquito larvae that transmit dengue virus thus causing dengue.

Dengue is a growing concern and alarming public health problem in Bangladesh. Previously the dengue was endemic in Dhaka, Chattogram and Khulna divisions. But gradually it has spread throughout the country with higher incidence of deaths. Though, the government of Bangladesh advertising using Bangladesh television (BTV) channel about the sources of dengue, environment, transmissibility and availability of services and supports, people are still unaware about the associated factors thus causing dengue. On the other hand, government interventions such as destroying of breeding places and infected mosquitos, waste management and disposal, distribution of mosquito repellents, frequency of advertisement using most of the TV channels, accommodating optimum patients for both urban and rural community and overall health systems are not strong enough to prevent and control of dengue in Bangladesh. Furthermore, certain socio-demographic and behavioral factors are not being properly evaluated by government health wing. So, authors tried to extract the associated factors to provide recommendations to national and regional policy makers to develop awareness strategies and necessary actions to prevent and control of dengue in Mymensingh region, Bangladesh.

Dengue fever has considered as a substantial public health concern in Asia since 1950 [1]. Still it is a growing concern as favorable mosquito breeding temperature and environment in tropical and subtropical countries of Asian region [2]. Though the other regions such as Europe, America, Eastern Mediterranean are not free of dengue, South East Asian (ASEAN) countries account for more than half of the global burden of dengue. From 2015 to 2019 in the ASEAN region had seen a 46% growth in dengue cases, with Indonesia, Myanmar, and Thailand being some of the most highly endemic countries in the world [3]. South and Southeast Asian countries including Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka are at higher risk of dengue related mortality and morbidity due to rapid urbanization with overcrowded slums and inadequate infrastructure creates breeding grounds for Aedes mosquitoes [1,4].

In Bangladesh, the first official dengue outbreak occurred in 2000, with 5551 cases and 93 deaths [5]. Subsequently, an increasing trend was observed over time. More than 10,000 new dengue infected cases were reported in 2018 which dramatically increased to 101,354 cases and 164 deaths in 2019 [6]. However, the infected cases were declined in 2020 due to improved community awareness, strengthen authority sensitization and services, and facilitated environmental protection measures, moreover 2020 was the next year after the outbreak of COVID-19 during the period all other diseases were sub-diagnosed due to the high number of cases of COVID-19. It was markedly declined in 2020 with 1405 cases and 3 deaths [7,8]. Unfortunately, the cases and deaths were increases to 28,429 and 105 deaths in 2021 which was more than double from 2020. The re-emerging trend of dengue was evident in next year. A total of 60,078 cases and 266 deaths were reported in 2022 which was considered as second largest outbreak of dengue fever in Bangladesh since 2000 [9]. In 2023, a total of 321179 cases from different hospitals and 1705 deaths were recorded that exceeds all previous history of outbreaks in Bangladesh [10].

Dengue is a viral disease caused by an arbovirus belonging to the Flaviviridae family. There are four types of dengue viruses: DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 [11]. The four serotypes are essential for understanding dengue disease severity, developing vaccines, tracking outbreaks, and informing treatment and diagnosis strategies [12]. In Bangladesh, all four strains are present, with DENV-4 being the most common (41%), followed by DENV-2 (25%), DENV-1 (22%), and DENV-3 (13%) [13]. The viral agents of dengue are transmitted from human to human through the bite of female Aedes mosquitoes, primarilyAedes aegypti[12]. These mosquitoes typically bite during the daytime (from dawn to dusk) and breed in areas with standing water, such as puddles, water tanks, containers, and old tires, another vector of dengue in Bangladesh isAedes albopictusmore prevalent in rural and suburban areas [2,6,11].

Once infected with the dengue virus, individuals may experience a range of symptoms from mild to severe. Mild cases often include fever, headache, muscle and joint discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. These patients usually do not require hospitalization and can recover with supportive treatment at home or in an outpatient setting [14]. To confirm dengue and differentiate it from other fever such as Malaria, Chikungunya, Typhoid Fever, Leptospirosis Influenza, Japanese Encephalitis, or COVID-19 -causing illnesses, patients should undergo diagnostic tests such as NS1 antigen and DENV-specific IgM tests [15].

However, the dengue prevalent divisions of Bangladesh are Dhaka, Chattogram and Khulna. Unfortunately, the other remaining divisions including Mymensingh have also reported the dengue incidence [16]. Mymensingh division is closely bordered with Dhaka division which has been recognized as highest prevalent zone in Bangladesh, this region is most at risk for dengue. In addition, the presumptive patients are also coming to Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH), Mymensingh from neighboring divisions. To the best of our knowledge one study is available with dengue patients at a hospital in a non-endemic zone of Bangladesh, where authors investigated the severity of dengue [17]. Based on growing risk and public health burden, the present authors felt the necessary to determine the prevalence and associated factors of dengue among suspected patients with dengue admitted at a tertiary level hospital in Mymensingh region of Bangladesh.

We followed all rules and regulations of the Institute of Biological Science (IBSc), University of Rajshahi, Bangladesh, and IBSc approved this study and provided an ethical clearance letter (Memo No. 37(21)/320/IAMEBBC/IBSc). Prior to gathering data, we obtained permission from Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Mymensingh, Bangladesh, and we had extensive conversations with our selected participants regarding the aim of our research, and we took informed written consent from all participants, except for patients at aged<18years, their written consent was taken from their legal guardian.

This epidemiological cross-sectional study was conducted at the inpatient department of medicine, MMCH, Mymensingh. MMCH is a tertiary level government hospital in Mymensingh region.

Data was collected from June 2023 to December 2023 by the first author (Dr. Saiful), he was the duty doctor at dengue unit, a special ward of the inpatient department (IPD) of medicine unit of MMCH. From June to September is the monsoon season in Bangladesh. The heavy rainfall with high temperatures and humidity during the season make ideal breeding conditions for Aedes mosquitoes, which transmit dengue [18]. During the data collecting period all suspected dengue patients (381) admitted at dengue unit were considered as sample for the study. Patients were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaire through face to face at the beginning of admission and collected their socio-demographic, behavior and environmental information. Subsequently, the suspected patients were underwent dengue tests, and test results were collected from hospital records as dengue positive or negative. MMCH has special arrangements like high dependence unit (HDU) and intensive care unit (ICU) for very severe dengue cases who had lower GCS scores.

The patients were recruited as a presumptive dengue fever if they had an oral temperature of at least 100.4°F, with at least two of the dengue sign and symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, rash, body aches, joint pain or any relevant warning signs [13]. After recruitment, dengue infection was confirmed by a positive result of NS1 dengue antigen test if the blood sample taken within 7 days of the onset of fever, and IgM antibody test if the blood sample taken after 7th day of symptoms for identification of new case. Those patients who had both IgM and NS1 were negative but IgG was positive who identified as previous dengue infected patients. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent test (ELISA) technique was used to identify the NS1 antigen, anti-dengue IgM antibodies for diagnosis. NS1 antigen, anti-dengue IgM were interpreted as positive or negative reports only. Accuracy and completeness of the data were checked thoroughly on the same day of data collection. Admitted patients were suspected by MMCH, and all relevant testes for confirming as dengue patients were done by dengue unit, MMCH.

Dengue was the outcome variable of the study, and it was measured by NS1 dengue antigen test or IgM antibody test. The positive result of these tests was considered as having dengue (yes, code = 1), and negative result as not having dengue (no, code = 0).

Age, gender, education, residence, presence of water container around the house, regular cleaning of draining system at living place, use of mosquito net during sleeping at day time, travel history to Dhaka in last two weeks preceding the survey, construction site around the living place were considered as possible predictors of dengue.

Collected data were analyzed using the statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) software (IBM version 25). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. The chi-square test/ Likelihood Ratio test (if any cell frequency 0 for not 2X2 tables) and multiple binary logistic regression model were used to identify the associated factors of dengue fever. Variance inflation factor (VIF) was used to measure the amount of multicollinearity among independent variables in the logistic regression model. There is no evidence of multicollinearity problems if the value of VIF lies between 0 and 5 [19]. The logistic regression results were interpreted by adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) (lower and upper values of aOR), and p-value. The levels of significance of p < 0.01 and p < 0.05 were considered.

Table 1illustrates the sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents. The highest number of respondents was young adults (age, 20–40 years). More than half participants were males, and majority of the respondents were uneducated or primary level. More than 64% respondents came from urban areas. Among the participants, more than one-third had regular cleaned the draining system at their living place. In this study, only 18.6% respondents used mosquito net during sleeping at day time, and more than half had presence of water containers around their house. A large portion of patients had travel history to Dhaka in last two weeks preceding the survey.

Note:a, Likelihood Ratio value.

In this study, out of all suspected dengue patients (381), serological tests (NS1 and IgM) confirmed 283 (74.3%) patients were suffering from dengue. Out of total patients having dengue, 175 (45.9%) was confirmed by NS1 antigen test who came to the hospital within seven days of symptoms whereas 108 (28.3%) of patients were confirmed by dengue specific IgM antibody tests receptively who came after seven days of onset of symptoms (Fig 1).



The chi-square test showed that female had significantly (p < 0.05) higher dengue than male. The uneducated and primary educated respondents were more prone to dengue than their counterparts (p < 0.001). Consequently, urban residence, travel history to Dhaka in last two weeks, and presence of water containers around the house were significantly associated with development of dengue (p < 0.001). Furthermore, use of mosquito net during sleeping at day time had significantly less chance to get dengue (p < 0.001). It was observed that 100% adult (age ≥ 40 years) suspected with dengue were identified as dengue patients, and the likelihood ratio test showed that the association between age and dengue was significant (p < 0.001). Regular cleaning and construction site around the living places were not significantly associated with developing dengue (p > 0.05) (Table 1).

The significant associated factors provided by Chi-square test were considered as independent variables in multiple binary logistic regression model where dengue fever (yes or no) was considered as dependent variable. Though age was a significant associated factor of dengue provided by Likelihood Ratio test, but we did not consider the variable as independent variable in logistic model due to 100% suspected adult (age ≥ 40 years) patients were identified as dengue patients. VIF showed that there was no evidence of multicollinearity problems among independent variables in the model. After controlling the effects of other variables, the model demonstrated that female had more likely to have dengue than male [aOR = 2.08, CI: 1.09-3.93; p < 0.05]. Participants came from urban environment had more chance to have dengue fever compared to rural respondents [aOR = 5.99, CI: 3.09-11.64; p < 0.01]. Participants who had travel history to Dhaka in last two weeks were more likely to get dengue fever compared to participants who did not travel. We found that respondents who did not use mosquito net during sleeping at day time had a 2.7-fold higher change to have dengue fever compared to participants who used the mosquito net at day time [aOR = 2.743, CI: 1.411-5.333; p < 0.01]. Presence of water containers around the house was an important predictor of dengue fever, participants had presence of water container within and around their house were more vulnerable to get dengue fever compared to their counterparts [aOR = 12.00, CI: 5.69-25.29; p < 0.01]. Uneducated or primary educated participants were more likely to get dengue fever than higher educated participants [aOR = 2.83, CI: 1.66-4.85; p < 0.01]. The Negelkerke R2-value showed that the model can able to explain the variation of dependent variable by nearly 60% (Table 2). Moreover, the accuracy of the test was measured using the ROC curve. The area under the ROC curve was 0.913, which means that in 91.3% of the cases, the model correctly assigned a higher probability of having dengue fever to the subject who actually got it (S1 Fig).

In this study, 381 suspected patients were enrolled between June and December, 2023 from Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH), Mymensingh to investigate dengue fever of suspected patients. We found around 74% confirmed cases which showed dengue symptoms that corresponding to serological test results. Based on duration of illness, two types of tests were done for confirmation and management of dengue fever. The NSI antigen test is the gold standard for detecting dengue within seven days of illness and after seven days, the recommended test is IgM antibody test. As the suspected patients were coming to MMCH during the different phases of illness, the hospital ensured its confirmation following both diagnostic methods corresponding to symptoms. We found 45.9% and 28.3% positive dengue through NS1 antigen test, and dengue specific IgM antibody test receptively. An earlier study in Bangladesh showed that positivity rates of 69% for the NS1 antigen test and 65% for the dengue-specific IgM antibody test [20]. In comparison, China reported an NS1 antigen positivity rate of 82.9% and an IgM antibody positivity rate of 49.5% [21] while Myanmar showed NS1 antigen and IgM antibody positivity rates of 67.1% and 83.9%, respectively [22]. Additionally, higher NS1 antigen positivity rates in China may suggest more acute phase infections, whereas the elevated IgM antibody rate in Myanmar indicates a larger proportion of samples collected during the later phase of infection.

As a part of tropical area, the climate of Bangladesh is mainly divided into two monsoons (wet and dry monsoons). Dengue cases are more reported during monsoon months when relative humidity is higher. The higher humidity during the rainy season facilitates the growth and survival of infected mosquitoes for the successful propagation of the virus [19,20]. The dengue can affect people irrespective of gender, residence, education level. We found 205 (53.8%) male patients, of them, 140 (68.3%) had dengue positive. On the other hand, out of 176 (46.2%) female patients, 143 (81.3%) had positive test results indicates that female had significantly higher chance of developing dengue. This might be due to more exposed to household water containers particularly during cleaning process, less use of mosquito net while sleeping at day time. Though another study in Bangladesh found male had higher chances of getting bitten by Aedes mosquito at working place than women [23]. We analyzed the socio-demographic and environmental factors and found more cases from urban area (83.3%). The mosquito breeding places and environment such as construction sites around the house, open waste and dirt, old vehicle tires, uncleaned and open drainage, poor hygiene practice, improper environmental sanitation, clean water containers inside the house, poor mosquito control measures are available in urban areas that increasing the risk of spreading dengue virus through Aedes mosquito. As Bangladesh is rapidly urbanizing country, it favors the risk of spread of dengue among urban visitors and residents [24]. Several studies found similar results which has validated our study [17,23,25–27]. The education and life style factors significantly affect the behavior of individual and families. In our study, we found uneducated and primary educated patients had more dengue (83.1%) than their counterparts. This may indicate the level of knowledge, awareness and attitude towards prevention of dengue. Another study in Caribbean region of Colombia also found similar results [28]. The behavior related another factor we considered in our study which was ‘use of mosquito net while sleeping at day time (dawn to dusk)’. As Aedes mosquito usually bite at day time, we extracted the practice level and found around 18% use rate. Of them, less percentage (56%) of occurrence of dengue was found among mosquito net users indicate its benefits to prevent dengue. A study conducted in Karnataka, India provided similar significant result about the correlation between using mosquito net with reducing dengue epidemics [29]. Like the mentioned factors, history of travel was another crucial factor which was significantly associated with developing dengue. Majority of our study participants (62.5%) had frequent travel history to Dhaka as resourceful capital for job, business, or other opportunities. Dhaka is the worst hit area and the epicenter of dengue outbreak, with more than half of the cases being reported in this megacity. In our study, those who travelled in last two weeks, they had 82.8% dengue positive results. Different studies in Bangladesh showed that travel to epidemic and endemic city like Dhaka can increase the risk of dengue [17,30]. Subsequently, those who had water containers within and around the living place, they had higher chance to get dengue than their counterparts. The water containers are the suitable place for mosquito breeding thus facilitating dengue transmission opportunity. To prevent the dengue transmission, several studies and available mass media advertisement warn about cleaning of water containers around and within the living places at least every three days’ interval [11,13].

We did not measure the association between severity and its associated factors, poor-rich association, specific prevalence in different geographic locations or districts within and outside the Mymensingh division. We did not analyze the rate of dengue among different occupations. We did not analyze the treatment outcome (deaths and cure rate), and signs and symptoms. These factors would provide potential clues to researchers for further study. We used non-probability sampling for selecting sample which was limited in generalizing the findings.

Dengue fever is sometimes a severe and debilitating disease that may be caused widespread anxiety, panic, and disruption. This study attempted to determine the prevalence and associated factors of dengue among suspected patients with dengue admitted at hospital to take appropriate steps, interventions, and educate the general public. The main concern is that dengue is rapidly spreading throughout the world, and there is no potential or specific treatment or vaccine. Bangladesh is struggling to aware, inform and educate people to prevent and control of dengue through destroying breeding places, preventing through using mosquito net or repellents, and providing symptomatic treatment and managing complications. As it recently become one of the top causes of hospitalization and death among children and vulnerable individuals, posing a significant challenge to the health-care system. Mass awareness with environmental cleaning, sanitation, regular cleaning of living and working areas, planned infrastructure development, proper garbage and waste disposal systems, and practice of various preventive measures can benefit the people through reducing sufferings and risk of deaths. Moreover, the study recommends strengthening healthcare infrastructure, promoting community-based vector control, developing national dengue control programs, improving public health communication, ensuring affordable access to preventive measures, and collaborating with international organizations for effective dengue management. The overall findings of the study could help physicians and health personnel to detect dengue from clinical suspicion correctly.

Keywords:behaviour change, intervention, widening access, widening participation

Widening participation (WP) in medicine is critical to enhancing diversity within the medical community, and there has been significant investment made to promote participation in medicine amongst historically underrepresented groups. Whilst progress has been made in terms of widening access (WA) to university to study medicine amongst underrepresented groups, it has become evident that the challenges that these students face over the duration of their studies do not simply disappear once they enter medical school. For example, students from WP backgrounds have reported experiencing challenges whilst at university in relation to a lack of preparedness and struggling to fit in [1]. Accordingly, it is imperative that inclusive learning environments are embedded within medicine. These will promote equity [2] and consider how support needs may differ in accordance with individual circumstances—particularly amongst underrepresented groups. To successfully embed inclusive learning environments, we need to understand how WP students may be best supported over the course of their undergraduate medical studies.

A previous evaluation [3] of a Gateway programme, a pipeline pre‐medicine programme established in 2017, identified a key element that has been perceived to contribute to what works and enables students to successfully apply to medicine, that is, the development of supportive relationships with others. Similarly, Sartania, Aldrige and Ray [1] have stressed the importance of ensuring that students from WP backgrounds have a strong support network over the course of their studies. Whilst we know that support provision is instrumental to students from WP backgrounds in promoting flourishing, little is known about the requirements for creating a supportive environment for WP students. How may they be best supported, from their perspective, over the course of their studies and training to thrive and flourish? This research aimed to address this evidence gap and develop an intervention strategy for WP students, throughout their undergraduate academic journey.

It is critical to ensure rigour and robustness, any intervention strategy should be both evidence‐based and theory‐informed [4,5]. The use of theory in healthcare professions education (HPE) is recognised as a means of promoting quality and rigour in research, and there are many excellent examples of how theory may be integrated into research design and interpretations [6]. Researchers studying HPE can select a plethora of theories from a variety of disciplines, including but not limited to sociology, psychology, learning and organisational approaches, to ‘frame’ and inform their research.

However, behaviour change theories are a relatively new paradigm [7] within the field of HPE research and have much to offer in terms of promoting the development of evidence based and theory‐informed innovations [8]. Therein, this research aimed to develop an evidence‐based and theory‐informed intervention strategy to support WP students' to flourish in medicine. Whilst the data presented is from one medical school, the key messages and outcomes of the study will be beneficial to those working in similar contexts where there is significant investment and innovation in WP to medicine.

This research aimed to develop an evidence‐based and theory‐informed intervention strategy to support WP students' to flourish in medicine.

This was a qualitative study with data collected from stakeholders via cocreation workshops with the aim of developing an evidence‐based and theory‐informed intervention strategy. The development of the intervention strategy was undertaken using a systematic qualitative methodology grounded in the relevant theory. The study was undertaken at a Scottish University that offers both a pre‐medicine for students from WP backgrounds (Gateway programme) and undergraduate medical programme (MBChB).

Supporting WP students' to flourish in medicine requires institutional commitment [1]. Therein, it was recognised that the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation–Behaviour (COM‐B) model and the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) [9] underpinned by the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) [10,11] were appropriate frameworks to adopt and to develop an intervention strategy. We adopted this approach as it is a unification of multiple behaviour change theories and therefore does not confine researchers to selecting just one theoretical approach.

The TDF was developed initially via a consensus exercise and is a synthesis of a plethora of behavioural theory condensed into 12 domains [10], which was later expanded to 14 [11]. The TDF is a determinant framework [10] and hence may be particularly beneficial in understanding barriers and facilitators of behaviours. The TDF has been used within HPE previously; examples include identification and exploration of factors affecting direct observation of trainees in relation to their clinical performance [12] and barriers and facilitators of effective interprofessional teamwork in operating theatres [13].

As aforementioned, the TDF can either be used as a standalone framework or be integrated within the BCW method that is a comprehensive and systematic approach to inform intervention development. TDF domains can be mapped to one of the three interrelated components specified in the BCW (see [10] for mapping). The developers outline Capability, Opportunity and Motivation; all of which, they posit, contribute to the enactment of a behaviour and therein, a system referred to as COM‐B. Components of the COM‐B can be matched to relevant intervention functions and policy categories to further inform and refine intervention development. Relevant components of the BCW can then be mapped to key Behaviour Change Techniques using the Behaviour Change Taxonomy [14].

All staff who taught on the MBChB at the University were invited to participate in the research. Students enrolled in the MBChB and who had completed a Gateway programme for students from WP backgrounds or who met WP criteria prior to entry (outlined in Table1) to the MBChB were eligible to participate.

WP criteria used with our sample.

Note:Prior to secondary school, the applicant was not schooled in English (e.g., the applicant did not speak English when starting secondary school).

We estimated that we would require 10–12 participants across a minimum of two workshops to achieve data sufficiency. This estimation was based on Malterud et al.'s [15] guidance on information power, in that we (i) required a small‐sized sample since our aim was focussed, (ii) were recruiting specific participant characteristics, for example, students who fulfilled WP criteria (as per the criteria outlined in Table below and in line with university admissions criteria), (iii) intended to utilise theory to interpret findings, (iv) expected to attain a strong dialogue with participants based on the researchers' experience of conducting qualitative research, and (v) were using a case approach to analysis.

All students and staff at the University, who taught (i.e., educationalists), on the Gateway and MBChB programmes were emailed by an administrator with details of the study—two reminder emails were sent at fortnightly intervals. Snowball sampling was also undertaken wherein interested staff and students were asked to pass on details of the study to those that might be interested using their personal contacts and networks. In addition, a medical student society disseminated details of the study via their social medial channels and internal email distribution lists. Participants provided written informed consent.

The research utilised a codesign approach [16], whereby the target population was directly involved in intervention conception (e.g., framing the problem) and design (e.g., design criteria and plan prototype). Accordingly, the codesign approach adopted in this research was conducted in multiple stages with equal input from stakeholders including WP students enrolled on the MBChB and educationalists. Two student interns were involved in the design of the recruitment strategy and workshops in addition to assisting with workshop delivery, data collection and analysis. Two workshops were undertaken with WA students and educationalists involved in the delivery of the MBChB. Each workshop was audio recorded using a digital audio recorder.

The workshops endeavoured to determine key support areas within the MBChB that currently work along with identifying areas that require improvement to formulate ideas on what might work to support WP students throughout their studies going forward. Workshop participants were asked to develop fictional characters based on their experiences (as either a student from a WP background or as a staff member in their professional roles). These fictional characters were based on the idea of ‘personas’ as has been widely adopted in user design research and perceived to be beneficial in focussing efforts to develop solutions on the needs of the end user [17]. This particular approach was adopted, as it permitted workshop participants to consider the individual needs of the proposed user, for example, in this case, a student from a WP background. We also felt adoption of this method safeguarded student's experiences—the use of the persona allowed them to draw on their experiences without specifically disclosing their own background [18].

The workshops endeavoured to determine key support areas within the MBChB that currently work along with identifying areas that require improvement to formulate ideas on what might work to support WP students throughout their studies going forward.

Using the fictional character, participants were encouraged to think about specific challenges the character may face in relation to their background. The definition of WP is broad and hence, focussing on a specific character and the challenges they faced allowed participants to narrow their focus. This was critical as workshops were time limited due to funding resource and research staff time. The workshops led to the identification of key priority areas and associated target behaviours, with which to focus an intervention strategy, the generation of potential intervention ideas, and consideration to the feasibility of implementation. The intervention ideas were developed separately by staff and student groups in siloed workshops. This was purposively done to avoid power imbalance and acquiescence.

Relevant excerpts were identified, extracted, and transcribed from the workshop audio recording by two researchers (K.G.S. the PI, who is a chartered psychologist with expertise in behaviour change, and a research assistant, M.D., who has a background in psychology) and coded in accordance with the 14 domains outlined in the TDF, for example, quotes matched deductively to each domain of the TDF. The aim of the coding exercise was to identify key barriers and facilitators that promote support for WP students in their medical studies in relation to each of the target behaviours identified by workshop participants as being of significant importance. TDF domain data were then mapped to components of the BCW, in accordance with each stage of the wheel, by K.G.S., and independently checked by A.L., who also has expertise in behaviour change. Disagreements in coding were resolved via discussion. The mapping exercise was then used to formulate the intervention strategy representing each of the target behaviours identified as priority areas in the workshops [18].

Ethical approval was granted by the School of Medicine, Medical Sciences and Nutrition Ethics Review Board (SERB/2023/1/2469) in February 2023.

Four groups (two staff and two student groups) developed characters (e.g., Figure1) and intervention ideas across three different workshops. Intervention ideas were generated out of the priorities identified by workshop participants in relation to the challenges facing the fictional characters they developed. Participants identified a key target behaviour that is related to their priority area, and interventions were developed around promoting/changing these. We outline details of two of the intervention ideas and the behaviour they address below.



Fictional character developed in workshop.

Intervention ideas were generated out of the priorities identified by workshop participants in relation to the challenges facing the fictional characters they developed.

The intervention idea developed from the staff workshop specifically targeted:developing positive supportive relationships with staff. Relevant TDF domains were coded as follows: knowledge (e.g., of the local context); skills (e.g., developing study skills); environmental context and resources (e.g., not being able to visit family regularly); social influences (e.g., not being familiar with university culture); professional/social role and identity (e.g., not having family connections in medicine); beliefs about capabilities (e.g., not having confidence in ability to do medicine); beliefs about consequences (e.g., stigma associated with seeking student support); reinforcement (e.g., reinforcing that it is okay to seek help) and emotion (e.g., stress from working too much). As identified in the TDF analysis, participants discussed that students often struggled with the stigma of seeking support at university.

Participants considered one way to overcome this was via the pre‐existing personal tutor scheme. The group outlined that it was critical for students to develop trusting and open relationships with personal tutors. Although it was suggested that it might be ideal to match students from WP backgrounds with staff members who had similar experiences, they realised that this would be difficult to implement due partly to student numbers and perhaps because personal tutors may have not declared their backgrounds. Therefore, they suggested a mechanism was developed whereby personal tutors could share good practice and experiences about challenges that students from WP backgrounds may face. It was proposed that a means of doing this would be via revising the existing handbook for personal tutors and also, setting up contracts with students to agree expectations of the relationship.

Participants also felt that it was important that personal tutors were aware if any of their students fulfilled WP criteria upon entry—information that they thought could be passed onto them by administrative staff. Lastly, they felt that the current expectations around personal tutors meeting students on a once per semester basis were too infrequent for students facing challenges and perhaps this could be tailored in accordance with need to ensure students were adequately supported.

A specific intervention outlining how the development of positive relationships with staff could be fostered is presented below (Table2) and encompassed the aforementioned points. Key components of the intervention would be to increase knowledge amongst personal tutors of challenges facing students from WP backgrounds; to signpost students to relevant student support services and resources within the local community; to frame support seeking as positive; and to provide guidance on how to seek support when needed.

Sharing of good practice amongst personal tutors in order to increase pool of personal tutors. Promoting more frequent contact with students and advising personal tutors of students who fulfil WP criteria upon entry.

This intervention specifically targeted:Promoting a sense of belonging in students from WP backgrounds. TDF analysis identified the following domains: skills (e.g., learning to use different study techniques suitable to medicine); environmental context and resources (e.g., experience of culture shock); social influences (e.g., peer comparison to those with financial security—not feeling that you can do as well as others); professional/social role and identity (e.g., issue with developing relationship with mentor from more privileged background) and emotion (e.g., feeling isolated from others). Students discussed that they felt it was important to have others who were more senior to them and who had a WP background to act as role models and mentors to students in earlier years.

Participants highlighted how pursuing career aspirations as a student from a WP background looked different. They advised that costs were often a significant barrier, for example, in relation to intercalation (funding an extra year of living costs) or gaining research experience (which is often paid less than their part time job, hence making it unaffordable for them to undertake). Participants were conscious of the negative impact this could have on their competitiveness when it came to specialty choice and training. In addition, they discussed how they were concerned about getting into specialty training in terms of the ‘how’ of it, and also, what the next steps were for them. They felt that they are now seeing role models in medicine, with similar backgrounds to themselves, and connecting with them was key to promoting a sense of belonging.

Participants proposed a university WP to medicine peer support group should be established whereby MBChB students in their early years were matched with a senior medical student or trainee with a similar background. It was suggested that the network would provide support for students from WP backgrounds via regular events and informal meetings with those more senior.

A specific intervention outlining how a sense of belonging could be promoted amongst students from WP backgrounds is presented below (Table3) and encompassed the aforementioned points. Key components of the intervention would be to establish a WP to medicine peer support network for MBChB students; prompt support seeking where necessary in students and provide students with role models who had similar backgrounds to them who were at a more senior stage of their studies/training.

Development and implementation of a WP support network for students from WP backgrounds. The network will provide support for students from WP backgrounds via regular events and informal meetings with senior medics and trainees from WP backgrounds

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use an intervention development framework (Behaviour Change Wheel) to develop an intervention strategy to support the retention, and thriving, of students from WP backgrounds. The strategy outlined two separate intervention ideas to promote: the development of supportive relationships with academic personal tutors via adaptation of an existing scheme, and a sense of belonging amongst students from WP backgrounds via implementation of a WP peer support network.

The strategy outlined two separate intervention ideas to promote: the development of supportive relationships with academic personal tutors via adaptation of an existing scheme, and a sense of belonging amongst students from WP backgrounds via implementation of a WP peer support network.

Our findings demonstrate how relevant intervention development frameworks may be conceptualised by healthcare professions educational researchers to support the development of educational interventions for students in higher education settings and crucially, highlights the types of interventions which are perceived by students from WP backgrounds to be beneficial in their medical education journey and which could be implemented in similar contextual settings where WP is a significant focus. Whilst the types of interventions proposed are not necessarily new or novel, they were perceived to be significant to students from WP backgrounds in supporting them over the course of their studies. They highlight how current provisions in undergraduate medical education do not necessarily serve the needs of students from diverse backgrounds and may require adaptation to promote equity. They also speak to the systemic social injustices that are embedded in medical education today and that may detract from the creation of inclusive learning environments.

The interventions developed in this study focussed on developing supportive relationships with academic staff, in the form of personal tutors, and with students and senior clinicians from similar backgrounds. The focus of these interventions on support provision resonates with previous research [3] in WP to medicine, where the importance of developing supportive relationships with academic staff and peers was highlighted as a key mechanism in supporting positive transitions in medicine. The need for students from WP backgrounds to feel ‘connected’ with those from similar backgrounds when in medical school has been previously [1] established and hence, the focus of the suggested interventions in this study on fostering social connections with others who share similar trajectories into medicine is perhaps unsurprising.

It is well established that social inequality is reproduced in higher education settings [19], and our findings on the need to connect with those with similar backgrounds suggest that this is perhaps reflected to some degree in the student psyche. We could consider this as a direct reflection of the higher education mainstream culture in which these students find themselves embedded in where they, out of necessity, feel they need to cluster in groups with those that they share a similar background (homophily). Indeed, Mavor et al. [20] suggest that developing a strong sense of shared identity with other medical students may buffer against the effects of stress. However, conversely, Lin [21] has suggested that group clustering around shared characteristics could potentially lead to the formation of resource poor social networks that lack the same social capital as groupings that form heterogeneously, which by contrast, tend to be resource rich. Hence, it is imperative to strike a balance on fostering social connectedness amongst students from WP backgrounds whilst also promoting upwards social mobility in terms of fostering connections in medicine which allow them to pursue their career ambitions.

Students and staff in our workshops stressed that a key component of the interventions they developed was to ensure that students were encouraged, and directed, to relevant support. The challenges facing some students from WP backgrounds do not simply disappear upon entry to university. For example, some students, perhaps who are estranged from family or care‐leavers, do not have access to the same family support networks as others. To exemplify, research [22] into the experiences of care experienced students in higher education has highlighted the importance of having a supportive adult within the institution who had knowledge of that young persons' background and provided ongoing support which was relational and authentic.

Accordingly, whilst the students in this study recommended implementation of a WP peer support network to facilitate enhancing their social network and connectedness, caution should be exercised that the separation of students from the traditional entry student body does not sacrifice their inclusion in wider, beneficial social networks that promote social advancement [19]. However, with that said, due regard should also be given to the ongoing challenges that some students face over the course of their educational journey and their related ongoing support needs.

The aforementioned intervention ideas speak to the importance of promoting a sense of belonging amongst students from underrepresented backgrounds within medicine. Indeed, ‘belonging’ is a concept gaining increasing prominence within the literature [23,24]. However, as has been cautioned [24]: supporting students to ‘fit in’ to dominant social and cultural norms of institutions ‘… can perpetuate the dominant social discourses, with the potential of framing traditionally underrepresented students as underprepared for the rigours of medical school’. We were cognisant of this when developing the study initially and hope, that by undertaking a codesign approach to intervention design, we have moved beyond the discourse of encouraging students to ‘fit in’ to the dominant discourse to promote a sense of ‘belonging’. We have made efforts, by involving students in research design, delivery and interpretation, to harmonise institutional and student discourses to ensure student support is more equitable to those from WP backgrounds.

Whilst the intervention development framework, BCW [9], has allowed us to develop an intervention strategy to support students from WP backgrounds in their journey through medicine, the intervention ideas developed would benefit from further refinement with both staff and students to ensure that they promote social justice and equity. In addition, they may require further tailoring to ensure that they are institutionally feasible, for example, with increasing student numbers and online learning. Once refined and implemented, they will need to be evaluated. Evaluation should be supported by a relevant theory such as the realist approach that has previously been used to evaluate interventions in WP (e.g., [3,25].

This study has demonstrated how an intervention development framework (BCW) can be used to develop interventions for students from WP backgrounds. Two intervention ideas were developed from the research with staff and students and were designed to promote support seeking, social connection and a sense of belonging in students from WP backgrounds. Whilst we support further development and implementation of the interventions, we would caution that higher education institutions need to ensure balance in terms of implementing student support interventions and creating an inclusive climate. Accordingly, consideration should be given to the implementation of interventions that are both attuned to the needs of the students they are targeting whilst also being mindful that they do not, in their very essence, perpetuate existing social inequalities.

The aims of this scoping review were to (i) describe what foot and ankle strengthening exercises have been recommended in the scientific literature, (ii) compare the prescription of these exercises to best practice recommendations, and (iii) assess the completeness of the reporting of these exercises and exercise programs.<h4>Methods</h4>This scoping review was conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews. A systematic search of peer-review journal articles was conducted on 23 February 2023. Study designs that were included were experimental, quasi-experimental, feasibility, pilot studies, and observational. For each study included in the review, study design and participant details such as age, sex, and conditions treated were noted. To describe the foot and ankle strengthening exercises, each exercise was noted, which included its name, the number of sets and repetitions recommended, the load type and its magnitude, and whether there were any progression strategies. Exercises were grouped according to primary movement and a general exercise descriptor. To compare to best practice, each program's prescription parameters of frequency, intensity, and time were compared to the American College of Sports Medicine's (ACSM) guidelines. To assess completeness of reporting, each study was assessed with the Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template (CERT).<h4>Results</h4>The search yielded 1511 documents, and 87 were included after full-text screening.

Across all studies, a total of 300 foot and ankle exercises were prescribed. The most common strengthening exercise category involved ankle plantar flexion (25% of 300 exercises), followed by plantar foot intrinsics (16%). The most common prescription of strengthening exercises included 3 sets (37%) of 10 repetitions (38%) performed 3 times per week (34%), often without a prescribed load (66%). Prescribed sets per muscle group met ACSM recommendations for novice lifters in 93% of studies.

Foot and ankle muscle strengthening exercises are a common treatment modality for managing foot and ankle musculoskeletal conditions [1]. For example, strengthening exercises have been prescribed for several foot and ankle conditions to reduce pain and improve function [2,3,4]. They can also be used to improve strength for increased athletic performance and to provide general psychological benefits [5,6,7]. There are a multitude of strengthening exercises that are commonly prescribed, but there is ongoing debate about whether current exercise prescriptions effectively optimize strength gains [8,9,10,11]. In addition, strengthening exercises, as well as exercises more generally, have been criticized for being poorly reported, which can lead to inconsistent prescription and poor reproducibility [12,13,14].

To ensure optimal exercise prescription, researchers and clinicians should consider how exercises are prescribed and the quality of their reporting. Fortunately, guidelines have been developed to provide structure for both the prescription and reporting of exercise [15,16]. TheAmerican College of Sports Medicine(ACSM) has developed guidelines to provide recommendations for the optimization of strengthening exercise prescription [15]. These guidelines provide advice on the appropriate dosage of exercise training variables such as frequency (times per week), intensity (load type, magnitude, and progression), and time (sets and repetitions) to achieve maximal strength gains. In addition, for the reporting of exercises, theConsensus on Exercise Reporting Template(CERT)—a 16‐item minimum checklist to improve the reporting of exercise programs—was developed to improve transparency and reproducibility in clinical and research settings [16]. However, it is currently unclear whether exercises to strengthen the foot and ankle meet best practice guidelines or are being reported appropriately.

Therefore, the aims of this scoping review were to (i) describe what foot and ankle strengthening exercises have been recommended in the scientific literature, (ii) compare these exercise prescriptions to best practice recommendations, and (iii) assess the completeness of the reporting of these exercises and exercise programs.

This study is a scoping review that utilized a systematic literature search. To provide a robust framework, the review was conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews and is reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews [17,18].

Studies needed to have been reported in a peer‐reviewed journal.

Study designs included the following: experimental and quasi‐experimental (including randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized controlled trials, and single‐group pre‐post intervention studies), feasibility and pilot studies (randomized and nonrandomized), and observational studies (including case series, case reports, case‐control, and cohort studies). Systematic reviews were not included; however, the original studies included in any systematic review were considered for inclusion.

Studies were included if foot and ankle exercises were prescribed as part of a strengthening program for adults (aged 18 years or over) with or without musculoskeletal conditions or injury, and the program was prescribed for 1 week or longer. Studies were excluded if participants had chronic or systemic neurological or cardiovascular disorders, such as diabetes, neuropathy, and Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease.

Studies that provided foot and ankle strengthening exercises across multiple sessions were included. Studies where an exercise was prescribed for immediate pre‐post testing (e.g., assessing the intrinsic muscle activation during or immediately after the performance of the short foot exercise) or used special equipment that is not readily utilized in clinical practice (e.g., isokinetic strengthening machines) were excluded. If a study mentioned that rehabilitation was performed without specifying “strengthening” or the exercises themselves, these were also excluded. All foot and ankle strengthening exercises in a study were included in the analysis.

A systematic search was conducted on 23 February 2023 (Supporting InformationS1). The Ovid platform was used to search Ovid MEDLINE (1946‐present) and CINAHL (1980‐present). To broaden the search, some terms were truncated with wildcard symbols. All keywords were searched in title, book title, abstract, original title, name of substance word, subject heading word, floating subheading word, keyword heading word, organism supplementary concept word, protocol supplementary concept word, rare disease supplementary concept word, unique identifier, and synonyms. All titles and abstracts found in the search were imported to Zotero 6.0 (Digital Scholar, Vienna, Virginia, USA) for inclusion assessment. After duplicate removal, articles were then assessed based on the title and abstract by the primary author (J.W.A.O.) for inclusion in the review. Articles deemed appropriate for inclusion had the full text obtained and reviewed for eligibility requirements. Once eligibility was determined, each article was analyzed and relevant data extracted by the primary author with spot checks by two other reviewers (M.P.C. and K.B.L.). A PRISMA flow diagram (Figure1) is included to document the phases of the systematic review. Gray literature and the reference lists of systematic reviews and articles that met inclusion criteria were also hand‐searched for additional relevant articles.

Data were extracted from studies included in the review by the primary author (JWAO) using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington, USA). The data included details about the study design, population targeted for recruitment, conditions treated, mean age, and sex of participants. Exercise data were extracted defining the exercises prescribed, including the name of the exercise. The primary author then grouped exercises by context to enable categorization of the primary movement and a general exercise descriptor. Further exercise prescription details were extracted including frequency (exercise frequency and duration of program), intensity (load intensity, load type, and progression of exercise), and time (sets, repetitions, etc.).

The population targeted for recruitment into each study was documented as stated in each article's text.

The conditions treated needed to be specified in the text. Specific conditions were grouped according to broad categories. For example, midportion and insertional Achilles tendinopathy were grouped as “Achilles tendinopathy” and chronic and functional ankle instability were grouped as “ankle instability”.

Exercises were grouped according to the primary movement of the joint during the exercise. This included exercises for the ankle (plantar flexion, dorsiflexion, inversion, or eversion) or the digits (flexion, extension, adduction, and abduction). Exercises where more than one movement was needed were considered “multiple” (i.e., multiple movements). Exercises without movement occurring at a joint (e.g., standing still) were considered “static”.

To calculate sets per muscle group, we determined that all exercises performing a primary movement, (e.g., ankle plantar flexion or ankle inversion), would be considered one muscle group. Therefore, if a study had three ankle plantar flexion exercises where the participant performed three sets of each, it was considered nine sets for the ankle plantar flexion muscle group.

We grouped exercises by category to provide them with context relative to their intended aim. These categories included targeted movements (ankle plantar flexion, ankle dorsiflexion, ankle inversion, and ankle eversion), specific structures of interest (plantar intrinsics, hallux, and lesser digits), and the desired outcome (balance and dexterity) of the exercise. For example, resisted ankle inversion targets the movement of ankle inversion, the short foot exercise targets the specific structures of the plantar intrinsics, and scrunching digits and writing the alphabet with the foot target the outcome of improving the dexterity of the digits, foot, and ankle.

A tally of the program's training frequency (e.g., to perform the program or exercise three times a week) was documented. In some studies, different exercises in a program were performed at different frequencies, so the frequency was documented per exercise rather than per study.

The duration of the program (e.g., an 8‐week exercise program) was documented.

The intensity was also quantified as a percentage of repetition maximum (RM), and/or the raw value provided was documented. When a weight or resistance band type was provided with no context of its RM, it was only documented as the weight specified.

Load types were documented, which included any equipment that created a resistance or load for the exercise (e.g., Thera‐Band, bodyweight, and weighted bags). Where nothing was specified, “not reported” was documented.

Exercise progressions were documented and categorized as “increasing in volume only,” “increasing in load only,” “increasing in volume then load,” “increasing in load then volume,” “increasing in load and volume,” an “alternative” method that was neither load or volume, an “unspecified” method of progressing exercise, or “not reported.”

The tally of sets and repetitions prescribed for each exercise was documented independently. The repetition range (e.g., heel raises for 10 repetitions), time (e.g., inverting the ankle for 10 min), and distance (e.g., scrunching a 1‐m length of towel) were also documented.

Comparison was made to the ACSM guidelines for exercise testing and prescription, which provide recommendations for the best dosage of strengthening exercise variables (e.g., frequency, intensity, and time) to achieve strength gains in the following groups: novice, intermediate, and advanced lifters [15]. The term “lifter(s)” refers to anyone performing resistance strength training; a novice lifter is someone who has little to no experience with strength training and an advanced lifter is someone who performs strength training regularly and has years of experience [15]. The guidelines were summarized to compare each study against best practice (Table1). The summary provides the optimal number of sets per muscle group, load, or resistance relative to repetition maximum and the frequency of performing the exercise. Groups with different amounts of training experience have different recommendations for achieving optimal strength gains [15].

Best practice exercise variable dosage recommendations for muscle strength as recommended by the ACSM guidelines [15].

Note:This table outlines the recommended sets, load intensity and frequency of performing exercises for strength gains for the three levels of experience.

When comparing exercise prescription variables to the ACSM guidelines, the following structures were used. For repetitions, the prescribed dosage for each exercise was compared to the ACSM guidelines. For sets per muscle group, all exercises within each study were grouped according to primary movements (e.g., all ankle plantar flexion exercises were grouped together) and then the collective sets were compared against the ACSM guidelines. For load intensity and training frequency, the prescribed dose of each individual exercise was compared against the ACSM guidelines. Finally, every program within each study was compared to best practice recommendations to ascertain if it met all three domains of sets, recommended load intensity, and frequency.

The primary author (JWAO) assessed the quality of reporting of exercises in each study using the CERT checklist [16]. The CERT is a 16‐item checklist developed by an international panel of experts, and was designed to improve the transparency and reproducibility of exercise programs used in scientific studies [16].

The search yielded 1511 documents; after removing 62 duplicates, 1449 documents were screened by the title and abstract. Following the title and abstract review, there were 292 relevant documents, and 87 documents were included after a full‐text screening (Table2). Most studies were randomized controlled trials [2,4,8,19,22,23,24,27,29,31,32,34,35,36,37,39,40,43,44,45,46,47,51,52,53,55,56,57,58,59,60,62,63,65,66,67,69,71,72,73,74,75,77,82], followed by pre‐post intervention studies [20,26,28,38,42,49,61,64,68,70,76,84,87,90,91,95,96]. Also included were trial protocols [30,33,54,79,94], feasibility studies [80,93,101], nonrandomized controlled trials [21,41,48,78], pilot studies [50,83], case reports [25,86], and a case series [81]. Where both a protocol and a trial were available, either the protocol or trial was used for results depending on which provided more details.

Not reported in the study.

This trial had two intervention groups that were randomized and a third (control) group that was not randomized.

The mean age across studies was 39 years with a range of 18–83 years. Of the 87 studies, 38 (44%) used a general population of adults [2,10,20,23,24,25,27,30,31,32,34,35,36,38,39,40,41,42,45,46,49,52,55,56,59,62,63,64,66,70,73,76,79,80,81,100,101,103], where specific subgroups of adults were used in 49 studies, including older adults in 12 of 87 studies (14%) [4,21,37,54,58,78,82,84,85,87,89,95], females only in 5 (6%) [19,29,53,72,77] and males only [61], male sedentary adults [44], and young adults (between the ages of 18–30 years) [60] in 1 (1%) each. Twelve of 87 studies (14%) targeted athletes [22,28,33,50,65,75,83,86,91,92,93,97]; 5 (6%) included runners [28,83,91,92,93], 3 (3%) included recreational athletes [33,75,86], 2 (2%) included unspecified athletes with a previous ankle sprain [50,97], and 1 (1%) each for volleyball [65] and collegiate athletes [22]. Of the 87 studies, 7 (8%) included individuals with pes planus [43,48,51,67,71,96,102] and 6 (7%) post‐surgical patients [27,57,69,90,94,98]. Four studies (5%) recruited college or university students [26,47,88,99].

Of the 87 studies, 31 targeted healthy individuals (36% of 87 studies) [4,21,28,32,37,38,43,44,48,54,58,59,64,67,68,70,71,73,77,78,83,84,85,87,91,92,93,95,96,102]. Where specific conditions were targeted, ankle conditions were commonly chosen with 18 studies (20%) recruiting individuals with ankle instability [22,26,34,35,36,45,47,52,55,56,60,65,75,76,88,97,99,100], 5 (6%) ankle fractures [27,57,69,90,98], and 4 (5%) acute and chronic ankle injuries [23,24,41,50]. Tendinopathies were also targeted with seven studies (8%) including Achilles tendinopathy [31,33,42,62,63,74,103] and three (3%) tibialis posterior tendinopathy [40,49,81]. Eight studies (9%) provided exercise as an intervention for plantar heel pain [2,25,30,39,46,79,80,101]. Less common conditions included hallux valgus in three studies (3%) [19,53,72], falls and balance issues in two (2%) [82,94], and metatarsalgia [20], general foot pain [89], and posterior impingement [86] in one (1%) each. There were several studies that targeted more proximal conditions including patellofemoral joint pain in two studies (2%) [51,66], lower limb [29], and low back pain [61] in one (1%) each.

A total of 300 exercises were prescribed across all studies. The most common category of exercise was ankle plantar flexion exercises for 75 individual exercises (25%), followed by 50 exercises for plantar intrinsics (16%), 45 for ankle and digital dexterity (15%), and 27 for ankle dorsiflexion (9%). Ankle eversion (23, 8%) and ankle inversion exercises (22, 7%) had similar representation across all exercises prescribed. There were substantially fewer exercises targeted at the digits specifically: hallux (10, 3%) and lesser digits (1, < 1%). Other exercises included balance (15, 5%), plyometrics (3, 1%), and those classified in the other category (29, 10%) (Supporting InformationS2).

Out of the 300 exercises, the most common primary movement featured in exercises prescribed across all studies was ankle plantar flexion (84, 28%), followed by digital flexion (39, 13%), ankle dorsiflexion (34, 11%), arch lifting (32, 11%), ankle eversion (23, 8%), ankle inversion (22, 7%), and digital abduction (4, 1%). There were 14 (5%) static exercises that did not elicit a movement (i.e., balancing exercises or voluntary isometric contractions) and 44 (15%) that used multiple movements in one exercise (i.e., tracing the alphabet with the foot and ankle or curling a towel with the digits). Less common movements were digital extension (2, < 1%) and digital adduction (2, < 1%) (Supporting InformationS2).

In relation tofrequency, there was a large variation from once every hour (or hourly) to once per week. The most common frequency to perform exercises was three times per week for 101 of 300 exercises (34%), followed by daily (68 exercises, 23%), three times per day (20, 7%), five times per week (19, 6%), and two times per week (14, 5%). Other lesser prescribed frequencies included 30 min per week (9 of 300 exercises, 3%), every other day (3, 1%), once per week (4, 1%), 2 times per day (13, 4%), 2 to 3 times per day (8, 3%), 3 to 4 times per day (6, 2%), 4 times per day (2, < 1%), 4 to 5 times per day (4, 1%), hourly (2, < 1%), and a frequency was not reported 27 times (9%) (Supporting InformationS2).

In relation tointensityof load, 198 of the 300 exercises (66%) did not have any specified type of load and 13 (4%) specified no load to be used. Of the remaining 89 exercises, 12 different types of load were prescribed. The most common equipment or objects to provide resistance or load were Thera‐Band, (51 of 300 exercises, 17%), followed by bodyweight only (11, 4%), elastic tubing (8, 3%), a weighted bag (5, 2%), dumbbells (4, 1%), pin‐loaded weights (2, < 1%), ankle weights (1, < 1%), the contralateral foot (1, < 1%), furniture (1, < 1%), gel toe separators (1, < 1%), and a Pilates reformer (1, < 1%) (Supporting InformationS2).

A specified load intensity was not provided in 234 of the 300 exercises (78%). For the 66 exercises that it was provided, the load intensity, according to a participant's RM, was reported for 9 exercises (3%) [2,39,58,78,79,80,87]. Specifically, it was reported as a percentage of a 1RM for 1 exercise (< 1%) [58] or a percentage of 3RM for 2 exercises (< 1%) [87]. Alternatively, it was reported as a specified number RM without a percentage for 6 exercises (2%) [2,39,78,79,80]. Commonly, load intensity relative to an individual's RM was not reported, although a prescribed load was still provided for 56 exercises (18%). When a load intensity was prescribed not relative to a repetition maximum, the most common were red or medium Thera‐Band (23 exercises, 8%) and bodyweight (11 exercises, 3%). Other load intensities included varieties of Thera‐Band from extra heavy for seven exercises (2%) to light for two exercises (< 1%), a one to 2 kg (kg) weight for one exercise (< 1%), 3 kg weight for one exercise (< 1%), and no weight at all for six exercises (2%).

In relation toprogression, 176 of the 300 exercises (59%) used progressions. Quantifiable progressions (i.e., using a prescribed quantity of load or volume) were used in 146 exercises. When quantifiable progression was used as part of an exercise prescription, the most common method was increasing load only (81 exercises out of 300, 27%), followed by volume only (28, 9%), volume then load (23, 8%), load then volume (12, 4%), volume or load (11, 4%), and volume and load (2, < 1%). Alternative progressions, such as changing the surface people, were using or giving people a choice of progression strategy, occurred in 8 exercises (3%), and an unspecified progression strategy occurred in 11 exercises (4%). It was unclear whether the alternative and unspecified progression offered by the program contributed to a load or volume increase or required a greater skill level to complete the exercise (Supporting InformationS2).

In relation torepetitions, using a fixed number was the most common approach when prescribing exercises, which was used in 221 of the 300 exercises (74%). The most common repetition value used was 10 repetitions for 115 of 300 exercises (38%), followed by 15 repetitions (41, 14%), then 30 repetitions (19, 6%). Other repetition values included 5 (10, 3%), 8 (9, 3%), 12 (15, 5%), 20 (7, 2%), 100 (2, < 1%), and 200 (2, < 1%) repetitions. For one exercise, 26 repetitions [41] were used; this accounted for writing each letter of the alphabet once. Repetitions were not specified for 41 (13%) exercises (Supporting InformationS2).

Some studies used a repetition range instead of a fixed number. Ten to 15 repetitions were the most common range (7, 2%), followed by 5–15 (4, 1%), 5–10 (2, < 1%), and 20–25 (1, < 1%) (Supporting InformationS2). Other studies did not use a number or range, electing instead to use time or distance. The most common repetitions for time values were to perform an exercise for 10 min (8, 3%), followed by 3 min (2, < 1%), 1 min (2, < 1%), and 10 s (2, < 1%). All other timed approaches were only used once (< 1%), including 30 s, 45 s, 30–60 s, and 2, 4, 5, 6, 20, and 30 min (Supporting InformationS2). One exercise prescribed a distance or length measure of a one‐m towel for toe scrunches (Supporting InformationS2).

In relation tosets, most studies reported the number of sets for exercises. The most common number of sets prescribed per exercise was 3 sets across 110 of 300 exercises (37% of exercises), followed by a single set for 94 exercises (31%), 2 sets for 27 exercises (9%), 5 sets for 4 exercises (1%), 8 sets for 3 exercises (1%), and 4 sets for 3 exercises (1%). Ranged sets were also prescribed with ranges of two to three sets for seven exercises (2%), two to four sets for four exercises (1%), and one to three sets for two exercises (< 1%). Two studies prescribed one exercise each to be performed “as many [times] as possible” (< 1% of all exercises). Sets were not specified for 57 exercises, accounting for 19% of all prescribed exercises (Supporting InformationS2).

Firstly, we compared the training frequency of programs in the included studies to the ACSM guidelines [15] (Figure2).



Frequency to perform individual prescribed exercises. Gray color indicates not meeting recommendations, green for meeting novice lifters, and purple for intermediate to advanced.

The recommended frequency for a novice or untrained individual in the ACSM guidelines is two to 3 days per week [15]. The frequency of exercise (i.e., how often to perform them) was reported 273 times across the 300 exercises (91% of all exercises). The prescribed frequency to perform an exercise ranged from once a week to hourly. The most common frequency was 3 times a week across 101 of 300 exercises (33%), which meets the novice and untrained lifter recommendations. Recreationally trained and athletic individuals are recommended to train less frequently at 2 days per week [15]. Training 2 times per week was prescribed for 14 of the 300 exercises (5%) and for once a week for 4 exercises (1%). Other frequencies prescribed per exercise of the 300 exercises included daily (69 of 300 exercises, 23%), not specified (27, 9%), 3 times a day (20, 6%), and 5 times a week (19, 6%). Aside from “not specified,” all of these prescriptions were more than any of the recommendations in the ACSM guidelines.

Secondly, we compared the intensity of load prescribed in the studies included in this review to the recommendations provided by the ACSM guidelines [15] (Figure3).



Load intensity of individual prescribed exercises. Gray color indicates not meeting recommendations, green for meeting novice lifters, and purple for intermediate to advanced.

The guidelines report all load intensity according to a RM, as it provides a valid and consistent reference point for determining load intensity for an individual [104,105]. The recommended load intensity for a novice or untrained lifter is 60%–70% of a 1RM (60%–70% 1RM) or 8 to 12RM [15]. None of the 87 studies included in this review reported a percentage of loading between 60% and 70% 1RM. However, an 8RM load intensity was reported for 5 of the 300 exercises (2%) [2,78,79,80] and 1 study reported a 10RM for 1 exercise [39]. This load intensity would meet recommendations for novice lifters. One exercise was prescribed at 50%–60% of 1RM [58], and 2 were prescribed at 50%–55% of 3RM [87]; both are less than the recommendation for a novice lifter. The recommended load intensity for intermediate and advanced lifters is between 80% and 100% 1RM [15], which was not met in any study or for any exercise.

Thirdly, the number of sets per muscle group prescribed in the studies included in this review was compared to the recommendations for strength training in the ACSM guidelines [15] (Figure4).



Sets per muscle group across all prescribed exercises. Gray color indicates not meeting recommendations, green for meeting novice lifters, and purple for intermediate to advanced.

To achieve optimal strength gains, the guidelines outline sets per muscle group and not per exercise. For this review, the muscle group was defined as a primary movement (e.g., plantar flexion and ankle inversion). According to the ACSM guidelines, the recommended number of sets per muscle group for novice lifters is between one and three [15]. In 28 of the 87 studies included in this review (32%), one set of exercises per muscle group was prescribed [4,20,27,29,30,37,41,48,51,53,57,59,60,61,64,66,67,68,73,77,89,91,92,93,94,98,100,102]. In 16 studies (18%), 2 sets per muscle group were prescribed [4,30,35,38,41,49,53,58,66,75,77,82,92,93,97,103]. The largest prescription per muscle group was 3 sets per muscle group, which was prescribed in 40 studies (46%) [2,21,22,25,32,34,35,39,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,50,52,54,56,57,62,63,65,66,70,71,75,76,78,84,85,88,89,92,93,95,96,99,101,103]. For more experienced lifters, the ACSM guidelines recommend “multiple sets to be used with systematic variation of volume and intensity over time.” Of the 87 studies, 4 sets or more per muscle group were prescribed in 21 studies (30%) [4,19,20,21,28,30,31,33,34,36,40,41,49,55,66,74,86,87,89,95,97] with the number of sets ranging from 4 to 16. Of the 26 studies providing 4 or more sets, 4 of those studies specify athletes (i.e., advanced lifters) as participants [28,33,86,97]. No specific sets were specified for 35 primary movements across 10 of the 87 studies (11%) [23,24,26,69,72,79,80,81,83,90], with 2 of these studies prescribing “as many sets as possible,” which could achieve the recommendations for novice, intermediate, or advanced lifters [79,80].

Finally, we assessed each program to assess how many met all recommendations for frequency, intensity, and time. For novice or untrained lifters, this would equate to 1 to 3 sets, at 60%–70% of a 1RM, 3 times per week. This was met in 5 of 87 studies (6%) [2,39,78,79,80]. For the intermediate or advanced lifter, this would equate to greater than 3 sets (as an increase in volume and intensity from a novice), at 80% or more of 1RM, 2 to 3 times a week. No programs met these recommendations.

Of the 87 studies, the number of items reported on the CERT ranged from 1 to 15 (out of a maximum of 16). The median CERT score of all included studies was 5, equating to only 31% of the items on this checklist. Eighty‐three of the 87 studies (95%) provided a “detailed description of the exercise intervention including, but not limited to, number of exercise repetitions/sets/sessions, session duration, intervention/program duration, etc” [2,4,6,19,20,21,22,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60], 63 studies (72%) provided “detailed description of the type of exercise equipment (e.g., weights, exercise equipment such as machines, treadmill, and bicycle ergometer)” [2,4,7,21,23,24,26,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,39,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,54,58,59,61,62,63,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,76], and 58 (66%) provided a “detailed description of the decision rule(s) for determining exercise progression and a detailed description of how the exercise program was progressed” [2,4,8,21,23,25,26,33,34,35,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,51,52,54,55,56,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,68,69,70,73,75,77,78,79,80]. A “detailed description of any home program component (e.g., other exercises, and stretching)” was reported in 18 studies (24%) [23,29,33,34,37,57,61,63,66,67,69,74,79,84,87,92,93,95] and a description of “whether there are any nonexercise components (e.g., education, cognitive–behavioral therapy, and massage,)” was reported in 8 studies (9%) [2,4,33,37,57,79,80,87]. Seven studies (8%) provided sufficient information for the item “detailed description of motivation strategies” [2,41,42,79,80,92,93], “describe the type and number of adverse events that occurred during exercise” [4,30,42,57,58,79,80], and for “describe the decision rule for determining the starting level at which people commence an exercise program (such as beginner, intermediate, advanced, etc)” [2,30,70,79,80,82,85]. Sufficient information was provided for the item “Describe whether the exercises are generic (one size fits all) or tailored to the individual and detailed description of how exercises are tailored to the individual” in 20 studies (23%) [2,4,23,30,32,45,46,49,50,58,63,66,70,78,79,80,86,89,92,93] and “how adherence or fidelity to the exercise intervention is assessed/measured and the extent to which the intervention was delivered as planned” in 17 studies (20%) [2,21,29,30,32,34,43,45,46,47,49,50,71,74,79,80,91]. No studies fulfilled all criteria (Supporting InformationS3).

Foot and ankle muscle strengthening exercises are a common intervention. They can be used for healthy populations to maintain adequate strength, although they are often prescribed by clinicians for managing lower limb musculoskeletal conditions [93,106]. Our review set out to describe and critique the exercises outlined in the literature. Specifically, we aimed to (i) describe what foot and ankle strengthening exercises have been recommended in the scientific literature, (ii) compare these exercise prescriptions to the ACSM guidelines for prescription of strengthening exercises, and (iii) assess the completeness of the reporting of these exercises and exercise programs using the CERT.

For the studies included in our review, the ankle was the most commonly targeted region for strengthening exercises at the foot and ankle. Ankle plantar flexion exercises comprised 25% of the total exercises and were the most frequently prescribed exercise category and primary movement. This may be partly due to most conditions being related to ankle pathology. However, more than one third of the samples included healthy adults, demonstrating that most foot and ankle muscle strengthening programs, regardless of pathology, emphasize enhancing ankle plantar flexion movements. In addition, there was a high frequency of prescription of plantar intrinsic exercises, highlighting the significance attributed to intrinsic foot musculature. Interestingly, a relatively large percentage (15%) of dexterity exercises were prescribed, such as ankle alphabet (an exercise tracing letters using the ankle as the primary mover) and toe yoga (exercises using the digits to move independently of one another).

Forloading intensityof strengthening exercises, studies used various types of resistance equipment, but red medium‐strength resistance bands (such as Thera‐Band) were found to be the most frequently used. Interestingly, while the use of resistance bands was a common method to provide resistance, no specified resistance or no resistance at all was used for most exercises. Achieving maximal strength gains requires adequate load intensity to stimulate change [10]. Inadequate load intensity has the capacity to not provide adequate stimulus to facilitate gains in strength [8,107]. Prescribing inadequate loads is a consistent theme in this scoping review.

Exercise progression was incorporated into the majority of foot and ankle strengthening programs. This highlights that the investigators of the studies included in our review acknowledged that strengthening exercises require progression to achieve the best possible gains. This approach also aligns with the fundamentals of strength training and the recommendations outlined in the ACSM guidelines [15]. Most programs opted to increase load before increasing the volume, which is consistent with the ACSM recommendations that suggest increasing loads by 2%–10% for smaller muscle exercises (such as at the foot and ankle) when an individual can perform 2 or more repetitions beyond the initial prescription without reaching fatigue [15]. While load before volume may have been the most common, there was a large variety of approaches used to progress exercises across all studies, including increasing the perceived skill difficulty of an exercise and leaving the progression to a practitioner's discretion. Accordingly, further refinement and understanding of the effects of foot and ankle strength training exercise selection and prescription protocols on foot and ankle musculature should be a priority for future research.

Fortime, a diversity of approaches was used, but fixed repetition was by far the most common prescription method. Sets and repetitions were often prescribed as 3 sets of 10 repetitions per exercise. However, this prescription is a 'one size fits all’ or generic approach and may not consider strength training fundamentals such as specificity or variation for optimum benefits at the foot and ankle [105]. Furthermore, like all strength training protocols, this prescription structure was designed for training the entire body (including large muscle groups such as the hips or chest) and has been adapted for use with proximal structures rather than being specifically designed for achieving maximal strength gains at the foot and ankle.

The ACSM guidelines have established dosage recommendations for strengthening exercise prescriptions across different populations [15]. For novice lifters (with some mild reduction in volume for certain older populations), it is recommended that optimal strength gains occur when training 4 sets per muscle group (or primary movement), using 60%–70% 1RM with 2–3 training sessions per week [8,9,10,15]. For intermediate and advanced lifters, higher load intensity and an increase in training volume are recommended for increased strength gains with the ACSM recommending advanced individuals cycle loads of 80% 1RM or greater [15]. These recommendations are supported by several meta‐analyses to estimate the optimal number of sets and load intensity for beginners, the recreationally trained, and athletes to achieve strength gains [8,9,10].

The prescription of training frequency, in the studies included in our review, often exceeds best practice recommendations, with some exercises prescribed excessively (e.g., hourly and daily) compared to the ACSM guidelines of three times per week for a novice and less than that for advanced lifters [15]. While frequency may impact strength gains less than load intensity or set volume, adequate recovery time is an important programming consideration for strength adaption [108]. Increasing frequency must always be viewed in the context of the collective volume of load intensity, sets, and exercise selection [15]. Although occasionally, high frequency training might be beneficial, several meta‐analyses have shown that the highest yield of strength gains occurs at two times per week for advanced individuals [8,10].

Regarding load intensity, higher loads are needed to achieve optimal strength gains compared to hypertrophy or muscular endurance [8,11]. However, load intensity, in relation to a RM, was only reported in 3% of exercises in our review. Repetition maximum is not only a valid measure to determine an individual's strength capacity, but also the most appropriate method to determine the prescription of load intensity for that individual [109,110,111]. There may be some balance exercises (e.g., single leg balance) where it is difficult to determine a load based on RM, but balance exercises only accounted for 5% of the exercises included in our review. When loads were reported, they rarely met the ACSM guidelines, with 2% of exercises reporting a load intensity that would be considered acceptable for novices or for more frail populations aged over 65 years (i.e., between 60% and 80% 1RM) and none meeting recommendations for intermediate or advanced lifters (i.e., 80% RM or greater) [15]. Moreover, load intensity was infrequently reported. Load was not reported in 76% of exercises; although we cannot be certain, some possibly used bodyweight only. If this was the case, these exercises may have been under‐loaded (or over‐loaded) to optimize for strength gains compared to the recommendations outlined by the ACSM guidelines. Furthermore, many exercises provided resistance bands and weights under 3 kg, which could also represent loads that do not meet recommendations. As the ankle joint complex can produce a force up to five times an individual's body weight during running, this amount of load is likely to be inadequate [112]. Future studies could avoid this by prescribing loads as a percentage of RM at an appropriate load intensity, as suboptimal loads will not lead to maximal strength gains.

Most programs met the set volume recommendations for novice lifters, with 62% prescribing between 1 and 3 sets per muscle group. Considerably, fewer studies included programs with four or more sets. The investigators concluded that athletes (advanced lifters) should consider increases in volume up to eight sets per muscle group to achieve optimal strength gains [8,9,10]. This is a significant increase in volume when compared with the recommendations for novice lifters [8,9,10], but is consistent with the recommendations set by the ACSM guidelines [15]. However, of the 12 studies that recruited athletes included in our review, only 2 prescribed 8 or more sets for a primary movement [28,86]. Therefore, in the majority of studies, the advanced lifter or athletic population was prescribed inadequate volume to optimize strength gains. Regarding the 12 studies designed for the older populations, the prescriptions were between 1 and 6 sets per muscle group, which is consistent with all the other studies aimed at healthy adults that ranged from insufficient to more than recommended for older or more frail populations [15]. There is an opportunity that researchers consider prescribing a greater volume of sets per primary movement to optimize outcomes for strength gains, especially if targeting athletic populations. This may also be the case for clinicians if they are basing their prescriptions on current scientific literature, that is, the studies included in our review.

Finally, only 5% of the studies met all ACSM recommendations for a training program for novice lifters in relation to sets, load intensity, and frequency. These programs prescribed 3 sets per primary movement (plantar flexion), with loads of 8 to 10RM, performed 3 times per week [1,2,3,4,5]. By meeting the needs of novice lifters, these recommendations may better represent the requirements of the general population. However, the small percentage of studies meeting these guidelines highlights that most foot and ankle strengthening programs in the studies included in our review did not meet recommendations for optimal strength gains.

Overall, while all strength training yields positive outcomes, adherence to best practice principles can optimize strength gains [10,11]. Discrepancies between what was prescribed in the studies included in our review and best practice suggest that more tailored and informed strengthening programs should be used for the foot and ankle to optimize strength gains, with a focus on increasing load intensity (i.e., % RM) as the priority.

As previously found [12,13,14], exercises were generally poorly reported. We found that nearly all studies included in our review reported a name for each exercise. In more than half of the studies, the names of exercises were synonymous with how the exercises are performed. However, many of the exercises were difficult to understand due to the complexity of the description. For example, the “short foot exercise” is challenging to explain and demonstrate. Indeed, due to its complexity, this exercise also is also referred to by other names, including “doming” and “plantar arch raise,” and the descriptions of how to perform the exercise also varies widely. Certainly, many exercise names do not create a clear understanding of how to perform the exercise. This raises the question of whether simply providing a name or description of the exercise is sufficient. Supporting images and videos of how an exercise is performed would be helpful, which has previously been suggested by Christensen et al. [12]. A package of information that includes consistent naming and descriptions of specific exercises that also has accompanying audio and/or visual information would likely provide optimal information for an individual to successfully perform the exercises. While this would be worthwhile for patients, it would also be helpful to improve consistency and repeatability in research.

The establishment of a tailored approach to an exercise program was generally under reported. When considering a tailored approach, future studies may consider tailoring prescription variables to individuals' capacity using a % of RM rather than giving everyone the same prescribed load (i.e., 3 kg or medium Thera‐Band). Such an approach would allow for each program to be adequately tailored for each participant, according to their capacity or pain levels. It would also be easier for clinicians to translate the program into practice and would provide some basis to determine if the program requires modification based on a patient's level of discomfort. This could easily be achieved by determining a participant's RM for any given weight at the start of the program and provide an adapted weight relative to the participant's %RM prescribed. Further, this RM method can be translated to different equipment, from Thera‐Bands to dumbbells, and is not a new concept to strength and conditioning literature. The authors acknowledge that the RM method has only been established for bench press, squat, and deadlift, but it has not yet been established for foot and ankle exercises [111]. Nonetheless, the principle can still be applied to the foot and ankle until more research is conducted. Based on this, the resistance (or load) can be tailored for an individual's capacity (i.e., use more or less resistance or load), and doing so, increases the likelihood that the prescription, including the progression of load, is optimized to achieve strength gains.

When considering conditions of the foot and ankle such as plantar heel pain and tendinopathies, everyday walking and other loads contribute to the cumulative load on tissues [113]. Therefore, the inclusion of the reporting item “whether there are any home program” or “nonexercise components” is useful in understanding the overall loads to which participants are subjected. These items are important as additional loads, outside of those applied in a strength training program, may negatively influence pain and function [114]. Accordingly, we recommend that future studies include a statement about how much incidental exercise or other loading exercises may or may not be included to provide a more complete indication of the entire loading regime.

With the above in mind, our findings indicate that future research offering strength training as an intervention should include detailed descriptions (with online video instructions likely being even more effective), including dosage of exercises and programs for completeness, transparency, and optimal benefit.

There are several strengths of our review, which collated 87 studies and 300 exercises to summarize the literature of foot and ankle strengthening exercises. The review includes studies from various countries and covers a range of conditions, providing a broad perspective on what is currently being prescribed. It also compared their exercise prescriptions to best practice guidelines and evaluated the reporting of these exercises. We believe this is the first review of this kind to be published.

However, our review has a number of limitations that need to be considered. The authors acknowledge that only two databases have been searched, and relevant studies may have been missed. However, to account for this, hand searching of reference lists, gray literature, and studies included in systematic reviews was performed.

Only one author performed all screening and data extraction of included articles and data. Additional reviewers would have improved the rigor of the search, screening and data extraction process. Future reviews should consider two or more reviewers to screen and extract data.

Exercise prescription is complex and can include many variables that were not assessed in our review (e.g., rest, time between sets, and exercise tempo). Instead, we sought to focus on the key variables of sets, repetitions, and frequency as they are common prescription variables used by researchers and clinicians.

The ACSM best practice guidelines were developed for the whole body and were not specific to the foot and ankle. Understanding the impact of exercise choice and its prescription variables (sets, loading magnitude, and training frequency) on the foot and ankle specifically would be beneficial.

A recommendation of our review is to use the CERT as a method for reporting exercise, which aligns with previous research [13,14]. However, we are aware that one study [12] has suggested that the CERT lacks enough specific details to allow adequate translation to clinical practice.

Finally, the ACSM guidelines and CERT checklist were published after many of the studies in our review were conducted, so the low adherence to these was not unexpected.

This review found that prescriptions of foot and ankle muscle strengthening exercises predominantly recommend exercises targeted at the ankle plantar flexion and intrinsic muscles, typically prescribed at 3 sets of 10 repetitions 3 times a week, often using no prescribed load. In addition, foot and ankle exercise programs do not provide adequate load intensity to maximize strength gains when compared to recommendations from the ACSM. There are also substantial deficiencies in the reporting of foot and ankle exercises, making them difficult to understand and implement. We suggest adopting established best practice recommendations like the ACSM guidelines for exercise testing and prescription and the CERT for improved exercise reporting.

Children are more likely than adults to explore new options, but is this due to a top‐down epistemic‐uncertainty‐driven process or a bottom‐up novelty‐driven process? Given immature cognitive control, children may choose a new option because they are more susceptible to the automatic attraction of perceptual novelty and have difficulty disengaging from it. This hypothesis is difficult to test because perceptual novelty is intertwined with epistemic uncertainty. To address this problem, we designed a new n‐armed bandit task to fully decouple novelty and epistemic uncertainty. By having adults and 4‐ to 6‐year‐olds perform the task, we found that perceptual novelty predominated 4‐year‐olds’ (but not adults’ or older children's) decisions even when it had no epistemic uncertainty and had the lowest reward value. Additionally, 4‐year‐olds showed such a novelty preference only when the option's novelty was directly observable, but not when it could only be anticipated, providing new evidence that perceptual novelty alone can drive elevated exploration in early development in a bottom‐up manner.

Keywords:cognitive development, computational modeling, decision‐making, exploration‐exploitation dilemma, stimulus‐driven attention

When choosing between the tried and true and the novel, young children (particularly preschoolers) are more likely than adults to explore the novel option. For example, when choosing a bet in a multi‐arm bandit, adults tend to exploit the most rewarding option, whereas young children are more likely to explore novel options (Blanco and Sloutsky2020,2021; Cockburn et al.2022; Dubois et al.2022; Nussenbaum et al.2023; E. Schulz et al.2018). Prior research has suggested that young children's heightened exploration arises from greater curiosity—an intrinsic drive to gather information.

Due to immature attentional systems, children's novelty‐driven decisions may result from their susceptibility to automatic attentional capture by perceptual novelty.

One barrier to examining this hypothesis is that perceptual novelty is intertwined with epistemic uncertainty, making it challenging to investigate its independent effects.

To examine whether perceptual novelty alone is sufficient to drive early exploration, we adopted a new paradigm to fully decouple perceptual novelty and epistemic uncertainty.

The results demonstrated that perceptual novelty alone could drive elevated exploration in early development, presumably in a bottom‐up manner.

Specifically, curiosity may drive people to glean information that is new, uncertain, and potentially valuable to them (Berlyne1954; Blanco and Sloutsky2021; Liquin, Callaway, and Lombrozo2021; Molinaro et al.2023; Poli et al.2020,2022; Ruggeri et al.2024; Wilson et al.2021). Given that childhood is a special period characterized by resource abundance (due to parental care), limited knowledge, and an expanded temporal horizon for learning, it is both natural and beneficial for young children to prioritize information‐seeking (exploration) over utilizing their current knowledge to maximize rewards (exploitation).

However, findings on young children's information‐driven exploration are mixed. Some research found that young children displayed higher levels ofsystematicexploration (explore to gain information and reduce uncertainty) compared to adults (Blanco and Sloutsky2021; Giron et al.2023; Gopnik2020; Poli et al.2024; Ruggeri et al.2024; Schulz et al.2018). However, other research found that young children continued to sample information when there was no information to gain (Ruggeri et al.2016; Wan and Sloutsky2024), indicating that information‐seeking is not the only driver of children's choices.

Moreover, even when found, young children's systematic exploration is unlikely to begoal‐directedandinformation‐driven. This is because if young children's exploration is driven by their quest for information, they should be able to estimate their own state of knowledge and the potential information gain, the estimation requiring the levels of metacognitive abilities that they may not be capable of (Coughlin et al.2015; Hembacher and Ghetti2014; Kim, Berry, and Carlson2025; Lockl and Schneider2004; Niebaum et al.2021; O'Leary and Sloutsky2017,2019; Schulz et al.2023). More importantly, the fact that making one option perceptually salient could disrupt young children's exploration (Blanco and Sloutsky2020) suggests that such exploration may not be goal‐directed. These findings suggest that a potentially stimulus‐driven attention mechanism, rather than the intrinsic value of information, may underlie young children's exploration.

Following up on this idea, we propose that young children's elevated exploration can result from the interaction between a bottom‐up novelty effect and immature cognitive control. Specifically, early in development, perceptually novel stimuli can automatically capture attention, with cognitive control not being mature enough to inhibit or disengage this attentional capture. The primary goal of the paper is to test this hypothesis. However, although this hypothesis presents a compelling framework for understanding heightened exploration in early development, as we explain below, testing it is quite challenging. In what follows, we will first discuss how perceptual novelty can drive children's exploration in a bottom‐up manner. We then identify critical challenges in testing this hypothesis and provide an overview of how our approach meets this challenge.

Human attention can be controlled in a top‐down way that is initiated voluntarily and based on task demands and agents’ goals, or in a bottom‐up way that is automatically triggered by stimulus properties (Theeuwes2005). It is broadly recognized that stimuli that are distinct from surrounding ones (e.g., a red circle among green circles) and/or violate expectations can automatically capture people's attention in a bottom‐up manner (Fecteau and Munoz2006; Horstmann and Herwig2016; Theeuwes2005).

Perceptual novelty, with its inherent contrast to familiarity and expectations, has been shown to automatically capture attention (Hillstrom and Yantis1994; Horstmann2002; Horstmann and Herwig2016; Neo and Chua2006; Ranganath and Rainer2003; Retell et al.2016). When involuntary attention to task‐irrelevant stimuli is counterproductive (e.g., leading to poor decision‐making), adults with mature cognitive control, can inhibit automatic reactions to such stimuli and redirect attention to task‐relevant stimuli (Gaspelin et al.2015). However, young children, with immature cognitive control, are more susceptible to the attraction of novel stimuli (Turoman et al.2021) and have more difficulty suppressing spontaneous responses to such stimuli and disengaging attention from them (Schul et al.2003; Wetzel et al.2009).

Previous studies have provided initial evidence that the exploratory behaviors of people with immature or impaired cognitive control can be driven by stimulus perceptual novelty. For example, introducing a highly salient novel option disrupted young children's systematic exploration (Blanco and Sloutsky2020). In addition, populations with impulse control problems, such as those with ADHD or Parkinson's disease exhibiting impulsive compulsive behaviors, were more prone to choose novel options regardless of rewards (Djamshidian et al.2011; Sethi et al.2018). These studies highlighted an association between attention and novelty‐driven exploration, implying that novelty can impact decision‐making in a bottom‐up way when top‐down cognitive control is less effective.

One significant challenge in examining the effects of perceptual novelty is that perceptual novelty is intertwined with epistemic uncertainty. Epistemic uncertainty, in contrast with objective uncertainty that refers to the variability or unpredictability of the outcomes, results from people's lack of knowledge about an outcome. The distinction is important because objective uncertainty cannot be fully resolved by gathering information (e.g., repeatedly rolling a die won't improve the prediction of the next roll), whereas epistemic uncertainty can (e.g., reading a fiction novel to discover its ending).

Previous research has tried to tease apart novelty and epistemic uncertainty and provided initial evidence that novelty has dissociable impacts from uncertainty (Blanco and Sloutsky2021; Brown et al.2022; Cockburn et al.2022; Costa et al.2014; Dubois et al.2022; Houillon et al.2013; Nussenbaum et al.2023; Poli et al.2022; Wittmann et al.2008). However, despite substantial progress, novelty and epistemic uncertainty have not been fully decoupled. For example, many prior studies examined the effects of novelty by comparing participants’ choice decisions between novel and familiar options. However, when a novel option is introduced, it by definition carries epistemic uncertainty because its attributes are unknown (e.g., Cockburn et al.2022; Dubois et al.2022; Wittmann et al.2008). Alternatively, if novelty is construed as the infrequency of encounters rather than the initial encounter, such a construal might underestimate the impact of novelty (Blanco and Sloutsky2020; Nussenbaum et al.2023; Poli et al.2022).

As a result, it remains unclear whether (a) perceptual novelty, independent of epistemic uncertainty, can drive exploration in early development by automatically capturing attention or (b) children explore novel options because of their epistemic uncertainty. This distinction is consequential because it points to drastically different mechanisms underlying exploration: a bottom‐up novelty‐driven process versus a top‐down uncertainty‐driven process. The goal of the present research is to address this issue.

To achieve this goal, we introduce a new paradigm that disentangles novelty and epistemic uncertainty, thus allowing us to examine whether perceptual novelty without epistemic uncertainty is sufficient to drive exploration in early development.

The current study consisted of two experiments in which participants (4‐to‐6‐year‐old children and adults) chose from multiple options, each yielding different rewards and having different latent properties (i.e., uncertainty, novelty). Computational models were developed to evaluate the factors driving participants’ decisions.

Experiment 1 was conducted to examine (1) whether the paradigm used in our study replicates the exploratory patterns previously observed in young children, and (2) whether young children prioritize rewards when novelty and uncertainty are absent. This is important to rule out the possibility that novelty‐driven decisions found in our study were due to children's misunderstanding of the task and/or their insensitivity to task‐defined rewards.

Building on the initial evidence of children's novelty‐driven decisions in Experiment 1, we conducted Experiment 2 to fully decouple epistemic uncertainty and perceptual novelty as potential drivers of young children's exploratory behaviors. Experiment 2 provided novel evidence for the influence of perceptual novelty independent of any sources of uncertainty.

Moreover, to further examine potential mechanisms of novelty‐driven decisions, we introduced a distinction between observed and anticipated perceptual novelty: whereas the former is experienced directly, the latter is not. For example, perceptual novelty is experienced directly when people can observe it, such as when they see a new toy. In contrast, novelty issignaled(i.e., predicted or anticipated), when a distinct symbol (e.g., a red triangle) indicates that the toy is novel, without the toy being visible. If novelty influences exploration‐related decisions in a goal‐directed manner, then both directly experienced and anticipated novelty of an option should motivate participants to explore it. By contrast, if novelty drives exploration in a bottom‐up (i.e., stimulus‐driven) manner, then directly experienced novelty should be a substantially stronger driver of exploration. To foreshadow the results, we found that perceptual novelty drives children's choices in a bottom‐up manner.

Experiment 1 included 30, 4‐year‐olds (Mage= 4.48 years,SDage= 0.29, 13 girls), 32, 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds (Mage= 5.60 years,SDage= 0.54, 17 girls), and 32 adults (Mage= 25.49 years,SDage= 11.37, 26 females). Children of these ages were selected because 4‐year‐olds have immature cognitive control, with 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds exhibiting substantial developmental improvements (Deng and Sloutsky2015,2016; Ikeda et al.2014; Plebanek and Sloutsky2019; Van ’T Wout et al.2019).

The sample size was determined based on a prior study with a similar experimental design (Blanco and Sloutsky2020), which found age differences between 4‐ and 5‐year‐olds and adults in selecting a perceptually different and uncertain option with the lowest value and reported an effect size of 𝑑 = 1.24. The power (1−𝛽) to detect such an effect withN= 30 for each group at 0.05 significance level (𝛼) is 0.997. Therefore, we recruitedN= 30 participants for each age group.

For both experiments, adult participants were undergraduate students at Ohio State University who participated in research for course credit. Child participants were recruited from the Columbus metropolitan area. The study was approved by the Ohio State University Institutional Review Board, and informed consent was obtained from all adult participants and from the parents of child participants before their participation.

In Experiment 1, stimuli included 63 distinct pixel art images of cartoon animals from Pinterest. These pictures were presented on different colored squares on each trial, and each unique pair of an animal image and a colored square formed an “option” in the experiment.

Experiment 1 contained a training phase followed by a testing phase (30 trials for each phase). Both phases employed a simplified n‐armed bandit task in which participants collected rewards (framed as gold coins) from one of multiple options. In the training phase, participants chose among three options, and in testing, a fourth option was introduced. Each option was placed in the same location throughout the experiment.

The reward value associated with each option on each trial was initially drawn from its predetermined value distribution and rounded to the nearest whole number. Then, values exceeding a predetermined upper bound or falling below a predetermined lower bound were adjusted to the boundaries. The simulated reward distributions for all the options are shown in FigureS1. Based on the value distribution, the three training options were referred to as the high‐reward option (µ= 20,σ= 1, lower bound = 18, upper bound = 22), high‐uncertainty option (µ= 11,σ= 10, lower bound = 0, upper bound = 22), and low‐all option (µ= 2, σ = 1, lower bound = 0, upper bound = 4). Importantly, during training, the reward values carried no epistemic uncertainty, as the reward value for each option was shown on every trial, prior to the participant making their choice. The three training options were designated as “familiar” (or familiarized), so that the associated animal images and colored squares remained the same throughout the experiment.

In testing, in addition to the three options above, a high‐novelty option (µ= 11,σ= 10, lower bound = 0, upper bound = 22) was introduced. The presented animal and colored square for the high‐novelty option were different on each trial (as shown in Figure1, top‐right), with a changing color providing directly experienced perceptual novelty. In addition, the amount of information provided differed between training and testing. As mentioned above, during training, participants saw the number of rewards, colored squares, and animal images for all options on each trial. However, in testing, only the colored squares were displayed, with reward values and animal pictures hidden from participants. Because the colored square for the high‐novelty option was different on each testing trial but remained unchanged for the other three options, only the high‐novelty option had elevated perceptual novelty.



Example trials and feedback for training (left) and testing (right) phases in the child version of Experiment 1 (top) and Experiment 2 (bottom). During training (the left column), in both experiments, the reward information (i.e., the number of coins shown below animal figures and colored squares) was directly shown to participants before they made a choice. By contrast, the reward information was concealed during testing (the right column) and was shown for the chosen option after the participants made their choices. In each quadrant, the sequence represents the choice followed by the feedback screen. In the figure, the blue‐chinchilla, green‐alpaca, yellow‐panda, and pink (or other colors)‐different‐animal combinations denote the high‐reward, high‐uncertainty, low‐all, and high‐novelty options (the labels above options were added to help with the understanding of the task for readers, but were not shown to participants during the experiments). In the real experiments, however, except that the high‐novelty option was always presented on the rightmost in Experiment 1, the colors, animals, and locations of all other options were randomized for each participant.

In both phases, participants were asked to maximize rewards (the total number of coins collected). They received feedback after making choices. During the feedback, the number of rewards, the colored square, and the animal image associated with the chosen option were all displayed on the screen.

The procedure was similar for adults and children, with several differences introduced to help children better understand the instructions and be more engaged with the task. Detailed procedural differences between adults and children are described inSupplemental Materials.

After the completion of the task, two follow‐up memory questions were administered to children, asking them to point to the option that always gave them a lot of coins (high‐reward question), and the option that showed them a different animal friend on every trial (high‐novelty question).

The primary goal of computational modeling was to examine the differential impacts of option attributes on children's and adults’ choice decisions. We assumed that participants’ choices in the current task could be influenced by (expected) reward values, reward variability, perceptual novelty, and choice lag. Choice lag tracked the time elapsed since the option was last selected, capturing participants’ lag‐based switching exploration pattern. Lag‐based switching exploration patterns could reflect participants’ anti‐preservation bias or indicate epistemic‐uncertainty‐driven exploration, with longer lag times resulting in greater epistemic uncertainty of an option on a given trial (Blanco et al.2023; Blanco and Sloutsky2020,2021). However, given that Experiment 1 was unable to differentiate these two interpretations and that option rewards were directly shown to participants only in training but not testing (thus probably requiring different interpretations), we chose to not over‐interpret this parameter. Instead, we treated it as an indicator of one type of exploration pattern.

By incorporating the impacts of all choice attributes, each optioni’s relative utility on trialt(Vi,t), is calculated by Equations (1a) and (1b) in the training phase for Experiments 1 and 2, respectively:

and calculated by Equation (2) in the testing phase for both experiments:

In training,Vi,tis determined by each option's observed reward value (Ri,t), choice lag (Li,t), and expected objective uncertainty (indexed by standard deviation, σi,t) in Experiment 1, and reward value, choice lag, expected objective uncertainty, and perceptual novelty in Experiment 2 (δ[i=novel]= 1, for high‐novelty option, and δ[i=novel]= 0, for other options). In testing,Vi,tis determined by each option's expected reward value (μi,t′), choice lag, expected objective uncertainty, and perceptual novelty.

Specifically,wv_train,wl_train,wu_train,wn_trainare free parameters that represent the relative weights of reward value, choice lag, expected objective uncertainty, and perceptual novelty in the training phase. Similarly,wv_test,wl_test,wu_test,wn_testare relative weights of expected reward values, choice lag, expected objective uncertainty, and novelty in the testing phase. All the weights take values between 0 and 1, and weights contributing to the same relative utility calculation sum to 1. Min‐max normalization was applied toRi,t, µi,t, and σi,tat the trial level, and toLi,tat the phase level.

The relative utilities are then mapped onto choice probabilities by the following softmax function:

whereP(i,t) is the probability of choosing optionion trialt, and γ > 0 is the inverse temperature parameter that reflects the randomness of individuals’ exploration, with lower γ indicating more random exploration.

Moreover, given that the reward distributions were unknown to the participants, we assumed that participants updated their beliefs about the mean and variance of each reward distribution as they accumulated evidence either through direct observation (in training) or through their choices (in testing), with the mean and variance of each option not reset between training and testing. Accordingly, the model adopted a Bayesian updating mechanism for learning mean reward values and their variance (Dearden et al.1998). Technical details of the Bayesian updating mechanism were provided in theSupplemental Materials.

Preliminary analysis evaluated the accuracy of children's recognition of the high‐reward and high‐novelty options. Binomial tests were conducted to determine if children's correct responses to the high‐reward and high‐novelty memory questions were significantly above the chance level of 0.25. Detailed binomial test results are reported in TableS2. Importantly, we reported above‐chance accurate memory for high‐reward and high‐novelty options in both child age groups (ps < 0.003), indicating that children as a group, reliably identified the two options.

Participants' choice proportions in training (left panel) and testing (right panel) in Experiment 1 are presented in Figure2. As shown in the figure, all age groups exhibited a predominant preference for the high‐reward option in training, indicating that participants understood the task and maximized rewards in the absence of epistemic uncertainty or novelty. However, remarkable age‐related differences emerged during the testing phase. We focus on age differences in value‐based and novelty‐based decisions by analyzing the choice patterns of 4‐year‐olds, 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds, and adults (all other contrasts can be seen in Figure2). Specifically, we conducted one‐way ANOVAs to compare proportions of choosing the high‐reward Option by age in both phases and the high‐novelty option in the testing phase1.



The proportion of choosing different options during the training (left) and testing (right) phase for 4‐year‐olds, 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds, and adults in Experiment 1. For this and all the boxplots in the paper, boxes represent the interquartile range (IQR) of data points, with lines within each box representing the median value. The whiskers extend from each box to the furthest data point that is within 1.5 times the IQR away from the box. Dots represent individual participants. Darker dots represent that more people share the same value. Statistical significance is annotated asp< 0.05 (*),p< 0.01 (**), andp< 0.001 (***).

The results for training revealed a significant main effect of age for the high‐reward option,F(2, 91) = 18.68,p< 0.001,ηp2= 0.29. According to post hoc analysis with Tukey's HSD Test, adults (Madults= 0.83,SDadults= 0.12) were more likely to choose the high‐reward option compared to both age groups of children (M4yo= 0.58,SD4yo= 0.20;M5 − 6yo= 0.65,SD5 − 6yo= 0.16),ps < 0.001, with no significant difference between the two child groups,p= 0.193.

As for testing, the results revealed a significant main effect of age for both high‐reward,F(2, 91) = 47.29,p< 0.001,ηp2= 0.51, and high‐novelty:F(2, 91) = 33.27,p< 0.001,ηp2= 0.42. Adults were more likely to choose the high‐reward option (Madults= 0.74,SDadults= 0.28), and less likely to choose the high‐novelty option (Madults= 0.16,SDadults= 0.22), whereas children of both age groups tended to do the opposite (high‐reward:M4yo= 0.18,SD4yo= 0.14;M5 − 6yo= 0.30,SD5 − 6yo= 0.27; high‐novelty:M4yo= 0.58,SD4yo= 0.19;M5 − 6yo= 0.48,SD5 − 6yo= 0.23),ps < 0.001, with no differences between the two children's groups,ps > 0.1.

Together, the results revealed an age‐related decrease in novelty‐based decisions and an increase in value‐based decisions with development, suggesting differential impacts of reward value and perceptual novelty on children's and adults’ decisions. Consistently, a Bayesian multinomial logistic regression model fitted to each participant's choices in testing revealed that most adults predominately chose the high‐reward option, whereas most children clearly preferred the high‐novelty option (detailed results are shown inSupplemental Materials).

However, reward value and perceptual novelty were not the only factors influencing choice decisions. Instead, reward variability and choice lag might also affect participants’ choices. Therefore, to better understand age differences in factors driving their choice decisions, we conducted model fitting and analyses and reported the results in the following section.

The full model (outlined in the Computational Modeling section) was fit independently to each participant's observed data using the Nelder‐Mead method in R's optim function. The model was fit five times with 2000 iterations each time using different initial values to find the parameter values that minimized the negative log‐likelihood of the model. All parameter estimates are presented in Figure3.



Distribution of best‐fitting values for all freely estimated weight parameters in the full model across age groups in Experiment 1.

To investigate age differences in the weights of contributing factors, we conducted one‐way ANOVAs on best‐fitting parameter values of all contributing factors in each phase and ran pairwise comparisons between each two age groups. Given the primary focus of the paper, we reported only the pairwise comparison results for the weights of value and novelty in the main text, with complete results reported in theSupplemental Materials.

For training, we found significant age differences in the weight of value,F(2,91) = 8.131,p< 0.001,ηp2= 0.15, objective uncertainty,F(2,91) = 3.146,p= 0.048,ηp2= 0.06, and choice lag,F(2,91) = 5.175,p< 0.01,ηp2= 0.10. Particularly, the weight of value was higher for adults (Madults= 0.85,SDadults= 0.22) than for both 4‐year‐olds (M4yo= 0.54,SD4yo= 0.36) and 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds (M5 − 6yo= 0.63,SD5 − 6yo= 0.33),ps<0.05, with no significant differences between the two child groups,p =0.50.

For testing, we found a significant age difference in value,F(2,91) = 23.8,p< 0.001,ηp2= 0.34, novelty,F(2,91) = 10.92,p< 0.001,ηp2= 0.19, and objective uncertainty,F(2,91) = 6.514,p< 0.01,ηp2= 0.13, with no significant age effect on choice lag,p= 0.304. The weight of value was higher for adults (Madults= 0.67,SDadults= 0.25) than 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds (M5 − 6yo= 0.32,SD5 − 6yo= 0.30) and 4‐year‐olds (M4yo= 0.23,SD4yo= 0.25),ps<0.001. More importantly, the weight of novelty was higher for 4‐year‐olds (M4yo= 0.32,SD4yo= 0.27) and 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds (M5 − 6yo= 0.24,SD5 − 6yo= 0.25) than adults (Madults= 0.06,SDadults= 0.10),ps<0.01. The two child groups did not differ significantly from each other in both cases,ps > 0.34.

Additionally, we found age differences in the randomness of exploration (log‐transformed λ), with children exploring less deterministically than adults (we report the full analysis inSupplementary Materials). However, given that the majority of participants in all age groups were very deterministic, we chose not to over‐interpret these age differences.

In sum, significant age differences were found for all but the choice lag factor at test, indicating that children and adults made decisions based on different latent properties of options. Unlike adults who were primarily reward‐driven, children's decisions seemed to be driven by multiple factors. Importantly, 4‐year‐olds had a higher weight of perceptual novelty than all the other factors, suggesting that perceptual novelty might be the major driver of their decisions. Moreover, large individual differences in the weights of factors suggest that even in participants of the same age group, decisions may be driven by different factors. To examine individual differences in predominant factors driving their decisions, similar to the previous research (Blanco and Sloutsky2021), we fit “single‐process” models to each individual participant.

Four single‐process models (i.e., value‐based, uncertainty‐based, lag‐based, and random) were fit to participants’ training data, and five single‐process models (i.e., value‐based, uncertainty‐based, lag‐based, random, and novelty‐based) were fit to testing data. This was done by setting the weight of the primary factor at 1 and the weights of all the other factors at 0 for each model. Bayesian information criterion (BIC) was used to determine each participant's best‐fit single‐process model for the training and testing phase separately. Models except the random model assumed that participants’ exploration was primarily driven by one factor, whereas the random model assumed random responses without any trial‐to‐trial dependency.

The frequencies of the best‐fit model in the training and testing phases and the transition between them are shown in Figure4. Given that most participants were best fit by the value‐ and the novelty‐based models, and in conjunction with the primary interest of the paper, our analyses focused on these two models.



Heatmap of best‐fit model transition matrix in Experiment 1. The figure illustrates the transition from the best‐fit model in training to the best‐fit model in testing. Darker colors represent a higher frequency of transition.

During training, most participants (21 out of 30 4‐year‐olds, 25 out of 32 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds, and 31 out of 32 adults) were best fit by the value‐based model. Pairwise Fisher's Exact tests conducted on these proportions revealed significant differences between 4‐year‐olds and adults,p< 0.01. However, no significant differences were found between 4‐year‐olds and 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds, or between 5‐ and 6‐year‐olds and adults,ps > 0.16.

By contrast, at test, only a minority of children (4 out of 30 4‐year‐olds, 6 out of 32 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds), and the majority of adults (25 out of 32) were best fit by the value‐based model. Both child age groups were significantly different from adults,ps < 0.001, with no difference from each other,p> 0.99.

Importantly, across‐phase analyses revealed that more value‐based adults (25 out of 31) than 4‐year‐olds (3 out of 21) and 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds (6 out of 25) in training remained value‐based in testing,ps < 0.0001. For those who transitioned from the value‐based model to other models at test, more 4‐year‐olds (11 out of 21) transitioned to the novelty‐based model than adults (3 out of 31),p< 0.01. Additionally, more 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds (9 out of 25) than adults made this transition, although the difference was marginal,p= 0.07. Finally, in general, more 4‐year‐olds (16 out of 30) and 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds (13 out of 32) were best fit by the novelty‐based model than adults (3 out of 32) at test,ps < 0.03, with no significant differences between the child groups,p> 0.99.

In Experiment 1, adults’ decisions were primarily driven by the expected value of the reward, whereas young children's decisions were largely driven by perceptual novelty. Particularly, even for children who were highly value‐based in training, the presence of a perceptually novel option affected their decision patterns by turning many of them into novelty‐based decision‐makers. Moreover, model‐fitting results suggested that perceptual novelty alone, independent of uncertainty, might serve as a primary drive for early exploration. However, such a conclusion requires further testing due to the reasons below.

First, given that children received additional feedback for the high‐novelty option (i.e., “And you met a different animal friend on this color box,” seeSupplemental Materials), they might have learned that the high‐novelty option would always present them with a new animal. Thus, their decisions might be driven by their epistemic uncertainty of novel animals instead of the perceptual novelty of colored squares.

Moreover, although the reward distribution for the high‐novelty option remained unchanged, this information was unknown to participants. Particularly, since the high‐novelty option always appeared as a novel‐colored square, participants might assume a different reward distribution underlying each uniquely colored square. Consequently, children's novelty‐based decisions could be confounded by epistemic uncertainty about expected rewards.

To rule out these possibilities, we fully decoupled perceptual novelty and all sources of epistemic uncertainty in Experiment 2. In addition, the design of Experiment 2 provided an opportunity to examine whether perceptual novelty was strategic or affected children's decisions in a bottom‐up manner.

Experiment 2 included 30 4‐year‐olds (Mage= 4.51 years,SDage= 0.32, 13 girls), 30 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds (Mage= 5.72 years,SDage= 0.51, 10 girls), and 34 adults (Mage= 20.83 years,SDage= 3.27, 16 females).

Experiment 2 included a training and a testing phase and three follow‐up memory questions that probed participants’ recognition of the high‐reward, high‐novelty, and high‐uncertainty options.

The training and testing procedures of Experiment 2 were similar to Experiment 1, except for two major differences. First, the high‐novelty option was introduced during training in Experiment 2 (as shown in Figure1, bottom‐left), with the same reward distribution as the low‐all option (µ= 2,σ= 1, lower bound = 0, upper bound = 4).

Same as in Experiment 1, both the colored squares and animal images remained unchanged throughout the experiment for the high‐reward, high‐uncertainty, and low‐all options, whereas the high‐novelty option was accompanied by a different animal figure, but an unchanging colored square (the second difference from Experiment 1) on each trial in both phases. Importantly, the (new on every trial) animal was fully exposed in the training phase, thus allowing direct access to novelty, whereas novelty was signaled by location and color in testing, as the animal was hidden. To highlight, the unchanging colored square for the high‐novelty option was critically important as it made novelty in testing to be assumed or anticipated, rather than experienced directly.

By implementing these two changes, we were able to (1) decouple novelty and epistemic uncertainty and (2) examine whether perceptual novelty drives early decisions in a bottom‐up or top‐down manner. Given that all the information was presented during training (therefore no epistemic uncertainty), and that the high‐novelty option was associated with the lowest number of rewards, if children still favor this option, it would indicate that their choices are driven purely byperceptualnovelty. Moreover, if children prioritize the high‐novelty option only during training, when perceptual novelty is directly observable, but not during testing, when novelty is only signaled, this would suggest that such novelty‐based decision is bottom‐up, stimulus‐driven, rather than goal‐driven.

The detailed results of the binomial test on children's memories were reported in TableS3. The tests yieldedps < 0.05 for high‐reward and high‐novelty questions, butps > 0.19 for high‐uncertainty questions for both child groups. The results indicated that children, as a group, correctly identified the high‐reward and the high‐novelty options, but not the high‐uncertainty option.

To examine developmental differences in choice patterns, we conducted one‐way ANOVAs (with age as a factor) on the proportions of choosing the high‐reward option and the high‐novelty option in both training and testing phases2. Choice proportions for all four options are shown in Figure5.



The proportion of choosing different options during the training (left) and testing (right) phase for 4‐year‐olds, 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds, and adults in Experiment 2.

For training, we found a significant main effect of age for the high‐reward option,F(2, 91) = 27.65,p< 0.001,ηp2=0.38. The post hoc analysis revealed that adults (Madults= 0.77,SDadults= 0.16) were more likely to choose the high‐reward option compared to both age groups of children (M4yo= 0.33,SD4yo= 0.26;M5 − 6yo= 0.59,SD5 − 6yo= 0.30),ps < 0.01, and 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds were more likely to choose the high‐reward option than 4‐year‐olds,p< 0.001. A significant age effect was also found for the high‐novelty option,F(2, 91) = 20.4,p< 0.001,ηp2= 0.31, with 4‐year‐olds (M4yo= 0.42,SD4yo= 0.28) being more likely to choose the high‐novelty option than both 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds (M5 − 6yo= 0.18,SD5 − 6yo= 0.25) and adults (Madults= 0.07,SDadults= 0.09),ps < 0.001. However, 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds did not significantly differ from adults,p= 0.135.

At the test, we also found a significant main effect of age for the high‐reward option,F(2, 91) = 27.46,p< 0.001,ηp2= 0.38, and for the high‐novelty option,F(2, 91) = 17.41,p< 0.001,ηp2= 0.28. According to the post hoc analysis, adults (Madults= 0.89,SDadults= 0.11) were more likely to choose the high‐reward option compared to both child groups (M4yo= 0.43,SD4yo= 0.31;M5 − 6yo= 0.58,SD5 − 6yo= 0.30),ps < 0.001. However, the difference between 5‐ and 6‐year‐olds and 4‐year‐olds was only marginally significant,p= 0.064. Meanwhile, adults (Madults= 0.02,SDadults= 0.02) were less likely to choose the high‐novelty option than 4‐year‐olds (M4yo= 0.21,SD4yo= 0.17) and 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds (M5 − 6yo= 0.15,SD5 − 6yo= 0.16),ps < 0.001, with no significant difference between the two child groups,p= 0.171.

Moreover, to directly examine the differential effects of the presence versus absence of visible perceptual novelty on children's and adults’ decisions, we conducted mixed ANOVAs on participants’ proportions of choosing the high‐novelty option, with age as a between‐subject variable, and phase as a within‐subject variable. The results revealed significant main effects of age,F(2,91) = 25.88,p< 0.001,ηp2= 0.36, phase,F(1,91) = 21.14,p< 0.001,ηp2= 0.19, and a significant interaction between them,F(2,91) = 6.66,p= 0.002,ηp2= 0.13. Importantly, the proportion of choosing the high‐novelty option dropped significantly from training to testing in 4‐year‐olds,p< 0.001, but not in adults or 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds,ps > 0.661. The results indicated that eliminating direct access to perceptual novelty substantially reduced younger children's novelty preference.

Results from Bayesian multinomial logistic regression model also revealed a consistent preference for the high‐reward option in both adults and 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds in both training and testing. However, consistent with the ANOVA results, 4‐year‐olds showed a clear preference for the high‐novelty option only during training (as shown in theSupplemental Materials). This finding provided additional evidence that perceptual novelty alone could drive decisions in early development. However, such preference attenuated at test, when the option's perceptual novelty was only anticipated but not overtly displayed, suggesting that perceptual novelty might influence young children's choice decisions in a bottom‐up manner.

The full model was fit independently to each participant's observed data with one more free parameter,wn_train, that captured the contribution of visible perceptual novelty in training.

We first conducted one‐way ANOVAs on the weights of all contributing factors, with age being the main effect for training and testing phases separately. We found significant age differences for all contributing factors in training: reward value,F(2,91) = 16.11,p< 0.001,ηp2= 0.26; objective uncertainty,F(2,91) = 3.683,p= 0.029,ηp2= 0.07; perceptual novelty,F(2,91) = 6.77,p< 0.01,ηp2= 0.13; and choice lag,F(2,91) = 3.562,p= 0.0324,ηp2= 0.07. Importantly, the weight of perceptual novelty was higher for 4‐year‐olds (M4yo= 0.47,SD4yo= 0.31) than 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds (M5 − 6yo= 0.27,SD5 − 6yo= 0.28) and adults (Madults= 0.25,SDadults= 0.19),ps<0.01. No significant differences were found between adults and 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds,p> 0.95.

For contributing factors in testing, we found a significant main effect of age for the weight of value,F(2,91) = 9.81,p< 0.001,ηp2= 0.18, anticipated perceptual novelty,F(2,91) = 6.385,p< 0.01,ηp2= 0.12, and choice lag,F(2,91) = 3.122,p= 0.0488,ηp2= 0.06. No significant age effect was found for the weight of objective uncertainty,p= 0.485. The weight of perceptual novelty was higher for 4‐year‐olds (M4yo= 0.19,SD4yo= 0.22) than adults (Madults= 0.05,SDadults= 0.10),p <0.01, with no significant difference between 4‐year‐olds and 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds (M5 − 6yo= 0.14,SD5 − 6yo= 0.16) or between 5‐ and 6‐year‐olds and adults,ps > 0.06. Post hoc pairwise comparison results for other contributing factors in both phases are annotated in Figure6and reported inSupplemental Materials.



Distribution of best‐fitting values for all freely estimated factor weight parameters in the full model across age groups in Experiment 2.

Critically, to examine differential impacts of observable versus anticipated perceptual novelty on participants’ choices, we conducted mixed ANOVA on the weight of perceptual novelty, with age being a between‐subject variable, and phase (or type of perceptual novelty) being a within‐subject variable. The results revealed a significant main effect of age,F(2,91) = 10.159,p< 0.001,ηp2= 0.18, and a significant main effect of phase,F(1,91) = 48.548,p< 0.001,ηp2= 0.35. The interaction did not reach significance,p= 0.127. The results demonstrated an overall important role of perceptual novelty in participants’ novelty‐based decisions across all age groups. Finally, similar to Experiment 1, we found age differences in log‐transformed λ (seeSupplementary Materialsfor full analysis), with participants across all age groups being highly deterministic.

We fit five single‐process models (i.e., value‐based, uncertainty‐based, novelty‐based, lag‐based, and random) for both training and testing. The frequencies of the best‐fit model in the training and testing phases, and the transition between them, are shown in Figure7. Consistent with the goals of Experiment 2, we reported the analyses for only the novelty‐based Model in the main text. Results for the value‐based model can be found inSupplemental Materials.



Heatmap of best‐fit model transition matrix in Experiment 2. The figure illustrates the transition from the best‐fit model in training to the best‐fit model in testing. Darker colors represent a higher frequency of transition.

The analyses on the novelty‐based model revealed that 14 out of 30 4‐year‐olds, 5 out of 30 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds, and none of the adults were best fit by the novelty‐based model in training. Pairwise Fisher's exact tests yielded significant differences between 4‐year‐olds and adults,p< 0.001, but no significant differences between 4‐year‐olds and 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds,p= 0.08, or between 5‐ and 6‐year‐olds and adults,p= 0.06.

As for testing, 4 out of 30 4‐year‐olds, 2 out of 30 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds, and none of the adults were best fit by the novelty‐based model. Pairwise Fisher's Exact tests found no significant differences between any two age groups,ps > 0.12. Consistent with our other findings in Experiment 2, the model comparison results demonstrated that perceptual novelty played a greater role in children's decisions when it could be directly observable.

Finally, most 4‐year‐olds who were best fit by the value‐based model in training continued to be best fit by the value‐based model in testing (8 out of 11). However, only a small fraction of 4‐year‐olds (3 out of 14) who were best fit by the novelty‐based model in training maintained novelty‐based in testing. This pattern suggested different underlying mechanisms for value‐based and novelty‐based decisions for 4‐year‐olds. Value‐based decision‐making appears to be controlled by a goal‐driven (or top‐down) mechanism, enabling children to maintain their strategy even when the reward information was obscured. By contrast, novelty‐based decision‐making seems to be driven by a stimulus‐driven (or bottom‐up) mechanism. Therefore, in the absence of perceptual novelty, children's tendency to utilize a novelty‐based strategy significantly decreased, indicating a reliance on external cues for this type of exploration.

In Experiment 2, we fully decoupled perceptual novelty from all sources of epistemic uncertainty during training and found that perceptual novelty alone could sufficiently and independently drive 4‐year‐olds’, but not 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds’ or adults’ decisions. Particularly, although the high‐novelty option carried increased epistemic uncertainty in testing due to hidden information, 4‐year‐olds reduced their exploration of that option. This finding suggested that 4‐year‐olds were more driven by perceptual novelty than epistemic uncertainty.

Moreover, according to the single‐process model results, there is a critical distinction between value‐based and novelty‐based decisions: while the anticipation of high rewards can drive choices even in young children, the anticipation of novelty does not. This finding indicates that value‐based decision‐making is likely to be a strategic, goal‐directed, top‐down process, whereas novelty‐based decision is likely to be a stimulus‐driven bottom‐up process, as it was highly dependent on the presence of direct perceptual novelty.

Furthermore, developmental findings in Experiment 2 differed somewhat from those in Experiment 1: in Experiment 1, the two child age groups were similar to each other, whereas in Experiment 2, 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds’ decision‐making was more similar to that of adults. In the General discussion, we discussed this further and provided some potential explanations.

The reported research examined the role of perceptual novelty in decision‐making by fully decoupling perceptual novelty from epistemic uncertainty. The results indicate that perceptual novelty is critical, and, by itself, sufficient to drive choices in early development, likely in a bottom‐up manner.

Previous research has suggested that novelty can drive choices. For example, studies have shown that novelty is inherently rewarding as dopaminergic neurons that code reward‐prediction errors also respond to stimulus novelty (Düzel et al.2010; Gottlieb2012; Kakade and Dayan2002; Wittmann et al.2008), and novel stimuli can activate dopamine cells even when they are not objectively uncertain or predictive of rewards (Düzel et al.2010; Kakade and Dayan2002). This suggests that perceptual novelty may serve as an independent driver of exploration unrelated to other choice attributes. However, in most previous studies, novelty was confounded with epistemic uncertainty. The current study extends these findings by decoupling novelty and uncertainty and providing new evidence that, in early development, perceptual novelty alone can drive choices.

Given that perceptual novelty drives young children's decisions even in the absence of epistemic uncertainty, and that its impact is contingent on its being explicitly present, children's novelty‐based decisions are presumably a stimulus‐driven, bottom‐up process. Such results aligned with previous findings that the presence of a salient choice disrupted children's systematic exploration, implying an important role of attention in early exploration (Blanco and Sloutsky2020).

If a perceptually novel stimulus automatically captures attention, why does it predominate only in young children? The protracted development of cognitive control may explain this difference. Adults, with mature cognitive control, can suppress the attractiveness of the novel option, and direct their attention to the most rewarding option. In contrast, young children with immature cognitive control, are more prone to attention being automatically captured by perceptually novel stimuli, and experiencing more difficulty disengaging from them (Gaspelin et al.2015; Hayre et al.2022).

To note, our findings that perceptual novelty drives young children's decisions in a bottom‐up manner do not contradict the notion that novelty‐based decisions can be guided by a top‐down process. Due to the common confound of novelty and epistemic uncertainty in real‐world situations, children's novelty‐seeking behaviors are very likely to stem from both a top‐down process to reduce uncertainty and a bottom‐up attentional capture. Additionally, children may simply pursue their self‐established goals to find enjoyment in novel experiences. Our results are not incompatible with these possibilities. Rather, they complement these perspectives by providing new evidence that young children's novelty‐based decisions can also arise from a bottom‐up process.

Finally, we noticed that despite evident age differences between 4‐year‐olds and adults in both experiments, 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds’ decision‐making was more comparable to 4‐year‐olds in Experiment 1, but more comparable to adults in Experiment 2. Specifically, 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds were more novelty‐based than adults at the test stage of Experiment 1, but were no different from adults in their high‐novelty choices during the training of Experiment 2. These differences may reflect the interaction between the development of attentional mechanisms and exploration‐exploitation strategies. On the one hand, 5‐ to 6‐year‐olds with relatively more mature attentional control than 4‐year‐olds, were less susceptible to automatic attention capture by the perceptually novel option, resulting in a reduction in selecting the high‐novelty option in Experiment 2. On the other hand, as found in previous studies, 5‐ to 6‐year‐old's decision‐making could be substantially influenced by choices’ epistemic uncertainty (Blanco and Sloutsky2020,2021; Meder et al.2021). Therefore, a novel option in conjunction with some epistemic uncertainty of rewards (as was the case in Experiment 1 testing) likely dominated their choices.

One potential limitation of the study is the assumption of nonnegative weights for all factors influencing participants’ choice decisions in the model construction. This assumption may not always hold, particularly given previous findings of uncertainty aversion in adults (Cockburn et al.2022; Nussenbaum et al.2023). However, since the primary focus of this study was on young children, who did not exhibit uncertainty aversion, we do not consider this limitation as a critical concern.

Additionally, although the current research provides substantial evidence for a link between attentional mechanisms and exploration in early development, it did not directly measure participants’ attentional orientation during the tasks. Therefore, future research is expected to use eye‐tracking to directly measure children's overt attention to provide more evidence for the role of attention in early exploration and how the development of attention shapes the emergence of an exploitation tendency.

The current research investigated the contribution of perceptual novelty, in the absence of epistemic uncertainty, to exploration in early development. By fully disentangling perceptual novelty and all forms of epistemic uncertainty, we provided novel evidence that 4‐year‐olds’ decisions, unlike adults’ and older children's, could be driven solely by perceptual novelty even when it was not associated with uncertainty or rewards. Additionally, we found that a novel option predominated in children's choices only when its novelty was directly observable, indicating that perceptual novelty drives early choices in a bottom‐up manner.

In this study, we present an analysis of interviews with parents and teachers in order to understand the lived experience of families and teachers trying to support children with written language difficulties. Within these accounts, the value of a dyslexia diagnosis is examined in practice. Nineteen parents and 20 educators were interviewed, including four parents who completed additional interviews 4 years after their original accounts. Our analysis indicated that dyslexia is rendered largely invisible in our sample of English schools, with staff frequently reluctant to fully acknowledge it. The analysis suggests mechanisms that appear to underpin successful support or harm to students. An important feature was the role and recognition of diagnosis in increasing the visibility of children's needs. Without recognition and understanding, support was inconsistent and ineffectual.

Literacy, the ability to understand and produce written language, is an important sociocultural tool (e.g., Perry2012). Literacy allows us to move beyond direct but transitory oral interpersonal communication and to access and create lasting contributions to society and culture (Freire1983). Within that context, a systematic difference in the capacity to become literate has broader impacts with respect to societal participation, as well as immediate impacts on the ability to function day‐to‐day. However, there are questions about how visible and impactful those difficulties are within the education system.

One form of restriction in acquiring literacy is termed dyslexia. A recent consensus definition (Carroll et al.2025) indicates that dyslexia is primarily a set of processing difficulties that affects aspects of literacy attainment, despite the educational opportunity to learn to read and spell. These processing difficulties can include phonological processing, working memory and processing speed. Difficulties in reading fluency are a key marker of the disorder. These difficulties are rooted in the cognitive processes that underpin learning to read and write, and other skills and behaviours that are dependent on those same disrupted processes (e.g., phonological memory) are likely to be impacted too (Roitsch and Watson2019).

The unexpected nature of the difficulty, the diversity in strengths and difficulties experienced by the learner, as well as the ‘unconventional intellect when confronted with problems and situations’ (Macdonald2019, 18) are features of the lay‐narrative associated with dyslexia, along with reading and writing difficulties (see also Rooke2017).

There is controversy about how dyslexia should be recognised and diagnosed (Evans2020; Kirby2020; Protopapas2019; Snowling et al.2020). In particular, Elliott (Elliott and Grigorenko2014; Elliott2020) argues that there is no meaningful way of identifying a dyslexic subgroup within the larger pool of poor readers, and even if there were, no interventions are differentially appropriate for these two groups. Hence, he argues that there is no value in the diagnostic assessment of dyslexia. This view has been taken on by some local education authorities in the UK, both implicitly and explicitly (Bodkin2019).

The view that dyslexia has a lack of diagnostic utility partially aligns with the Special Educational Needs and Disability (SEND) Code of Practice (Department of Education and Department of Health2015). This document, which advises on access and support for children with SEND in England, emphasises support according to need, rather than diagnosis. This has the laudable aim of reducing barriers to support. Taken together, these factors create a situation in which both teachers and parents can be confused about the value of diagnostic assessment for individuals with dyslexia. If support is provided according to need and a dyslexia diagnosis has no value in planning intervention, then why seek diagnosis? This is a question we will address by engaging with parents who have made the decision to pursue additional educational support for their dyslexic children.

There are systemic and geographic factors contributing to the risk of poor reading outcomes in addition to ‘within‐child’ factors. There is widespread evidence that poor educational outcomes are more likely in particular geographic areas (e.g., Johnson2020). Quinn and Wagner (2013) found that rates of dyslexia identification were gendered, with 1:4 boys being identified with literacy difficulties but only 1:7 girls. Dyslexia is also less likely to be identified in some groups such as Afro‐Caribbean and Gypsy/Romany/Traveller heritage communities (Lindsay et al.2006). In other words, cultural and contextual factors play an important role in how dyslexic students are identified and supported. Therefore, while much of the previous research on dyslexia has focused on the mechanics of learning to decode and spell, factors predicting the outcomes of individuals with dyslexia are much more complex, and it is crucial to consider the context in which a child is learning and developing.

Literacy difficulties are associated with wellbeing risks, such as increased anxiety, and some clinically recognised mental health difficulties (Carroll et al.2005; Francis et al.2019). The extent to which the association between dyslexia and mental health issues is explained by shared risk factors (such as genetics) or reciprocal causation, rather than directly as a consequence of dyslexia, remains unclear (Carroll et al.2005). However, qualitative studies seem to suggest that mental health issues are caused by difficulties managing dyslexic needs in schools (Carroll et al.2005; Dahle et al.2011; Ingesson2007; Kalka and Lockiewicz2018; Leitão et al.2017; Riddick2010). Recently, Wilmot et al. (2023) identified the impact of fatigue and exhaustion at school on dyslexic pupils' mental health. Any failure or delay in recognising children with reading difficulties at school is likely to compound such risks, generating psychological stress.

Longer term, individuals with dyslexia are at increased risk of multiple negative social outcomes (Aro et al.2019). Further work by Banks et al. (2023) has highlighted the cumulative social burden, increasing across the lifespan, that disability and inequality create. However, such research has had little impact on practice. The tacit assumption has been that effective skills‐based remediation of literacy difficulties will also address such secondary impacts, but we argue that this may not necessarily be the case.

When considering the impact of dyslexia in a classroom situation, it is crucial to consider whether the child with dyslexia experiences ‘inclusion’. Göransson and Nilholm (2014) have provided a useful four‐level descriptor of different levels of inclusion in a classroom/school, as follows:

Inclusion as placement in mainstream classrooms

Inclusion as meeting the social and academic needs of pupils with disabilities

Inclusion as meeting the needs of all pupils

Inclusion as the creation of communities.

The current study used this framework of different understandings of inclusion to frame the experiences of the pupils, as recounted by the parents.

Previous research that has addressed school experiences of dyslexic learners has tended to focus on personal experiences recalled by adults (cf. Deacon et al.2020) or teacher reports (cf. Dymock and Nicholson2023). Relatively few studies have examined parental narratives of children's progress over time. Parents and primary caregivers have unique perspectives on their children's experiences because they hold a longitudinal account of educational difficulties from preschool onwards. Moreover, they are consistent observers of the consequences of teaching, learning and the school experience on their child. They also bring other insights, providing an account of the lived experience of dyslexia beyond that observed in the classroom.

The literature alludes to the realities for children with a profile of literacy‐based difficulties, and the impact of the contested definition of dyslexia (cf. Department for Education2021; Elliott and Grigorenko2014; Gibbs and Elliott2020). However, there has been no work to date that has looked at the impact of how a focus away from dyslexia diagnosis and its core constructs (see Snowling et al.2020) has impacted children's, parents' and teachers' experience of securing good outcomes and inclusion for children with written language difficulties. This study set out to understand the impact of securing or not securing a diagnosis of dyslexia on outcomes and inclusion for children and young people, using parental and teacher interviews as data sources. Parents were asked to share their stories of securing educational support for their children's literacy difficulties. Teachers were asked to talk about how they approached supporting children with dyslexia or other literacy difficulties in their classrooms. By interrogating these accounts in parallel, we were able to explore the role of dyslexia diagnosis in current educational practice, and how variations in that practice impacted children's outcomes.

The focus of this study is on children in mainstream provision in English schools. In order to interrogate different perspectives in the same timeframe, parental accounts were analysed alongside accounts from class teachers and teaching assistants. This captured differing perspectives that could be used to support or challenge the other group's data and give a robust account. Data were collected from five Local Authority areas, and participants were recruited through snowball sampling via initial contact with knowledgeable others; this approach enabled the sampling of diverse socioeconomic/environmental characteristics, structural/policy frameworks, and activism levels. Participants were recruited in two phases: Phase One (2013/2014) and Phase Two (2017/2018).

An initial participant group of five parents was recruited through personal contacts; their children started in mainstream primary and all had Statements of Special Educational Need (later converted to Education Health and Care Plans) with literacy difficulties as a key feature. At transfer to secondary school, these parents went to tribunal to secure enhanced provision for secondary education including additional teaching and therapies. Intermittent contact was maintained with this group, and the pupils who remained as state sector pupils were followed up in Year 11 as part of Phase Two. In Phase Two, the teachers and remaining parents were purposefully recruited via snowball sampling in order to bridge gaps in the sample's diversity. Teachers from schools representing diverse socioeconomic profiles were recruited through key contacts to provide a contemporaneous account of mainstream classroom practices and understanding of literacy difficulties. With the exception of the rural primary school, these teachers did not teach the specific children belonging to the parent participants.

Most previous research on dyslexia has focused on one perspective from one group of respondents. In contrast, Critical Realism (Fletcher2016) is a philosophical stance that allows multiple respondents' viewpoints to be synthesised. This is crucial to fully understand how dyslexia is understood in English schools; including the core issues of why outcomes for these students have been characterised at the end of education by persistent underperformance (Alexander‐Passe2015; All‐Party Parliamentary Group For Dyslexia and other SpLDs2019; see also Elliot Major and Parsons2022). Fletcher (2016) converts the philosophical stance of Critical Realism into a research strategy. The two key methodological tasks are to elicit the observable/partially observable realities (the ‘actual’ level) and to identify the unobservable realities (the ‘real’ level). In order to do this, participant accounts (the ‘empirical’ level) are interrogated by the researcher and placed within the context of the other accounts to identify key evidence and drivers. The real level is achieved via a process of abduction (theoretical redescription) and retroduction (focusing on inferred causal mechanisms). Retroduction relies upon taking a critical stance and considering competing explanations (Yin2018). For example, the impact of a school's acknowledgement of a dyslexia diagnosis, and their policies around assessment are the ‘actual’ level implied by the empirical level data of parent and teacher accounts. Analysis further allows for identification of ‘real’ levels themes such as ‘being able to see dyslexia’.

Our analytic process drew on reflexive thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke2006). All the way through the analysis, consideration was given to the way that people told their own stories. At times, the words alone did not convey the emotion behind the story, and thus it was important to consider the narrative retelling in addition to the objective events. Annotations were used to capture the first author's responses to content using the facilities within NVivo and to avoid the risk of post hoc fallacy as well as check for rigour. In this respect, the approach is consistent with a reflexive stance as described by Braun and Clarke (2023). Another part of the quality process was a panel of four colleagues, each drawing from different methodological traditions and focuses, who acted as critical advisors during the analysis. These panel meetings were recorded and then used for further reflexive work.

We positioned our work and analysis within a developmental and critical realism paradigm because the manifestation of dyslexia and subsequent life outcomes were seen as the interaction between core features within the individual and wider systems and environments. The mediating factor was the form and nature of agency in how individuals sought to manage or overcome structural features. This applied to children, parents and teaching staff. Critical realism does not take a position with respect to attributing causality to either biological or social–structural mechanisms, but rather takes the view that all forms of structure are contributory, and agency impacts upon their manifestation in the observable world.

Key to this at all levels was both the cognitive and social structure and what agency was exerted to manage structural impact. An additional dimension of positionality was that the principal impact of dyslexia was in the disturbance of inclusion and agency rather than just a focus on reading and writing. The first researcher's positionality was also informed by her own experiences of dyslexia and academic enquiry, as well as her experience working in the field of mental health and rehabilitation. This was salient when, as it transpired, she was dealing with parents who demonstrated evidence of trauma.

The development of the interview protocols was based upon the work of Qu and Dumay (2011) for issues of balance and power, and Alvesson (2003) who developed a continuum of interview orientation and positioning from objective reality (positivist) to experiential (romanticist) with a mid‐point of ‘localism’ framing of both factual and experiential interviews. These were important, as the nature of the interview orientation would frame the quality of responses, with some strategies more likely to elicit structural features and others more agency aspects.

Two different semi‐structured interview protocols were developed. The interviews contained a mixture of semi‐structured and open‐ended questions, with content developed as part of a themed framework. Parents' interviews were framed around ‘tell me what happened in your experiences of getting support for your child’. For teachers, the theme was ‘what do you do to support individuals with dyslexia or literacy difficulties and why?’. In addition, all participants were asked ‘how do you understand inclusion and dyslexia?’

There were 19 parent participants in the study (see Table1). Parents had at least one child with dyslexia, with the ages of the children ranging from Year 2 (age 6–7) to Year 11 (age 15–16), and a cluster of 10 children at Year 7 and Year 8 (ages 11 to 13). Pseudonyms are used throughout.

Parent participant details.

Anonymised details of the teachers who were interviewed are detailed in Table2, alongside the nature of the school they were working in at the time of their interview. Interviews with this group were undertaken either individually or as part of a small group. Schools ranged from urban schools with relatively high socioeconomic challenges, through to more suburban and rural schools.

School staff demographics.

Ethical permission was sought and granted from Coventry University Ethics approval system. Participants were recruited through word of mouth, via specialist teachers, and through community organisations. Interviews were undertaken by the lead author and were recorded, transcribed, corrected (as part of the familiarisation process), anonymised and then uploaded to NVivo, which was used to build analysis from the ground up. The value of NVivo for such a long project was that its tools allowed contemporaneous notes that were easily accessible and could be built upon in further analysis when returning to the data at a later point. In this respect, the data analysis was iterative rather than linear.

Our analysis enabled 40 subthemes at the actual level to be identified, each interacting with at least one other subtheme and most with multiple interactions. These are shown in Figure1. Some connections facilitated visibility of the child and their needs across parents and school staff. They created positive ecosystems supporting, and thereby promoting, different levels of inclusion of meeting needs, a sense of community (Göransson and Nilholm2014), and the child's access to education. Other combinations generated a negative ecosystem constraining or locking out a child's access to education and, in some cases, even dissolving basic level inclusion of having a presence in the classroom (or school) (Göransson and Nilholm2014). There were also subthemes that were in conflict with each other. Many of the subthemes came directly from the voice of participants. Others were abstracted from patterns across the data.



Simplified representation of subthemes identified at the actual level from data and the real level themes.

Four ‘real level’ themes were extracted from the actual and empirical level data reported by parents and teachers. These were labelled ‘Seeing Dyslexia’, ‘Being Seen with Dyslexia’, ‘Being able to See Dyslexia’ and ‘Boundaries of Diagnosis’. In presenting the findings the parental voice has been foregrounded. This is consistent with the project's ethical stance.

Some themes were much more prominent in parents' accounts and others more prominent in teacher accounts. Taken as a whole, parents and teachers agreed that some children require additional literacy support to succeed in school, but they differed in terms of how they felt it should be implemented. Narratives that centred on successful outcomes for the families tended to highlight synergies between parent and teacher perspectives, while less successful narratives often showed a disconnect between parent and teacher perspectives on the same issue. For example, teacher accounts tended to have a focus on short term concerns and the implementation of local policies, whereas parental accounts were more sensitive to the implications of their child's challenges over a longer period of time extending beyond a single academic year. Furthermore, parents were predominantly focused upon the socio‐emotional wellbeing of their child.

Broadly, while both parent and educator accounts agreed that problems in acquiring literacy gave rise to difficulties, the perspectives of the difficulties, the relative weighting of themes and the impact on the participants were different. Parents were predominantly focused on the impact on social‐, emotional‐ and confidence‐related outcomes for their child; on the distress that the educational experience and lack of peer‐equivalent progress gave rise to, as observed out of school and from the child's accounts of school. Parents also contextualised their account by considering the implications across the span of education and also post‐education. The use of longitudinal data was particularly helpful in this regard. It also enabled further identification of relevant data from the cross‐sectional interviews.

The lack of literacy progress impacted educational progress and was linked in many, but not all cases, to a lack of social confidence and for some to marked denigration or bullying. However, there were occasions where peer social connectedness and learning accommodations appeared to provide a protective mechanism. Under those circumstances, parents scaled back their efforts at securing literacy support, and the implication was that they did not see dyslexia as so problematic at that point. Importantly, social connectedness and accommodations did not address the fundamental problems of literacy difficulties. This did change when children were in secondary school, and the impact of unaddressed literacy difficulties became apparent to parents.

Teachers were principally concerned about progress at a group level, within the class year and the organisational impact of trying to secure that progress at the subgroup or group level, in the context of limited resources. This led to them using strategies such as putting strong students next to weaker ones in planning classroom layout or using combined class groupings at primary level to target learning. They were all aware of the need for children to make sufficient progress in their class. But there was no plan if the child failed to meet the target threshold. The knowledge base on dyslexia and effective management for educators was limited unless they had engaged in additional training. For some teachers, local education policy on the refusal to recognise the term or construct of dyslexia was an additional barrier to navigating effective management and access to specialist training.

These different perspectives are important for understanding how dyslexia can be rendered visible or invisible through the actions of teachers, schools and parents in the name of inclusion. They also illustrate both the shorter‐ and longer‐term implications of invisibility and visibility for children's academic and socio‐emotional outcomes.

Our analysis indicated that children with dyslexia and their parents did not see, or experience dyslexia as confined to a contextualised reading and writing deficit, as Elliott (2020) might suggest. Rather, they saw it as a source of disturbance in developing agency and inclusion across a range of settings, giving rise to distress. Their accounts often drew upon strengths‐based narratives. For example, as Oliver reported ‘somebody said to me [dyslexia's] a learning difference, it's a social difference, we're all different for many ways’. Similarly, Wendy's construction of dyslexia emphasised positivity: ‘I always big up dyslexia and he's very creative so I think he thinks it's all part of being creative’. Such understandings of dyslexia indicate a difference in the perspectives between traditional, formal definitions of dyslexia and the lived experience of it.

However, parents also saw dyslexia as a barrier to inclusion in mainstream education. Using the Göransson and Nilholm (2014) hierarchical model, their children were positioned at the lowest rung of being placed in the classroom but without needs being met. In the following exchange, Penny, Susan and Oliver, who had children in primary and secondary school, capture the themes that occurred across the data of how dyslexia impacted their children's inclusion in the learning environment, their capacity to express agency and the lack of awareness in teaching staff regarding learning needs. In this exchange Susan's demeanour and tone conveyed her anger at what she perceived to be a second‐class education her child received:

PENNY:Inclusion to me and the way it is with Peter is that they have, the educational system have set down, ‘and this is what they've got to be taught’, ‘this is the way they've got to be taught and at the age of this they've got to be able to do this, this, this and this’. Well, all children are different, and they don't all learn at the same rates. So, inclusion for me means that it's at the expense of his dyslexia, he isn't getting the teaching he needs and taught the way he needs to be taught in order to reach the same standard as them.

I:So actually, this idea of inclusion, everybody having the same actually acts as exclusion for your son?

PENNY:Yes.

PENNY:He's not being included because they have to be taught that way.

SUSAN:They're always given a classroom assistant.

OLIVER:Can I add to that, my wife has to play dumb me down because I've got very animated about it, very frustrated in that if my child had two legs missing and the PE teacher told him to get out and run the 100 metres, we'd be taking them off for discrimination. Yet Oscar and Owen, I hear time and time again, it's always from the sodding English department, ‘you're not trying hard enough’, ‘you can't read’, ‘you can't this’ and you think well yeah, he's got dyslexia.

The exchange above is illustrative of a how a limitation of visibility for a child's profile, including needs and strengths, generates environments where inclusion does not extend beyond the base level of presence in a class as described by Göransson and Nilholm (2014). It captures the degree of frustration and distress for the parents, linked to the lack of visibility of their child. The three parents explain that their children have been offered a lesser education and experienced exclusion or a lack of inclusion in different ways by non‐adapted curriculum delivery, being allocated to support staff rather than qualified teachers, and unsympathetic expectations and child blaming. It highlighted how the lack of skills meant a child's personal agency was compromised. In the case of Oliver's children, poor outcomes were attributed to a lack of effort on the children's part. For Penny and Susan, the isolation occurred because the child was either limited or unable to access education and express their agency as it was delivered to the majority of the class. This illustrates the complexity of sources of progressive failure in educational access with wide ramifications not only to inclusion in the here and now but the longer term too.

What parents frequently (but not always) saw was a mixed picture of uneven access to education across the years, poorly informed staff, combined with a policy that lacked sensitivity and responsiveness. Our data showed that this was apparent from the start of education:

TRACY:there appears to be no money, no specialist knowledge, not even a basic knowledge, I've had people …I had one teacher say I've been teaching for 15 years and I've never come across a dyslexic…

WENDY:the only frustration is recently in the last six months, with his weekly spelling test, which he fails every week because he can't possibly ever pass.

The extracts above capture how lack of knowledge and inflexibility generate progressive harm. The school in Wendy's case spotted there was a problem in Years 1 and 2 but then said they had to wait until he was 2 years behind before they could assess and meanwhile carried on without adaptions and were still doing so at the time of interview in Year 4. This is inconsistent with the SEND Code of Practice of Assess, Plan, Do, Review (Department of Education and Department of Health2015) and is discredited practice, but also reflects a lack of knowledge and sensitivity.

Some years, or subject teachers, were better than others. There were examples of good practice and well‐informed staff in the data, with both staff and parents recognising this. In those accounts, there were examples of not only a child's needs being met but also a sense of community being engendered, thus accelerating the child up the inclusion hierarchy as described by Göransson and Nilholm (2014). One example was a rural primary school where the staff had received Local Authority training on dyslexia, and each of the three staff in the group interview had significant postgraduate training and qualifications. Their accounts demonstrated close working with parents and a critical stance on evidence‐based practice, policy and delivery of education:

GEMMA:He is eight [talking of George]. When he started school, I gave the teachers then the heads‐up. Then he went to the next teacher, and it's followed‐on from each teacher!….’ I got more information from the school this morning than I got last night, even then I didn't… he doesn't give that out freely

GWEN:we've made school‐based decisions which aren't always easily or happily…done, because training's taught people who teach children phonics and they learn by phonics, and they just keep plugging away at it until eventually one day they get it. Well, that is not the case, so we decided that Year 3, no, because that's just making them feel worse…. you've got to try and just prove it and doing the precision teaching.

GWEN:Yeah, we've got family learning, keeping up with children's English, that started on Friday.

GEMMA:Yes, so I came to that, so I could help George at school, so we're just learning verbs, nouns and things, that I'm meant to concentrate on.

In the above extract, the mother of George, Gemma, talks about how she liaised with the school on her son's needs, and finds out on a daily basis what he has been up to so she can engage her son at home and vice versa. There was evidence as illustrated above of reducing home school barriers and working in the child's interests. Gwen, who is the SENCO (Special Educational Needs Coordinator) discusses how her professional observations about the outcomes from a pure phonics program led her to investigate other teaching strategies that she identified by author, such as precision teaching and real book reading (Solity and Vousden2009). This was supported by the other staff in the interview. Finally, Gwen and Gemma talk about a parental literacy engagement program. One observation from this interview was how staff drew upon their postgraduate training to articulate their positions, and this was unusual within the study.

In another interview Fraser, a teacher in a large urban school, also illustrated the value of diagnosis in facilitating the recognition of other pupils with written language difficulties as dyslexic ‘After teaching previous children who were diagnosed with dyslexia, I see similar traits with… I've got two girls in my class that show similar traits’. This led him to reach out to the family who it turned out had a history of dyslexia. This neatly illustrates how an individual child's visibility has wider ramifications for communities of learners which also include teachers and families elaborating the community aspect of the hierarchy (Göransson and Nilholm2014). However, these types of informed practitioners formed a minority in the accounts.

Epistemic injustice (Byskov2020) describes the forms of injustice that arise from those with relevant knowledge and information not being acknowledged or listened to. One of the challenges has been the positioning of parents as not holding relevant knowledge:

TRACY:Foundation, I was already talking to teachers going there's something wrong, why isn't learning at the same rate as everybody else?

I:And what were they saying back?

TRACY:He's a boy, just forget about it.

YVETTE:I went back to that teacher and said this is what I think [he had dyslexia], and she didn't really want to know, and whether that's a budgetary thing, they didn't want to go down the formal diagnostic route and that sort of thing, so we just left it really, and just tried to support him as much as we could.

XAVIER:I think for our little boy, we were not taken seriously. I think there was an undermining of the need.

The lack of accessible public funded diagnostic routes articulated in the data is also reflected in the literature (Knight and Crick2021) and the reluctance of schools to commission assessments or have effective screening, placed very significant barriers for parents seeking support. In the extracts above parents were perceiving risk to wider inclusion due to disruption in learning progress, but this was not acknowledged. However, from a different perspective Imogen, SENCO in an area of deprivation, noted that for her area there were policy drivers and parental engagement factors around non‐acknowledgment: ‘because it's not diagnosed locally, parents have to pay for it privately if they want a diagnosis, [..] but parents just can't afford it. […] Yeah, I can't say it [assessment] wouldn't be viable for everybody but on the whole, it wouldn't be a priority as such’. One reading of Imogen's account is local cultural milieu and the localised narrative on the value of education may also act as a barrier for individual parents who want to support their child. Parents in the study sought diagnostic assessment because school provision is perceived to be failing their child, and they are seeking to increase the visibility and authority of their interactions as they try to secure support. In these respects, the parents value education, but what was also pervasive was they are also driven by their child's distress. For parents where there were difficulties in literacy and learning but the child was happy in school, they were not engaged in the same way. Beth talking about her son Bob in Year 3 was an example ‘that I maybe sat back on my laurels a bit because he was happy, he liked the teacher and he was making some progress, not vast amounts of progress…’. However, when Bob's distress and failure to make progress returned in Year 4 she took very direct action in securing support. Beth's account demonstrated the fluidity of inclusion levels (Göransson and Nilholm2014) across years for this group of pupils, and the variable educational access. From this we see that because of the way inclusion is situated around a specific school year or classroom experience, discontinuities emerge as children transition from one class, teacher or year group to another. In this respect the accounts illustrate a limitation in focus of the Göransson and Nilholm (2014) account as it does not address the disruptive transitions between years and settings.

In many cases, it was child distress, rooted in lack of inclusion and loss of parity in agency, that led to parental action, often in the form of seeking formal diagnosis through private providers to make visible the child's needs and strengths. Tracy went on to describe what happened next ‘By the time he was seven, I'd borrowed some money off my dad to get him diagnosed as dyslexic which we did, that was Year 3, and they were still not interested, the teachers didn't seem to have any knowledge about dyslexia whatsoever’. Diverging from the narrative in Knight and Crick's (2021) account of the financially comfortable middle‐class securing diagnosis, the parents in this study came from a distribution of economic backgrounds. As Tracy alludes to, to secure the diagnosis she had to borrow money from family, others used credit cards or took out loans, and only some were able to afford it outright. But as Lucy noted the impact on non‐receptive schools was blunted ‘Oh yeah, he wrote a massive report but, because I'd taken it private, at that point in time the school wouldn't accept it because they hadn't done it’. Karen understood this rejection and persisted to get the school to pay, ‘I just felt, and I don't know if this is true or not, but I really felt I wanted it to come from the school. Because I felt I would be classed as some middle‐class mum whose child was underachieving and I just felt strongly that it would hold more sway if it came from the school’. One interpretation is that schools were resistant to making the child's needs explicitly visible at the individual level, as that was perceived to generate obligations.

A related issue regarding visibility and being seen, is that parental accounts of their children's experiences of dyslexia were minimised or denied. Yvette was unclear on why they would not investigate her son's needs, and this form of epistemic injustice was painful, given the obvious nature of his difficulty. It did not occur to her, or indeed the other parents in the study, that the school may have taken a hostile view towards the diagnosis of dyslexia. For them it was incomprehensible why action was not taken, and they assumed that the diagnosis was perceived as valid by the school. Frequently the parents sought explanations that lay outside the school, delay was attributed to lack of money, as captured by Lucy ‘I genuinely think it was all to do with money. They've got too many kids that year that have been diagnosed with dyslexia’ or Yvette ‘I just get the sense that primary schools are so budget constrained and don't have the knowledge almost that … I don't know what to expect them to do really’. It was only rarely that parents challenged this unaffordable account and Oliver was a case in point:

OLIVER:We pushed very hard with the school. ‘Too expensive, too expensive’, ‘right where is it, we'll pay for it’, ‘no you don't have to’, ‘well then you do it’, ‘oh well maybe next year when we've got the budget’, ‘well you're either going to do it or not’. So it was meeting after meeting with the head teacher being a case of well you say he can do better, you've got to get on his side and help.

Given Oliver's account there is a sense of schools not wanting the information, not that they could not necessarily afford the assessment in the context of overall budget. There was a clue later in Yvette's account when a supply teacher took the opportunity at a parents evening to tell her he thought her son had dyslexia ‘and the other thing that the supply teacher did was say don't just concentrate your efforts within school, reach out and see what else is available to you’. It can be inferred from the account overall that the supply teacher had taken the measure of the school and was advising accordingly. The hostile view was also reflected in Imogen's account of local policy, which has been promoted in some academic and education settings (cf. Gibbs and Elliott2020), but for parents who observe the difficulties, the distress, the loss of inclusion and agency for their child, and the failure of the system to deliver education, this ‘deny policy’ and academic position has little meaning or validity.

It has been argued that dyslexia forms part of a natural continuum of difference, and all that is required is the application of evidence‐based interventions to resolve the issues (e.g., Protopapas2019; Snowling et al.2020). The proposition relies on individual teachers and schools being able to accurately recognise the dyslexic profile of needs and meet those needs. As can be seen from the above section, this is an important gap in the strategy. In the following extracts, different components of this approach are considered. In the first case, Tracy, who had paid for private lessons out of school and had secured a private assessment, found that both the primary and secondary schools refused to acknowledge or respond to the relevant information. In the extract, she described the current situation of her funding out of school lessons for Thomas, who was in Year 7, and the demands of schoolwork:

TRACY:I don't know because it's just a gut feeling, he's doing letters and sounds through the ‘Beat Dyslexia’ but he's been asked to critically analyse, he's doing ‘The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas’ and it's so much more advanced than just reading, you just think the gap is just getting bigger and bigger [..]

I:Can he actually read?

TRACY:He can read but he can read at the age of about a 6‐year‐old. [..] he certainly can't critically analyse it, he can't do anything to do with things like images and things like that it's way beyond him, he can't do it.

In this respect the diagnosis had no impact on successful inclusion for Thomas, but only because the school rejected it. In rejecting the information in the report, they also failed to address needs, or call in specialists to assist. It seems the school had low aspirations for Thomas, who was bullied, sometimes very badly, and despondent at school. He was isolated both socially and academically, despite his mother's best efforts.

The other aspects of Tracy's account that permeated the data were how parents saw dyslexia, and in particular the reading and writing aspects. They frequently commented on their child's difficulties with writing and spelling, which were self‐evident. However, reading difficulties, including age‐appropriateness, were less consistently identified by parents. This gap in understanding reading deficits was apparent across the data. Susan, who did persuade her primary school to get her daughter Sarah assessed when she was 10, recounted ‘We kept asking the school about it and they would just say oh she's just a bit behind. I kept saying to the school that I thought she was 12 months' behind where she should be’ but this assessment was only after an external tutor advised her to get a formal assessment, and she had additional supporting evidence:

SUSAN:all along I said I thought she was a year behind where she was, but she wasn't, she was two years behind and they said they'd never come across a child with such low self‐esteem. Normally if you read a report, it sounds better and you can pick more things out, more positives but the more ‘I read it, the worse it sounded’. [..] It did take quite a while then, it's not until she's now at secondary school (age 12 Year 8) that they're doing something about it.

The school failed to acknowledge Sarah's difficulties, despite Susan's prompting from the beginning, and had minimised rather than investigated. By the time of the assessment the damage was significant, and when information was provided towards the end of primary education, the school did not action the information in a timely and relevant way, and it took time in secondary school for help to be provided. This represented lost years of at best partial educational access and contingent impact on mental health. It also further illustrated one of the limitations of the Göransson and Nilholm (2014) hierarchical model which was derived from systematic review of literature, in that it is essentially focused upon the classroom. It speaks less to the transitions and future needs across the span of education and post‐secondary education.

Karen was in the same position as Susan; she had secured an assessment just prior to school transfer. In her case staff had been explicit about dismissing the value of diagnosis, which they delayed for 18 months; ‘They said, he doesn't need to be assessed because we've put everything in place as if he was dyslexic’. However, the value of this analysis, the confidence in their ‘diagnosis of need’ and their provision was rapidly debunked when Kevin transferred to his next school:

KAREN:He couldn't copy off the board or if he did he couldn't read it back to himself. Or he couldn't finish off writing what was down from the board there. So, they got someone else to write it for him. [..] now, [age 13 Year 8] they have just done some reading and he is at a reading age of eight and he is thirteen. So, he is very far behind. And that really, actually, I wasn't even expecting that this year. I didn't realise he was as far behind as that. So, that shocked me this year.

It was not clear that the secondary school had accessed or understood the diagnostic assessment, the key bridge to visibility which Karen had pushed for, or that the staff understood the implications and advice. The experience was demoralising and distressing for Kevin, and also demonstrates how failure to properly identify and address need becomes disabling. Such superficial approaches to intervention in the form of accommodation in situ had long‐term impact, and created dependency at points where expressing independence and agency was a key social task. From the accounts Kevin could be inferred to be a child with good cognitive potential, but Karen revealed he was on track for grade 3 in his GCSE's (GCSE's are qualifications taken at age 16 at the end of secondary education, a pass being grade 4).

It was unsurprising, given the lack of autonomy and acquisition of age‐appropriate skill, that when environmental adaptions and sensitive teaching were removed by a change of teacher there was a rapid deterioration in Kevin's behaviour. Karen had previously noted in science ‘He was getting incredibly good grades’ and wanted to be an architect. However, she went on ‘He had a new teacher, and I had a call in the first week. Kevin was mucking around and not settling down and I was really shocked because he likes science and he felt he was good at it’. This account was useful in highlighting how vulnerable to relatively small changes in environment children with the dyslexia and neurodivergent profile are, and the degree to which they are out of step with their peers' level of agency and skill and the difficulty it causes them.

The interface between the child with their profile of differences and history, the environmental demands, the context and their combined impact on agency (including public agency) was an important analytical construct. Within this, the role of diagnosis was salient, and the lack of or non‐recognition generated adverse outcomes. This was exemplified by an exchange between Wendy and Vera, parents of 8‐ and 9‐year‐old children:

WENDY:Some people have teased him. There was one issue that I was furious with the school about because they had to go up for school councillor and they had half an hour to write something and stand up and read it out.

I:They all had to do it?

WENDY:No, you could volunteer and I couldn't believe that Wayne volunteered for it. He wrote it out and stood up and couldn't read his own words and everyone teased him. [..] he came home and sobbed [..] that was a big one. I was really cross with the school.

I:Poor poppet. […]

VERA:Vince wanted to go up for school council but as soon as he realised he had to write a statement, he said no.

It was seen in the data that if schools and their staff do not recognise dyslexia and do not accept the value of diagnosis (which this school apparently did not), the policies of inclusion and education become meaningless for children with the lived experience of dyslexia. But they also become a source of difficulty and stress for the family. Susan talked about the strain on her marriage as a result of Sarah's distress expressed at home and Karen recounted ‘his behaviour at home was awful as in tantrums, throwing himself on the floor, storming off and I've had to really work at that and be patient. Me and my partner have had a few squabbles over how to deal with that’. Schools are at risk of generating disabling and distressing environments. Even young children aged 6 were reported to physically withdraw, disengage and protect themselves from social damage.

It was not just pupils who withdrew, but also parents who recognised how hard and expensive dealing with a school or Local Authority could be; as Imogen commented, local policy would add another layer of difficulty. It is not surprising that it was only the most resilient of parents who secured support; other parents just gave up. In the extract below, Yvette, who had very challenging times with the school for her son (for whom she had been able to afford a diagnostic report), revealed that although her daughter's presentation of dyslexia was worse than her son's, no diagnosis had been made. The school had offered an assessment that she had ‘dyslexic tendencies’ (this was a term reported by many parents), but parental circumstances had changed, and she was not in a position to pay for support or endure that form of interaction again:

YVETTE:I don't really know, I've almost written off her primary years because from speaking to other parents everybody just says you'll see a massive change when you go to secondary school which is what's happened with Yves, and everyone says you just do not get the support in primary school, you've just got to get through it and then hope that things change when you get to, it sounds really defeatist when you actually say it out loud but I'm not, I'm just not expecting a lot from them.

Our analysis supports the interpretation that a failure to diagnose leaves substantial ambiguity and risk of harm across a child's education, leaving open the possibility of misattribution and misdirection. It supports the case that the visibility of the child and their needs is critical to ensuring effective intervention. It further supports the claim that the absence of detailed assessment by knowledgeable professionals is a barrier to avoiding preventable disability. However, for effective inclusion beyond the base level as described in the Göransson and Nilholm (2014) hierarchy to occur, staff need to be able to make use of assessment report information and also recognise the profile of strengths as referenced by parents in their account of the profile. This is also implied by the top of the hierarchy as a form of community by Göransson and Nilholm (2014). Dyslexia severity from these data appears significantly impacted by what happens between school and family. However, a diagnosis on its own does not resolve the issues; it is a tool to facilitate the process and recognition by the child, family and school.

The value of dyslexia diagnosis lies in the acknowledgment of it by those who can act on the information. In the case of Larry, who threw a chair across a classroom in frustration 5 months into his new school, his mother had paid for an assessment and had a diagnosis. The primary school ignored it until there was a change of SENCO. When he transferred to secondary school, she gave the report to the new school and met with the SENCO to discuss the support Larry needed. When Lucy followed up on the incident, she checked on all the support she had thought was in place ‘So then I said to her ‘so do all of his teachers know that he's dyslexic?’ ‘He's not dyslexic’. ‘Okay’ [said with alarm]. If you typed his name in to his student profile it just came up with a little picture of him, it didn't have anything, nothing’. Despite the meeting with the SENCO, the school had ignored the report and practical suggestions.

Although being able to name the difficulty allows for easy visibility, the account above outlines how important knowledge of the system is to ensure that legally required provision of support is applied. What matters is the evidence in the report and the education/legal system being activated via the SEND Code of Practice (Department of Education and Department of Health2015), not the name the profile is given. Yet many parents did not appreciate this, and schools and others with responsibility did not enlighten them. Oliver was a typical example:

OLIVER:So, we got that done and a statement done, went into secondary school.

I:So he actually got a statement.

OLIVER:Yeah you get a report back don't you, not a statement sorry, a report back with recommendations in there. He had, I can't think what you called it, the learning plan. Owen had that learning plan.

Oliver did not appreciate this had no legal weight and could not be enforced, and all that was offered was extra time in exams. As he recounted earlier, teachers still did not address observed need for his son and his emerging disability.

The data contained many accounts of avoidable disability with long‐term consequences. Some of this was very distressing to record, including details of an 8‐year‐old child attempting suicide, but fortunately not knowing how to do so effectively. In that case, the parent could not afford assessments, so need had not been properly described and defined, and in this ambiguity, it can be inferred that the school was taking a negative or even hostile view of the family. The impact on the child and parent was significant. The school refused to acknowledge parental concerns. There were observably marked literacy and learning difficulties and other co‐occurring difficulties. It was only later when the parent was able to access assistance to submit a request for a statutory needs assessment that the nature and extent of the child's difficulties were articulated. This led to a change of primary schools and improved provision. However, the proposed secondary school were resisting provision, so that the parent had to take the local authority to a tribunal, where they secured the help required. To do this, the parent had to pay for a full diagnostic assessment. With this latter assistance in place the young person did well enough to enter an apprenticeship program. The case highlights both the failures and damage that occurs when quality assessment is not undertaken and the positive impact on a young person's life trajectory when diagnosis and support are applied.

Looking at the themes and subthemes identified, it is unsurprising that the problems dyslexic children have are often unresolved through education. The work of Thompson (2021) laid out the complexity of the structural features and agency that shape the expression of dyslexia a child has. A critical part of that account was the level of visibility the children and parents had. In this paper, the issue of visibility has been considered in the context of a prevailing narrative of non‐recognition and non‐diagnosis. The wider subtext in the data is of how inclusion is perceived by educational systems and schools as reducing individual visibility and having a generic accommodation inclusive strategy. In particular, it has considered the harm inflicted on pupils and families with this approach. In the literature and in practice, it is argued that the first line of diagnosis is teacher assessment and intervention (Fuchs and Fuchs2006; Lynn et al.2015). This should be instigated at the first opportunity with quality interventions such as phonics (Department for Education2021). A child's responsiveness to good quality intervention can provide important information as to the nature of their difficulties (Rose2009). In some cases, appropriately intensive and well delivered early intervention can even avoid the need for full diagnostic assessment. However, even in an environment where high quality literacy tuition is the norm and intervention is provided at an early stage, there will remain some children with significant difficulties, and our investigation has indicated the significant negative consequences associated with minimising these difficulties. Further, one of the persistent findings across the data was the variability in teacher expertise to deliver on this strategy, leaving parents and children in a state of disarray. When parents did try to articulate their concerns, they often experienced dismissal, injustice and distress. Parental concerns have also been dismissed in the literature (Knight and Crick2021; Lauchlan and Boyle2020), which forms the academic narrative background of privileging teacher viewpoints, even with limited knowledge. The Göransson and Nilholm (2014) hierarchy does not speak to this narrow perspective. From the data, there was evidence where schools engaged with parents and the child's visibility was raised; the progress up the hierarchy of inclusion was more effective.

Parents sought diagnosis because their children were experiencing distress; literacy difficulties were an obvious focus and parents were looking for some form of explanatory framework which they could use to navigate the education system. Their expectations were that a diagnostic report would increase the visibility of their child's needs, and schools would then provide appropriate support for their child. They had poor appreciation of the support system and how to ensure the report translated into obligations of assistance. In that respect a diagnosis was a retort to the epistemic injustice they were experiencing. However, as noted previously and in Lucy's case, schools could simply ignore this. The analysis highlights that without good quality information typically found in diagnostic assessments and access to knowledgeable and responsive teachers, access to education was compromised. In school cultures that only consider surface needs and contextual adaptation without remediation, the lack of diagnostic information becomes a source of disability and disenfranchisement for the child with predictable potential negative lifelong consequences.

Within this context, the four real level themes derived from parents and teachers' accounts provide a framework for critical analysis of current education training, practices and policy, education delivery, impact and outcomes. Such visibility of the agency and structural features embedded and reflected in the real level themes and the actual level subthemes challenge the research and practice in the field as it currently is. This is with respect to both within and, importantly, post‐school life for a child, where reaching potential and inclusion is not classroom‐based but society‐based. In this respect, the work in the field of dyslexia has a wider impact for all children with Special Educational Needs. An important feature of this for children with a dyslexia‐type profile is early diagnosis, the value of diagnosis being recognised, and the mitigations at both individual and structural levels that can flow from this being applied.

It might seem from our data that there is an ‘unbridgeable gap’ between parent and teacher perspectives. However, we do not believe that this is the correct conclusion. Our argument is that the gap can be bridged, to a certain extent, by the effective and consistent use of diagnosis of dyslexia. In an imperfect system, a diagnosis acts as a bridge of common communication and understanding to make visible a child's profile of needs. This visibility is needed because of the multiple ways in which the dyslexic profile can impact upon life within and beyond school. We therefore argue there is an important role for diagnosis that goes beyond simply labelling a child.

Full adherence is imperative to ensure the prevention of unintended pregnancies, which have serious health and financial impacts on women. Previous research has identified the importance of cues (habit‐based) and providing information from a credible source (non‐habit‐based) in facilitating adherence.

A 6 week experiment was developed to increase adherence to the pill (primary outcome) as well as increase habit strength for taking the pill (secondary outcome).

A sample of Australians who menstruate (N= 77,Mage= 25.18,SD= 3.49) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: (1) a control group, (2) receiving information from a credible source, (3) implementing a daily cue, and (4) receiving both the information and instructions to implement a cue. At baseline and six‐weeks, participants completed two measures of adherence to the pill, and a measure of habit strength.

Mixed‐model ANOVAs revealed no significant changes in adherence to the pill across conditions, over time. There was a significant increase in habit strength over time (η2 = .11), across all conditions (η2 = .11). However, these changes did not significantly differ by condition (p= .071).

These findings suggest participating in an experiment, regardless of condition, may make taking the pill more salient and thus increase habit strength. It also suggests that providing information from a credible source nor associating taking the pill with a daily cue substantially increased adherence. However, adherence was positively skewed and therefore these findings need to be further explored with individuals with lower adherence.

What is already known on this subject?

Full adherence to the pill is rare, with 50% of users missing a dose of their pill at least once a month.

Information from a credible source, and habit have both been shown to improve adherence to medications.

What does this study add?

Providing information from a credible source increased habit strength for taking the pill more than cue associations.

Trying to change behaviour for a non‐novel behaviour is difficult.

Unintended pregnancies are a serious public health issue, with a 2022 report finding that unintended pregnancies are associated with financial and social impacts on women, employers, out‐of‐home carers and the Government (Organon & HTAnalysts,2022). They are also said to directly cost an estimated AUD $2.2 billion, with 91% of this being paid for by the Government and the remaining 9% paid by the women experiencing the unintended pregnancy (Organon & HTAnalysts,2022). In addition to the financial impacts, unintended pregnancies can negatively impact the woman, child and their families. For instance, a review of the literature found that unintended pregnancy was associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing adverse birth outcomes such as congenital anomalies, premature delivery and low birth weight (Gipson et al.,2008). Non‐adherence to the oral contraceptive pill is a large contributor to experiencing an unintended pregnancy, with some studies reporting that approximately 73% of women were actively taking the oral contraceptive pill when they experienced an unintended pregnancy (Coombe et al.,2016).

According to the United Nations (2019), the oral contraceptive pill (otherwise known as “the pill”) is one of the most widely used methods of contraception globally, with an estimated 151 million users. In Australia, approximately one‐third of women between 16 and 49 years currently take the pill as their main form of contraception (Richters et al.,2016). In addition, it is expected that nearly 80% of women will use the pill for contraception at some stage in their life (Richters et al.,2003). Full adherence1to the pill results in it being 99.7% effective at preventing pregnancy, however, with typical adherence (e.g., missing doses or not taking at the same time every day), the effectiveness of the pill is reduced to 91% (Trussell,2011). Studies have shown that full adherence (taking at the same time, every day) is rare, with approximately 50% of users missing or forgetting to take a dose of their pill at least once a month (Molloy et al.,2012; Rosenberg et al.,1998). Recent research suggests that one‐third of women unintentionally forgot to take their pill in the previous week (Fumero et al.,2021), which could lead to experiencing an unintended pregnancy. One way to possibly improve unintentional non‐adherence (Phillips et al.,2013) to the pill, and reduce the number of unintended pregnancies, may be through making the behaviour habitual.

Previous research in adherence has shown a significant positive association between habit strength and medication adherence (Badawy et al.,2020; Hoo et al.,2019; Liddelow et al.,2022). In other words, people who report a higher habit strength for taking the pill were also more likely to report better adherence (Murphy et al.,2018). More specifically, habit strength has been shown to be a strong predictor of unintentional non‐adherence (Phillips et al.,2013). There is an ongoing debate in the literature around what exactly defines a ‘habit’, with some experts believing that a habit is the outcome of a learnt cue‐behaviour association, how fast a behaviour becomes automatic or the cue‐behaviour association itself (Gardner,2015; Gardner et al.,2024; Wood & Rünger,2016). In line with social cognition theories (e.g., Temporal Self‐Regulation Theory; Hall & Fong,2007), and previous research that suggests that habit is a determinant of behaviour rather than a type of behaviour, (e.g., Gardner,2015; Gardner & Lally,2013; Phillips & Mullan,2023), we define habit as “a cognitive process whereby a contextual cue automatically triggers an impulse to act, based on a cue‐behaviour association learnt through consistent repetition in the presence of the cue” (Gardner et al.,2024, p.3). This consistent repetition is then said to lead to a habitual behaviour, which can then sometimes lead to the behaviour being maintained in the long‐term (Kwasnicka et al.,2016).

The importance of cues in predicting and assisting engagement in healthy and unhealthy behaviours has been shown in previous research, such as in everyday nutrition behaviours (Keller et al.,2021), binge drinking episodes (Murray & Mullan,2019), teeth flossing (Judah et al.,2013), and sugar‐sweetened beverage consumption (McAlpine & Mullan,2022). Cues were initially broadly classified into two domains: internal (e.g., wheezing) and external cues (e.g., media advertisements), however, more recently it has been proposed there are five domains: physical (e.g., media advertisement, alarm), sensory (e.g., certain smell), social (e.g., spending time with certain friends), internal (e.g., sleepiness), and emotional (e.g., feeling sad; Booker & Mullan,2013; Mullan & Novoradovskaya,2018).

More specifically, cues are often identified as being important in improving medication adherence, as reported in both qualitative studies (Kelly et al.,2014; Liddelow, Mullan, & Boyes,2020; Liddelow, Mullan, Boyes, & McBride,2020), and quantitative studies (Liddelow et al.,2021; Stawarz et al.,2016). The importance of cues in adherence to specific medications have also been experimentally explored, with promising results (Phillips et al.,2021; Rigsby et al.,2000; Rosen et al.,2004). However, further research into the role of cues using experimental research is warranted, to fully understand its ability to facilitate adherence behaviours to a range of different medications.

As full adherence to the pill is imperative to ensure its success in preventing pregnancy, exploring the possibility of pairing the pill with a daily cue may be a promising avenue to explore in attempts to make taking the pill a habitual behaviour, and in turn, improve adherence. However, research suggests that behaviours (such as taking medication) may be more difficult to become habitual if the reward for doing the behaviour is distal (Mullan & Novoradovskaya,2018; Phillips & Mullan,2023a). In the case of the pill, users may not experience the benefit of the pill unless they are engaging in sexual practices where the risk of becoming pregnant is high (e.g., not using physical protection such as a condom). Thus, taking the pill may be more difficult to become a habitual behaviour because the ‘benefit’ is not experienced immediately. Similarly, there has also been research that suggests that habit alone may not be sufficient for long‐term maintenance of behaviour change (Gardner et al.,2024; Lally & Gardner,2013), despite it being an important predictor of adherence (Phillips et al.,2013), and that other cognitive or more intentional processes may be important (Gardner,2015; Kwasnicka et al.,2016). Due to this, it is important to explore (and compare) processes by which adherence to the pill can be improved, and potentially maintained, that do not involve making the behavioural habitual.

One relatively easy mechanism to employ that is said to improve medication adherence is through educating individuals using credible sources and information. Having a greater level of understanding of medications and their usage is linked to greater adherence as it is said to motivate people to adhere (Al‐Qazaz et al.,2011; Horne & Weinman,1999; Mekonnen & Gelayee,2020). Research exploring this association with adherence to the pill has also shown that greater understanding of the pill, its uses, mechanisms of action and side effects are positively associated with better adherence and continuation of the pill (Hall et al.,2014; Liddelow, Mullan, & Boyes,2020). This supports research by Kwasnicka et al. (2016) who identified that social influences, such as having the correct skills and knowledge to effectively engage in a behaviour, can positively influence maintenance of the behaviour.

Furthermore, information provided about the oral contraceptive pill, whether in the form of a leaflet from a pharmaceutical company or spoken directly by a trained medical professional, often makes it explicit that for the pill to be the most effective, it must be taken at the same time every day (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,2019). This instruction may lead to engagement in planning strategies to assist them in adhering (Bandura,1997). This idea is in line with Lally and Gardner (2013) who outline the four stages of habit formation (i.e., intention formation, intention to action, repetition and cue‐response association). They suggest that an individual needs to translate their intention into action through the use of self‐regulatory tools, such as becoming more knowledgeable about a behaviour to sufficiently plan for it, before they can begin forming the habitual behaviour. In contrast, there is also research that suggests that education/knowledge alone is insufficient to lead to positive behaviour change (Arlinghaus & Johnston,2018), and that it needs to be paired with other behaviour change mechanisms. However, this has yet to be explicitly explored. Therefore, providing information from credible sources, such as a pharmaceutical company, as a mechanism for improving adherence and habit strength for the pill, lends itself to being further explored both as an individual mechanism and in combination with other mechanisms (i.e., cues).

The aim of this study was to experimentally explore two different mechanisms that were hypothesised to increase adherence to the pill, and increase habit strength, namely implementing a cue to pair with the behaviour, and providing information from a credible source. This experiment is explicitly targeting the implementation component of adherence, which is “the extent to which a patient's actual dosing corresponds to the prescribed dosing regimen, from initiation (the first dose) to discontinuation (the last dose)” (Vrijens et al.,2012, p. 696). Using a 4 (experimental condition) x 2 (time points, baseline and follow‐up) repeated measures design we recruited people who menstruate, and who self‐identified as not very good at remembering to take the pill (i.e., unintentionally non‐adhering) and randomised them to one of four conditions and measured their adherence over 6 weeks. Each condition provided specific behaviour change techniques (Abraham & Michie,2008; Michie et al.,2011) based on the behavioural mechanisms of change of the key variables (i.e., habit strength and education/knowledge). The design of this study is based on a recent successful experiment that aimed to increase the use of reusable coffee cups (Novoradovskaya et al.,2020), which can also be considered a distal reward behaviour (i.e., the reward is in the future rather than immediate; Mullan & Novoradovskaya,2018) like that of taking the pill. The four different conditions in the experiment are: (i) control group, (ii) information only group, (iii) cue implementation only group, and (iv) information + cue implementation group.

Subsequently, it was hypothesised:

Based on research suggesting that habit strength is associated with better adherence (Liddelow et al.,2022), and with the assumption that our sample who self‐identifies as not being very good at remembering to take the pill (i.e., unlikely to have a high habit strength for the behaviour), there will be a positive association between pill habit strength and adherence at follow‐up.

Based on research that suggests education/knowledge alone is not enough to change behaviour (Arlinghaus & Johnston,2018), participants who match their pill‐taking behaviour with their choice of a daily cue (cue implementation only group, and combined group) will report a greater increase in habit strength and adherence over time compared to the groups without a cue (control group, and information only group).

It is expected that at the end of 6 weeks, there will have been an increase in the primary outcome variable (adherence to the pill) and the secondary outcome variable (habit) in all three experimental conditions, but not the control group.

The control group were provided with no experimental content and were simply instructed to take their pill at the same time every day as per the usual instructions given by their health professional.

The information only group was provided with a standardized and general Consumer Medicine Information leaflet (see DataS1andS3) from a credible and common pharmaceutical company in Australia, much like the ones already provided in the packet/box. These leaflets provide the consumer with information regarding how the pill works, how to take it correctly, any potential side effects, and what to do if a dose is missed. A Consumer Medicine Information leaflet was provided for both the combination pill and the progestogen‐only pill (mini‐pill), and participants randomized to this group were instructed to select the one that matched their current pill type to ensure they were receiving the correct information. Participants were instructed to try and take their pill for the next 6 weeks according to the information in the leaflet. The content provided to this group (as part of the leaflet) used three behaviour change techniques, coded in the behaviour change technique taxonomy as ‘4.1 instruction on how to perform the behaviour’, ‘5.1 information about health consequences’, and ‘9.1 credible source’ (Michie et al.,2013).

Participants in this group were provided with a definition of a cue and asked to spend a few minutes thinking of a cue they can match with taking their pill to assist them in remembering each day. Participants were told the cue must be something they do every day (i.e., an action‐based cue) and were provided with examples, such as ‘placing your pill box on your bedside table so you see it every morning when you wake up, acting as a reminder to take your pill’. Participants were instructed to write down their chosen cue and ensure they take their pill when they experience this cue, in the chosen context, for the next 6 weeks. The content provided used three behaviour change techniques, coded in the behaviour change technique taxonomy as ‘7.1 prompts/cues’, ‘8.1 behavioural practice/rehearsal’, and ‘8.3 habit formation’ (Michie et al.,2013).

Participants in the combined information and cue implementation group received the same material from groups 2 and 3. Participants were instructed to read the general Consumer Medicine Information leaflet for their specific pill (i.e., either the Mini‐pill or combination pill) and asked to choose a cue to assist them to take their pill every day (preferably at the same time). The order the content was presented to participants was not randomized (see DataS2for detailed instructions provided to each experimental group). The content provided to this group used the six behaviour change techniques mentioned previously.

Ana‐priori power analysis was conducted in G*Power (Faul et al.,2007) to see the minimum number of participants needed to detect a small‐medium effect size (f= 0.25; based on meta‐analysis findings from Conn and Ruppar (2017)) using a repeated measures within‐between ANOVA, withα= .05, power = 0.80, four groups and two‐time points, a minimum sample size of 48 (12 per group) was needed. However, accounting for at least 30% attrition, we aimed to recruit 80 participants in total (20 per group). Participants were required to be living in Australia, between the ages of 16 and 35 years (i.e., peak reproductive years for most women), currently taking the pill for contraception (prevention of pregnancy) and self‐perceived themselves as not very good at remembering to take the pill (i.e., unintentionally non‐adherent).

Adherence to the pill at both baseline and follow‐up was measured using two different self‐report measures, as previous research has identified different measures of adherence measure different things, such as attitudes/beliefs or actual behaviour, and thus perform differently in research (Liddelow et al.,2021).

The five‐item Medication Adherence Report Scale is a widely used measure of adherence. It contains five questions related to medication‐taking over the previous 2 weeks (as is typical for this measure), that are summed. For example, “I forgot to take a dose of my pill”, all of which are answered on a 5‐point Likert scale ranging from 1 = never to 5 = always. All items are reversed scored such that higher scores indicate better adherence. This measure showed adequate internal consistency in this sample (α= .71 at follow‐up to .74 at baseline).

The second measure of adherence was an adapted version of the Timeline Follow‐Back which has previously been used in studies of medication adherence (Liddelow et al.,2021). This measure of adherence is presented in a calendar‐like form to prompt participants to recall their previous week and to think about each day individually. Participants are instructed to enter the day and date, starting from the day before and working backwards. They are also asked to enter any special events that may have occurred on these individual days. The next two parts ask participants to indicate whether they took their pill on that day by entering a Y (for yes) or an N (for no). The final row of the measure asks participants if, on that day, they took their pill as prescribed (typically, at the same time every day) by entering a Y or N. If participants did not take their pill that day, a response of N is expected. Participants received a total adherence score out of 14 (one score for each day taking the pill and another score if the pill was taken correctly), with higher scores indicating better adherence over the previous week. If participants did not take their pill on an individual day, they automatically got zero for that day. A timeframe of 1 week is used for this measure as this is how the measure has typically been applied in previous medication adherence‐related research (Liddelow et al.,2021).

Habit strength was measured using the Self‐Report Habit Index (Verplanken & Orbell,2003). This measure is the most widely used measure of habit strength and consists of the prompt “Ensuring I take my oral contraceptive pill correctly is something…” followed by 12 statements such as “…I do frequently” and “I do without thinking”. Participants were asked to select how much they agree or disagree with each statement on a 7‐point Likert scale from 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree. The scores from each item were combined and the mean score calculated. Higher mean scores indicated a higher habit strength for taking the pill. This measure showed good to excellent internal consistency in this sample (α= .89 at baseline to .93 at follow‐up).

Participants were asked to complete 11 demographic questions, most of which related to which type of pill they were currently taking, how long they have been on the pill, whether they were sexually active, had previous pregnancies and/or children, and their use of emergency contraception. General demographics such as age, gender identity, education and ethnicity were also collected.

Advertisements for participation in the study were placed on social media sites such as Facebook (i.e., public Australian‐based groups such as community/neighbourhood groups), Twitter, and Reddit (i.e., research forums), between May and September 2020. Advertisements consisted of a digital poster and a brief paragraph outlining the purpose of the study and inclusion criteria (e.g., are you a woman below the age of 35 and currently take the oral contraceptive pill for contraception but are not very good at remembering to take it?), accompanied by a link for participants to click if they required more information or were interested in participating. If interested, participants were directed to an online Qualtrics survey where they were presented with the participation information sheet. This sheet did not detail the content of the four groups, meaning participants were blind to the specific experimental groups prior to being randomized. After reading the participant information sheet, participants were asked to give informed consent by checking a box. If they did not check this box, they were unable to continue the study and were thanked for their time.

Upon providing informed consent, participants entered their email address. and created a unique code to assist in linking their baseline and follow‐up responses. After this, participants were screened against the key inclusion criteria and asked to report their age (in years), whether they currently take the oral contraceptive pill, and whether they take the pill mainly for contraception (rather than other gynaecological issues). Eligible participants then completed all baseline measures, which took no longer than 20 minutes, and were then randomly assigned to one of the four groups using the built‐in random number generator setting in Qualtrics. The Qualtrics randomiser setting monitors the randomisation to ensure participants are allocated based on a 1:1 ratio, but in a random order. Participants in the combined information + cue implementation group were asked to read the Consumer Medicine Information leaflet and then to spend a few minutes thinking about a cue. This was presented in the same order each time.

After completing the baseline survey and being randomized, participants were instructed to follow the advice they had been given for the next 6 weeks. After the 6 weeks had elapsed, participants were sent an email asking them to complete the follow‐up, with a link to the online Qualtrics survey (same measures as baseline). No reminders were sent to participants after this initial email. At no stage were participants debriefed or provided information relating to the other experimental groups. Participants who fully completed both parts were placed in a prize draw to win 1 of 5 shopping vouchers valued at $50 AUD each. The Curtin University Human Research Ethics Committee approved the study (2020–0158).

The data collected at both time points were combined and analysed using SPSS (IBM Corp,2021). To ensure the data was appropriate for the planned main analyses (i.e., mixed‐model ANOVAs), several assumptions were checked prior to running any analyses. All assumptions were met, except for normality for both measures of adherence (i.e., Shapiro–Wilk test wasp< .001 for both measures of adherence at both timepoints). Boxplots also indicated the presence of extreme outliers on both measures of adherence. Subsequently, cases identified as being extreme outliers were removed from the analysis (n= 4), however, it did not significantly improve the normality of the data. Both log and square root transformations of the two adherence variables was also trialled, but both also did not significantly improve the data. It is not uncommon for adherence assessed by self‐report measures to be typically highly skewed towards full adherence (e.g., Kleppe et al.,2015; Tommelein et al.,2014). Currently, there is no agreed‐upon way to overcome this limitation of the research area and therefore we continued with the planned analyses, with the extreme outliers excluded. To explore possible differences in key baseline demographics (age, type of pill, length of time using, number of children and education level) and the outcome variables (adherence and habit strength) between those who completed both time points and those who did not, Chi‐Square Test of Contingencies and independent samplest‐tests were used. To investigate whether randomisation was successful, a one‐way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was conducted on the same key demographic and outcome variables. Spearman rank correlation coefficients (ρ) were conducted to assess the relationships between key demographic variables (age, type of pill, length of time using, number of children and education level) and the primary outcome (adherence) and the secondary outcome (habit strength) variables at both baseline and follow‐up.

For the main analysis, three mixed‐model ANOVAs were used to test for changes in the primary (adherence) and secondary (habit strength) outcomes over time. The experimental group (i.e., control, information only, cue implementation only, and information + cue implementation) was the between‐subjects factor, with participants randomised to only one of the four conditions. Time (baseline and follow‐up scores on the primary and secondary outcomes) was the repeated measures factor. The group x time interaction tested if there were any condition‐related differences on the primary and secondary outcomes over time. If required, for significant group x time interactions, appropriate planned comparisons tested differences between all four conditions at the two‐time points, as well as differences over time within each condition.

Initially, 358 participants responded to the advertising material, however, 225 of these did not complete the baseline questionnaire and thus were not randomized to a group. This left a total of 153 participants who completed the baseline questionnaire and were randomized to a group. A total of 72 participants did not complete the follow‐up, with two of these not supplying an email address to be contacted to receive the link to the follow‐up. A total of 81 participants completed both time points, however, 4 participants had their data removed due to being extreme outliers. This left a total of 77 participants whose data was subsequently used in the analysis (see Figure1for a flow chart of participants). There were no significant differences between completers of both time points and non‐completers on any demographics or key variables at baseline assessment.



Flow Chart of Participants.

Of those that completed both parts (N= 77), all participants identified as biologically female and their ages ranged between 18 and 34 years (Mage= 25.18,SD= 3.49). The sample was highly educated with 72.7% (n= 56) having a bachelor's degree or higher. A total of 87.0% (n= 67) of the sample identified as Caucasian. The majority 83.1% (n= 64) reported currently using the combined pill (one‐month cycle), 11.7% (n= 9) using the combined pill (13 weeks cycle) and the remaining 5.2% (n= 4) were currently using the progestin‐only pill, or the ‘mini‐pill’. The length of time taking the pill ranged from 2 months to 16 years (M= 7.13 years,SD= 4.18), with 67.5% (n= 52) having been recommended the pill by their General Physician or Gynaecologist. Only 7.8% (n= 6) of participants had children and 18.2% (n= 14) reported ever being pregnant. Just over half of the sample, 51.9% (n= 40) reported having ever used emergency contraception. See Table1for the baseline demographic characteristics of each group and overall.

Overall, participants reported reasonably high adherence at baseline, particularly when using the Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS‐5) withM= 22.91 out of a possible 25. Adherence, as measured by the Timeline Follow‐Back, indicates that, on average, participants are adherent between 4 and 5 days a week. However, habit strength overall was average withM= 3.93 out of a possible 7.

We compared the means of key variables at baseline for each of the four different groups using a one‐way ANOVA. No significant differences between groups were identified on age, number of children, habit strength, or either of the measures of adherence to the pill. We also compared differences in categorical demographic variables (type of pill, ethnicity, and education level) and found no significant differences between the groups.

Spearman Rank correlations were computed to assess the strength of the association between the main variables of interest (see Table2). No demographic variables were significantly correlated with adherence or habit strength at both baseline or follow‐up. At follow‐up, there were significant positive correlations between habit strength for taking the pill and adherence using both measures; Medication Adherence Report Scale (ρ= .481,p< .001) and the Timeline Follow‐Back (ρ= .452,p< .001).

A significant main effect for time was not identifiedF(1, 73) = 0.00,p= .991, partialη2 = .00 meaning there was no change in adherence to the pill over time using this measure. There was also no significant main effect of group identifiedF(3, 73) = 1.01,p= .395, partialη2 = .04, and no significant interaction between time and groupF(3, 73) = 1.87,p= .143, partialη2 = .07. This suggests that adherence to the pill did not significantly increase in all groups over time.

The main effect of time was not significantF(1, 62) = 0.38,p= .542, partialη2 = .01, and a significant main effect for group was also not identifiedF(3, 62) = 1.32,p= .275, partialη2 = .06. A non‐significant interaction between time and group was also reportedF(3, 62) = 2.19,p= .098, partialη2 = .10, such that adherence to the pill did not significantly increase in all groups over time.

A significant main effect for time was identifiedF(1, 73) = 8.99,p= .004, partialη2 = .11. A significant main effect for group was also identifiedF(3, 73) = 2.88,p= .042, partialη2 = .11. However, a significant interaction between time and group was not identified,F(3, 73) = 2.44,p= .071, partialη2 = .09, such that habit strength significantly increased over time across all groups, but the changes over time did not significantly differ across the groups. Examination of the means indicated that the information only group reported the largest change in habit strength from baseline (M= 4.07,SD= 1.01) to follow‐up (M= 4.99,SD= 1.37). The control group reported the smallest change in habit strength from baseline (M= 3.72,SD= 1.14) to follow‐up (M= 3.79,SD= 1.01). See Table4for the descriptive statistics of each group at both time points for all the outcome variables.

To explore whether findings related to habit stays true when using a different measure of habit, the Self‐Report Behavioural Automaticity Index (SRBAI; Gardner et al.,2012), the mixed‐model ANOVA analyses were repeated. This measure contains four items from the original Self‐Report Habit Index, all of which focus on the automaticity of habit (rather than the frequency). The items are measured the same as in the original measure.

A 4 (experimental condition) x 2 (time) mixed‐model ANOVA was conducted to assess the change in SRBAI habit strength between the four different groups over time. A significant effect for time was identifiedF(1, 73) = 8.75,p= .004, partialη2 = .11. No significant main effect for group was identifiedF(3, 73) = 2.18,p= .082, partialη2 = .08. In addition, no significant main effect for the interaction between time and group was identified,F(3, 73) = 1.77,p= .160,η2 = .068 suggesting that automaticity significantly increased over time across all groups, but the changes over time did not significantly differ between the groups.

A six‐week repeated‐measures experiment was conducted to improve adherence to the pill. Two different mechanisms, namely cues and information from a credible source, were hypothesised to improve medication adherence and habit strength. The findings supported our first hypothesis, with habit strength and adherence being significantly positively associated at follow‐up. Hypotheses two was not supported as all experimental groups, including those that did not receive the cue implementation, increased their habit strength over time, and there were no significant differences in this increase between the groups. Finally, hypothesis three was not supported as there were no significant increases in the primary outcome (adherence to the pill) between the three experimental groups over time. Contrary to our hypothesis, habit strength increased across all groups (including the control group) over time.

There were no significant effects identified on either measure of the primary outcome of medication adherence. This suggests the experiment was unsuccessful in changing behaviour. One possibility for this is the chosen behaviour was not a novel behaviour for the participants and thus it was more difficult to elicit changes in behaviour as participants were already in their own routines (Mergelsberg et al.,2020). This aligns with experimental cue implementation studies that found significant improvements in behaviour when the behaviour was novel, such as microwaving a dishcloth to reduce cross‐contamination (Keller et al.,2021; Mergelsberg et al.,2020). Another possible reason why the experiment was unsuccessful in changing adherence behaviour was while sufficiently powered based on the power analysis, it may have been underpowered to detect any significant effects given the ceiling effect in both adherence measures. This lack of variation in adherence is not uncommon, with several studies reporting the same issue yet for other medications (Kleppe et al.,2015; Tommelein et al.,2014). Therefore, replicating the experiment with population of less adherent participants is warranted to either prove or disprove the current findings. It is also possible that participants in the study believed they were poor at adhering to the pill for reasons that were not addressed in the experiment. For example, participants may have had issues with motivation (e.g., not having regular intercourse so did not see the purpose of taking the pill) that influenced their unintentional adherence. As such, participating in this study and receiving any of the conditions was unlikely to improve their behaviour as their main barrier was not addressed. Research shows that motivational barriers need to be addressed before adherence or habit strength will improve (Horne & Weinman,1999; Verplanken & Wood,2006). Nonetheless, full adherence to the pill is still required to ensure the greatest benefits and protection against unintentional pregnancy (Teal & Edelman,2021), and further studies addressing ways to improve adherence are still required.

Neither the use of a cue nor providing information was able to significantly change behaviour. Common behaviour change techniques aimed to change behaviour were included, however, only changes in the secondary outcome, habit, were identified. One possible explanation for why cues did not elicit significant changes in behaviour may be due to the types of cues participants selected to use. Although participants were not required to report the cue they chose, the example in the instructions provided to participants stated that the cue was ‘to be something they do every day’ (i.e., an action‐based cue). This recommendation was based on previous research by Stawarz et al. (2016) who found that contextual cues, such as routine events, locations and meaningful objects, were more effective than time‐based cues. However, it may be possible that for this specific group, contextual cues are not effective and other types of cues may be (e.g., time‐based, sensory‐based). However, future research is needed to compare the effects of using various types of cues in improving adherence behaviours. Nonetheless, this is an interesting finding and suggests that habit may be an underlying mechanism for adherence to the oral contraceptive pill. This aligns with previous research that has shown habit strength is a predictor of adherence to medications more broadly (Liddelow et al.,2022; Phillips et al.,2013). It also suggests that cue implementation and information from credible sources may provide a basis for strengthening habit rather than for strengthening behavioural engagement.

The findings showed a significant positive association between habit strength for taking the pill at follow‐up and adherence using both measures. This is consistent with recent research which has found an association between habit and medication adherence generally (Badawy et al.,2020) and more specifically to the pill (Murphy et al.,2018). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that all groups experienced an increase in their habit strength from baseline to follow‐up, which has also been shown in other studies that use mechanisms of habit formation (Bartle et al.,2019; Rompotis et al.,2014). This finding suggests that simply participating in an experiment can increase good habits, regardless of the condition.

Interestingly, all groups in the experiment, including the control group, reported increases in their habit strength. However, no group saw greater increases than another. This suggests that providing non‐habit‐based content still has the capacity to strengthen habit (Gardner et al.,2023). However, our sample was highly educated and thus likely to have higher levels of health literacy (Adams et al.,2009; Heijmans et al.,2015), which is the ability to find, understand and use health information (Sørensen et al.,2012). Therefore, it appears that in a highly educated population, providing information from credible sources can increase habit strength for a healthy behaviour, but not actually increase engagement in the behaviour. Studies for similar behaviours should therefore consider the use of fact sheets and if medication‐related, Consumer Medicine Information leaflets.

Furthermore, habit strength increased across all conditions, including the control group. This finding is contrary to what was hypothesised as changes in habit strength were only expected in the experimental groups. The control group were instructed to ‘take their pill at the same time every day as per the usual instructions given by their health professional’. Despite this instruction likely being the same as what they were told when first prescribed the pill (i.e., treatment as usual), perhaps this instruction and re‐iteration of what is already known acted as a reminder to participants and thus yielded some change in the habitual behaviour of the participants. Future research may consider being more subjective with the instructions provided to the control group/s. However, despite these changes in habit strength, they did not translate into behaviour change. One possibility is that although habit strength increased, it may not have been enough for the behaviour to become ‘habitual’ and thus actually influenced by habit. According to Lally and colleagues (Lally et al.,2010), a habit can take anywhere from 18 to 254 days to form, and a more recent study found it takes a median of 59 days (8 weeks) for a behaviour to reach peak automaticity (Keller et al.,2021). The findings of the sensitivity analysis using the four‐item Self‐Report Behavioural Automaticity Index (Gardner et al.,2012) support this finding by suggesting that automaticity also did not improve in any groups over time. As the pill is a distal benefit behaviour and the benefits of taking it are not experienced immediately (Mullan & Novoradovskaya,2018), it may take longer for the behaviour to become habitual. Future research should consider extending the experimental period from 6 weeks to perhaps 24 weeks, to explore whether this increased measurement time sees more significant changes in habit strength, specifically automaticity, and subsequently adherence to the pill. Conversely, given that participants were already taking the pill for some time, they likely already had some sort of routine for taking the pill, and thus a degree of ‘habit’, which may have been disrupted by this study. According to Graybiel and Smith (2014) whilst one habit may be able to replace another, the initial habit can never be truly ‘broken’. Therefore, future research may consider targeting those who are only just beginning to use the oral contraceptive pill or asking participants to identify their current pill‐taking habit and focus on a way to strengthen it (i.e., setting a timer to ensure they follow through with taking the pill after their evening meal).

The study is not without its limitations. Firstly, adherence at baseline (and follow‐up) in all groups was reasonably highly skewed and this may explain the lack of significant effects; there was not enough room for positive improvement, despite the need for full adherence when taking the pill. Studies in the future should consider other avenues for recruiting participants that may not be as good at adhering to their medication or are only just beginning to use the pill. Secondly, the use of self‐report measures, especially for variables that are deemed to occur in the unconscious, such as habit (Hagger et al.,2015; Sniehotta & Presseau,2012), has been contested (Gardner et al.,2023) and therefore the accuracy of the results may be limited. Similarly, self‐report medication adherence measures may be open to reporting and social biases (Stirratt et al.,2015), and are often met with highly positively skewed results (Kleppe et al.,2015), but they were the optimal choice for this study given its online nature, their ease of use, and the ability to collect data without being face‐to‐face. The findings also need to be interpreted with caution given the skewness of the outcome variables. Thirdly, including a measure of oral contraceptive pill knowledge at each time point, or recording the amount of time participants spent reading the leaflet, may have given additional insight into the mechanisms of change within the experiment. It would have also highlighted whether participants read and/or engaged with the Consumer Medicine Information leaflet. Similarly, the information only group was provided a leaflet that is already included with many prescription medications in Australia. As such, this group could be considered to be a second control group rather than an experimental group. However, future research is needed to truly understand the rates at which these leaflets are read/engaged with as whilst it may be provided, it may not be read. Finally, participants were not asked to report the cue that they chose, meaning we were unable to examine whether participants (i) understood the instructions correctly, or (ii) selected an appropriate cue. Therefore, it is unknown whether participants in the Cue Implementation Only and the Information + Cue Implementation group effectively engaged in a cue‐based approach. It is recommended that future research has participants report their cue to ensure instructions were followed as intended and consider providing alternative examples of action‐based cues in the instructions to participants to ensure they fully understand the types of cues they can use.

The current study was unsuccessful in eliciting changes in adherence to the pill, such that providing information from a credible source nor associating taking the pill with a daily cue substantially increased adherence. However, all groups in the experiment, including the control group, reported increases in their habit strength. However, no group saw greater increases than another. The findings suggest that none of the BCTs included in the study were successful in changing behaviour, but rather only the underlying mechanisms of the behaviour (e.g., habit). However, adherence was positively skewed and therefore the findings need to be considered with this in mind. Nonetheless, full adherence to the pill is imperative to ensure the highest effectiveness against unintended pregnancies, and therefore more studies are needed to investigate how to improve adherence to this medication.

The term ‘perfect adherence’ is often used when describing adherence to the oral contraceptive pill (e.g., Coombe et al.,2016). However, we feel this term has a value judgement attached to it. Therefore, throughout the manuscript ‘perfect adherence’ will instead be referred to as ‘full adherence’.

We examine how the seemingly arbitrary way a prompt is posed, which we term “prompt architecture,” influences responses provided by large language models (LLMs). Five large-scale, full-factorial experiments performing standard (zero-shot) similarity evaluation tasks using GPT-3, GPT-4, and Llama 3.1 document how several features of prompt architecture (order, label, framing, and justification) interact to produce methodological artifacts, a form of statistical bias. We find robust evidence that these four elements unduly affect responses across all models, and although we observe differences between GPT-3 and GPT-4, the changes are not necessarily for the better. Specifically, LLMs demonstrate both response-order bias and label bias, and framing and justification moderate these biases. We then test different strategies intended to reduce methodological artifacts. Specifying to the LLM that the order and labels of items have been randomized does not alleviate either response-order or label bias, and the use of uncommon labels reduces (but does not eliminate) label bias but exacerbates response-order bias in GPT-4 (and does not reduce either bias in Llama 3.1). By contrast, aggregating across prompts generated using a full factorial design eliminates response-order and label bias. Overall, these findings highlight the inherent fallibility of any individual prompt when using LLMs, as any prompt contains characteristics that may subtly interact with a multitude of hidden associations embedded in rich language data.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models and tools, in particular large language models (LLMs) such as GPT (generative pre-trained transformer), are rapidly disrupting many industries and fields of study, with many scientists and practitioners actively contemplating the use of LLMs as a substitute for humans in a wide range of tasks and occupations [1–11]. At first glance, LLMs seem particularly well-suited for some of the more tedious tasks typically performed by humans, such as combing through hordes of textual data and evaluating these data on various dimensions. LLMs have extensive memory and processing abilities, are presumably not influenced by emotions or moods, and never lack motivation.

As generative AI continues to gain traction, however, researchers are cautioning against hasty and indiscriminate use because these models tend to perpetuate pernicious social stereotypes and prejudices that may be embedded in the content on which they are trained. For example, due to co-occurrences in their corpora, LLMs may reveal gender stereotypes, such as perceiving a “nurse” more as a “woman” and a “doctor” more as a “man” [12–14]. As such, important ongoing work has begun developing tools for detecting and addressing this type of bias in the content created by LLMs [15–17].

In this article, we complement work that defines bias as “the predisposition or inclination toward a particular group (based on gender or race), often rooted in social stereotypes, that can unduly influence the representation or treatment of particular groups” [16] by focusing onmethodological artifacts, or biases due to the specificities of a given task design. Methodological artifacts are a form of statistical bias, as they are systematic errors that lead to conclusions that are partly “a result of the particular research technique employed, rather than an accurate representation of the world” [18]. Using a choice architecture framework, we examine how arbitrary associations embedded in the rich language data used to train LLMs may induce statistical bias (and, therefore, errors) in output.

We propose that prompt architecture biases LLM evaluations similarly to how the context of a choice biases human judgment [19–23]. We define “prompt architecture” as the seemingly arbitrary way a prompt is posed, such as the order of options in a prompt and the framing of a prompt. For example, managers (researchers) interested in replacing their workforce (human subjects) with generative AI may ask GPT to evaluate the similarity between different sets of items. They also need to decide how to label each set in the prompts they submit to GPT, the order in which to list the sets, and how to word the exact task. For example, a user may decide to write the prompt: “Is Set B or Set C closer to Set A?” Evaluative tasks such as these, with multiple choices that are ordered and labeled, span many different LLM use cases, including diagnoses [9,11], opinion polls and surveys [2,3], and social science experiments [5,7,8].

When only one prompt is used in these evaluation tasks, the implicit assumption is that GPT operates under the normative principle of procedure invariance, revealing a stable and reliable measure of similarity between options regardless of response order, labeling, framing, or justification (i.e., asking for reasons). In support of this assumption, GPT claims “my answer will only be driven by the actual items in each set. The order or labels of the sets will not influence my answer” (S1 Fig). Contrary to this claim, we find that the arbitrary architecture of the prompt (i.e., order, label, framing, and justification) systematically and significantly biases the output of LLMs, rendering the results from LLMs prone to methodological artifacts [18]. In other words, without taking this form of bias into account, a user may erroneously conclude that set A is closer to set B, candidate 1 is more qualified than candidate 2, or diagnosis I is more likely than diagnosis II, simply because of the architecture of the prompt.

Contemporaneous work in computer science and medicine offers preliminary support of our proposition that the architecture of the prompt may affect LLM responses. For example, research finds that the order of options in multiple-choice questions affects LLMs’ answers [24–27] and that this bias can be exacerbated when the task becomes more difficult [24]. Research also finds that the responses provided by LLMs are subject to the labels given to multiple-choice options [28–30]. Moreover, nascent work documents that prompt wording can influence LLM judgment. For example, Arroyo et al. [31] find that the performance of LLMs on tasks such as mortality prediction vary based on slight differences in the wording of the instructions.

We present a unifying theory of prompt architecture that can explain this work and expand on it, by framing it within a broader type of methodological artifacts to which LLMs are vulnerable. To test this, we design a full factorial experiment to systematically examine and disentangle the impact of multiple elements of prompt architecture. Specifically, in addition to order and labeling [32], we test two other classic choice architectural elements demonstrated in psychology—framing [33] and justification [34,35]—and examine how these elements interact with order and label bias within the same prompt. Mirroring findings in choice architecture, we find robust evidence that order, label, framing, and justification affect LLM responses. In particular, we uncover response-order and label bias and demonstrate how framing and justification affect these biases. We also test strategies to mitigate the methodological artifacts elicited by prompt architecture. We find that the use of uncommon labels reduces (but does not eliminate) label bias but exacerbates response-order bias for GPT-4 (it does not reduce either bias in Llama 3.1) and that specifying to the LLM that the order and labels of the items have been randomized does not alleviate either response-order or label bias in GPT-4 or Llama 3.1. By contrast, aggregating across prompt architectures generated using a full factorial design eliminates response-order and label bias. Although developing a full factorial design each time a user prompts a LLM may be impractical, the benefits likely outweigh the costs for decisions where bias is particularly harmful, such as in hiring or diagnoses. In addition, such factorial design may be implemented automatically (and potentially in a way that is transparent to the end user) by developing simple applications that generate the design and run it on the API.

By demonstrating the effect of different prompt architecture elements on LLM output, we hope to reorganize the emerging literature which has narrowly focused on the effect of specific elements of order or labeling under the umbrella of prompt architecture. Specifically, choice architecture argues that “there is no such thing as a neutral design” [19]. Similarly, there is no such thing as a neutral prompt: inherent in any individual prompt is an arbitrary architecture that includes order, labeling, framing, and a host of other characteristics that may subtly impact LLM output. As a result, “prompt engineering,” which typically attempts to identify one optimal prompt for a given task, may be a futile exercise. We suggest that rather than attempting to remove bias, users aggregate across different prompts, canceling out random and unpredictable noise due to the architecture of any individual prompt [36].

Our main test uses the application programming interface (API) of GPT-4 to perform a large number of evaluations. For replicability and because the behavior of GPT-4 keeps evolving [37], we pinned GPT-4 to its 06/13/2023 version (accessed 02/12/2024; the 06/13 version was the latest pinned version that was not in “preview” mode as of January 2024). We set temperature to 0 to obtain GPT-4’s most probable answer to each prompt. Borrowing from a standard psychology task [38], we show GPT-4 three sets of items (e.g., three sets of five countries) and ask whether the second or third set is closer to the first. This type of task is described as zero-shot because we do not provide any training example in the prompt. For a given triplet {Set1, Set2, Set3}, our experimental design has 32 conditions, in a 2^5 full factorial design (Table 1 for a summary of the conditions,Fig 1for an example of the task, andS1 Filefor more detail).



In this example sets are described using letters, ordered as A, B, C, and we ask for the closer set without an explanation.

First, we vary whether the prompt describes the sets using letters (A, B, C) or symbols (#, %, *). We examined both letter and symbol labels to test whether letters produce additional label bias, as they (i) possess an inherent order (i.e., the alphabet) and (ii) could be more frequently present in the training set in ways that might create extraneous associations given that letter labeling is a common practice. Second, we independently vary order by swapping the second and third labels (A, B, C vs. A, C, B or #, %, * vs. #, *, %) and the second and third sets (123 or 132). For example, the same triplet labeled with letters would be presented in four different ways (A. Set 1,B. Set 2,C. Set 3;A. Set 1,C. Set 2,B. Set 3;A. Set 1,B. Set 3,C. Set 2;A. Set 1,C. Set 3,B. Set 2). This is a full factorial design in which each set has one instance of each order and label combination, which allows us to test for statistical bias because we experimentally manipulate order and label independent of the actual content of the set. As a result, any impact of order and/or label is definitionally biased and does not reflect a real difference between sets. Third, to examine other elements of the prompt architecture, we vary the framing by asking GPT-4 either which set iscloserto the first set or which set isfartheraway [33]. Finally, following work on justification [34,35], we vary whether we ask GPT-4 to justify its answer.

We employ stimuli sampling and generate stimuli across six different categories (e.g., countries) borrowed from prior research [16], with 30 different triplets {Set1, Set2, Set3} in each category (S2 Filefor more detail on the stimuli generation). In sum, our experimental design generates 5,760 observations: 6 categories × 30 triplets per category × 32 prompts per triplet.

Of the 5,760 observations, GPT-4 failed to complete the task 313 times (5.43% failure rate). We removed these observations to obtain our final dataset of 5,447 observations.

Given full randomization, an unbiased responder should select the first option 50% of the time and any specific label 50% of the time. Instead, we find evidence that GPT-4 is prone to response-order and label bias. On average, across all observations, GPT-4 selected the first option in 63.21% of the cases (p<.001) and selected B over C in 74.27% of the cases (p<.001).Fig 2aand2bbreak down these biases by condition. Across condition, we consistently find response-order bias and lettered-label bias. In contrast with labeling with letters, we find that label bias is reduced, but not completely eliminated, when using symbols: the symbol % is chosen over the symbol * in 54.16% of the cases (vs. 63.21% of “B” for letters,p<.01;Fig 2c). This finding is consistent with the explanation that label bias is due to LLMs favoring more common tokens (e.g., B over C), as this bias is reduced when using labels that are uncommon for the task at hand. LLMs’ favoring of common tokens mirrors psychological work that finds that exposure frequency positively affects people’s liking [39].

All figures show 95% confidence intervals (CIs) estimated using a random effects linear model (lmer in R), which included random intercept for triplet.

Because we systematically and jointly manipulate multiple elements of prompt architecture, we can also examine how these architectural elements interact to produce bias. First, we examine how response-order and label bias interact with each other. We find that the former is much stronger when using symbols (which are uncommon labels) than when using letters (which are common labels). GPT-4 selected the first option in 53.55% of the cases that were labeled with letters and 73.35% of the cases that were labeled with symbols. This is consistent with contemporaneous work with GPT that finds that order bias is more pronounced when options are labeled using less common letters, such as N, R, S, rather than more common letters, such as A, B, C [28]. That is, when the labels of the various options are weaker cues, GPT-4 seems to rely more heavily on other cues (i.e., the ordering of the options), suggesting that simply removing the bias from one element (e.g., labeling) will not necessarily improve LLM performance given the multifaceted nature of prompt architecture; potential bias lurks in every semantic corner of a prompt, and reducing one form of bias may simply open the opportunity for another bias to dominate.

Second, we examine the two additional architectural elements of (i) framing and (ii) justification and test whether they impact response-order or lettered-label bias. We find that asking GPT-4 for justification reduces but does not eliminate response-order bias (from the first option being selected in 67.87% of cases to 58.28% of cases) and lettered-label bias (from “B” being selected in 78.76% of cases to 69.50% of cases). This is consistent with prior work in choice architecture that finds that when people feel accountable for their decisions, they are less likely to rely on contextual cues in their decision making [35]. However, research also finds that justification can bias human decision makers in other ways. For example, asking for justification leads people to select options that contain features that are easier to articulate, even if these options are less preferred (e.g., a humorous poster vs. an abstract, aesthetic one) [34]. Although LLMs do not experience emotions or motivation, structural patterns in the training set could lead to similar results. For example, perhaps asking an LLM to justify its selection of a job candidate or image could bias it toward decisions that are easier to articulate, such as the candidate with a higher GPA or an image with more discernible components. Again, as choice architecture dictates, there is no neutral prompt. Asking for justification might bypass one type of bias but unwittingly invite another.

We also find that framing interacts with both response-order and label bias. Specifically, we find that both response-order and letter-label biases are stronger when GPT-4 is asked which set is closer to a given stimulus than when it is asked which set is farther from it (from the first option being selected in 70.36% of cases with closer framing to 56.37% of cases with farther framing, and from option “B” being selected in 79.68% of cases with closer framing to 68.60% of cases with farther framing;ps <.001). Response-order and label bias are probably multiply determined, and a “closer” framing may exacerbate bias in our similarity paradigm for several reasons. One possibility could be that order and label are part of the stimuli evaluated by GPT (e.g., the content of the set is “bundled” with its letter and position, and the bundle is evaluated holistically). If this is the case, the answer could be influenced by the fact that A is closer to B than C and the first response is physically closer to the reference stimuli than the second response. Another possibility is that the “closer” framing is a more common question. The effect could then be interpreted in the context of work in psychology showing that people are more likely to rely on heuristic processing when stimuli are familiar and/or easy to process [40]. Future research could test whether a less familiar framing leads LLMs to process in a way that appears more thorough, similarly to a request for justification.

Although we do not have answers as towhyan individual element of prompt architecture affects GPT evaluations, we provide robust evidence for the widespread and intricate effect of prompt architecture. Our results show that subtle differences in the context of choices that affect human decision making are also affecting GPT-4 evaluations. Not only did all four classic elements of choice architecture that we manipulated impact GPT-4 evaluations, but these elements interacted with each other to form a complex web of different biases. In our particular setup, the prompt that yielded the most bias was when sets were labeled A, B, C and GPT-4 was asked which set was closer (the likely default framing for many users). In this case, GPT-4 selected B (which also happens to be the first response) in a remarkable 91.67% of the cases.

We replicate these results using Llama 3.1 (S3 File) and GPT-3 (S4 File). Similar to GPT-4, Llama 3.1 exhibits response-order bias (Llama 3.1 selected the first response in 58.14% of cases) and label bias (Llama 3.1 selected B for 76.70% of the cases and % for 76.73% of the cases), and these biases are moderated by label type, framing, and justification, though not always in the same way as in GPT-4. For example, the prompt that yields the most bias is when sets are labeled #, %, * and Llama 3.1 is asked which set is closer. In this setup, Llama 3.1 selected % (which also happens to be the first response) in a remarkable 99.44% of the cases. GPT-3 also exhibits response-order bias and label bias. However, relative to GPT-4, the response-order bias was reduced (GPT-3 selected the first response in 53.16% of cases) and the label bias increased (GPT-3 selected B for 64.10% of the cases and % for 77.15% of the cases). As with GPT-4, these biases are moderated by label type, framing, and justification, though again, not always in the same way. For example, first response bias was exacerbated when GPT-3 was asked for justification (whereas it was reduced with GPT-4). These findings imply that identifying the “least biased” prompt or avoiding the “most biased” prompt may be futile, as different LLMs and different versions may react to prompt architecture differently. We examine the implications of these results further in the General Discussion.

Study 2 had two goals: to investigate the effect of response-order and label bias using one single-word item per set, in which evaluations are arguably much easier, and to test an intervention identified by contemporaneous research to reduce bias. Specifically, Gui and Toubia [41] find that manipulating prompt content can confound experiments due to associations in LLM training data. For example, manipulating the price in a prompt affects the kind of consumer information the LLM draws from when responding. Importantly, this work finds that specifying to the LLM that the price is randomly determined may help mitigate this confound. If the biases we observe here are due to confounding factors that correlate with the choice of order and label (e.g., more important or prominent items listed first in the training set), perhaps instructing LLM that order and label were determined randomly would similarly reduce the effect. If, however, prompt architecture effects are driven by intrinsic or idiosyncratic tendencies in favor of certain prompt characteristics, we may not observe an attenuation. We test these competing predictions in Study 2.

We again use the API of GPT-4 pinned on 06/13/203 and a temperature of 0. We employ a similar experimental design to that in our main experiment, with two modifications. First, we use sets with single items that are all single words (unigrams). Second, from the design in Study 1, we include the four conditions that orthogonally vary the order of the items and the order of the labels (A-B-C vs. A-C-B), but we only use letters as labels, only ask GPT-4 which item was closer to item A, and never ask for justification. This replicates the conditions that produced the highest level of bias in Study 1.

A crucial difference in this study is the introduction of our intervention factor in the experimental design. In the first condition (Control), we simply ask GPT-4 which of the two items is closer. In the second condition (Randomized), we add the following statement at the end of the prompt: “I have randomized the order and labels of these two items.” In the third condition (Chosen), we add: “I have chosen the order and labels of these two items.” If the order and label biases are due to confounding factors that correlate with the choice of order and labels, the bias may be attenuated in the Randomized condition and potentially exacerbated in the Chosen condition compared with the Control condition.

Combining these experimental factors in a 2 (item ordering) × 2 (label ordering) × 3 (Control vs. Randomized vs. Chosen) full factorial design, we have 12 prompts per triplet. We use the same six categories as in Study 1 but this time increase the number of replications to 900 per category. Therefore, our experimental design generates 64,800 observations. All data and code used to analyze the data are available at OSF (https://osf.io/2pzh9/?view_only=aa6d1b2759134b7a8408d7ccc38f1922).

Of the 64,800 observations, GPT-4 failed to complete the task 489 times (.75% failure rate). We removed these observations to obtain our final dataset of 64,311 observations.

On average, across all observations, we replicate both response-order and label bias among these simpler, single-word items. GPT-4 selected the first option in 64.29% of the cases (p<.001) and selected response “B” in 66.72% of the cases (p<.001).

AsFig 3ashows, order bias is consistent across the Control, Chosen, and Randomized conditions, varying only between 63.82% in the Randomized condition to 65.00% in the Chosen condition. We again find evidence of bias in favor of the label B over C, which is again consistent across conditions, as shown inFig 3b. The frequency of the B selection varies only between 65.95% in the Randomized condition and 67.30% in the Control condition.



A.Frequency of first response selection for GPT-4 across conditions.B.Frequency of selecting the set labeled as B for GPT-4 among observations in which sets are labeled using letters. Both figures show 95% CIs estimated using a random effects linear model (lmer in R), which included random intercept for triplet.

In summary, although in the context of using LLMs to simulate human response to price variations research finds that confounding may be reduced by informing the LLM of the source of random variation across stimuli [41], in our context, in which we ask LLMs to evaluate similarity, informing the LLM that the ordering and labeling of items have been randomized has only negligible effects and does not appear as a viable solution to the problem. Our results instead are more consistent with those of Zheng et al. [29], who find that a similar intervention does not mitigate label bias in the context of multiple-choice questions with objectively correct answers.

As in Study 1, we replicate this study design using Llama 3.1 (S5 File) and again find no evidence that the intervention worked. Instead, indicating that the order and labels were “chosen” or “randomized” flipped and exacerbated the response-order effect (among those prompts, Llama 3.1 was significantly more likely to select theseconditem). This further underscores that although the presence of prompt architecture effects is predictable, the specific impacts are unpredictable.

The arbitrary architecture of a prompt induces statistical bias in the responses of LLMs, with the responses partly due to “the particular research technique employed, rather than an accurate representation of the world” [18]. These insidious methodological artifacts threaten the validity of any evaluation or output that stems from a single prompt provided to an LLM. For example, GPT may find that the set arbitrarily labeled as “Set B” is closer to “Set A” in as many as 80% or more of cases simply because of the architecture of the prompt. Moreover, in practice, order and labels may not be applied randomly. For example, users may list their personal favorite option first. Thus, the results we report suggest that LLMs may inadvertently serve as a confirmation bias tool rather than an unbiased adviser.

Our main goal is to present an overarching framework to understand the scope of hidden methodological biases rather than delineate the process behind any particular bias. Borrowing from extensive work in choice architecture [19], our framework suggests that there will never be such a thing as a “neutral” or “perfect” prompt. Indeed, knowing all the hidden biases embedded in rich language data is impossible; thus, specific solutions or prompt types that address bias in a certain task might not generalize to other tasks. Rather than trying to remove bias through “perfect prompts,” we advise researchers and practitioners to apply the principles that human subject experiments have employed for decades—aggregating the output of multiple prompts that vary according to a full counterbalanced design, in an attempt to cancel out idiosyncratic errors of any single prompt [36].

As an initial test of this strategy for reducing bias, we examine how aggregating the output of our 32 prompts in Study 1 reduces bias in responses provided by both GPT-4 and Llama 3.1. Specifically, given our experimental design, in which we create Set 1, Set 2, and Set 3 by randomly drawing from a list of items in a category, the chance that Set 2 (vs. Set 3) is selected in a prompt asking about which is farther from or closer to Set 1 should be close to 50%. In other words, there should be nothing intrinsically different about Set 2 versus Set 3 in our 30 triplets randomly generated across six categories; thus, an unbiased responder should not show systematic preference for Set 2 over Set 3.

We find that the extent of bias varies across prompts, with the most biased prompts selecting the arbitrary Set 2 100% of the time across all triplets and categories (Fig 4). The specific prompts that demonstrate the least bias (e.g., approach 50% selection of Set 2) are different across the two models, suggesting that there is no ideal “unbiased” prompt. Instead, we suggest aggregating across different prompt types, that is, simply using the majority answer across prompt variations: for a particular triplet, across the 32 prompt formats we count the number of times the model indicated that Set 2 was closer and the number of times it indicated that Set 3 was closer, and we use the majority answer as the final answer. We find that this simple approach eliminates bias: Set 2 is selected 50% of the time when aggregating across all 32 prompts for both GPT-4 (50.01%) and Llama 3.1 (50.06%).



Both figures show 95% CIs estimated using a random effects linear model (lmer in R), which included random intercept for triplet.

Note that eliminating bias does not necessarily improve accuracy. For example, a coin flip would produce an unbiased but inaccurate answer. To ensure that our intervention did not compromise accuracy, we ran an experiment identical to Study 1 but with single-word items and used Word2Vec word embeddings to calculate a noisy proxy for similarity and, in turn, GPT-4’s accuracy when making similarity judgments. Our results suggest that aggregating reduces bias while increasing accuracy (S6 File). Thus, the benefit of aggregation is that it reduces bias while improving accuracy. The drawback is that it requires identifying the elements of prompt architecture that might bias an LLM’s response and creating a full factorial set of prompts to address this bias, and doing so could be time and resource intensive. In cases in which this is too daunting, we recommend, at minimum, balancing order and labeling.

One concern might be whether the effects of prompt architecture are simply a snapshot in time, destined to be fixed by newer models. As an initial exploration of this possibility, we turn to our study 1 replication experiment with GPT-3. Although we observe differences between GPT-3 and GPT-4, the changes are not necessarily for the better (S4 File). Although we find significant bias in favor of the first option (p<.001), the bias appears to be less severe in GPT-3 than GPT-4, suggesting that, at least in terms of this particular type of bias, GPT is not improving. This is not particularly surprising given the nature of LLMs, which are trained on rich and complex natural language data. Identifying and removing any cues in a prompt’s architecture seem unlikely, if not impossible, given the nature of language. In summary, the power of LLMs is undeniable, but these models should be used with discerning judgment and a thoughtful experimental design.

Our empirical context involved both simple and complex similarity tasks and formally worded prompts, which represents only a subset of the diverse types of prompts users might provide to LLMs. This raises the question of how our findings generalize to other contexts, such as tasks that vary in complexity beyond the similarity tasks in our studies or prompts that are phrased less formally than our prompts. Prior research with human participants provides a few hypotheses. First, human respondents are more likely to be influenced by choice architecture during complex tasks because these tasks involve more in-the-moment response construction [23,42]. Thus, our observed effects of prompt architecture may exacerbate for more complex tasks and attenuate for simpler tasks compared to the similarity task used in our studies. However, of note, we observed effects of prompt architecture for both simple (i.e., one-item stimuli) and complex (i.e., five-item stimuli) similarity tasks. Second, research suggests that informality during communication, such as text abbreviations, can signal low effort and, as a result, decrease responsiveness [43]. If this pattern exists in the training data, LLMs may be less responsive (e.g., provide less thorough justification) when the prompt contains more informal language usage. We encourage future research to explore the generalizability of our findings, including how complexity moderates the effects of prompt architecture and how additional architectural elements beyond the ones examined in this paper, such as prompt formality, may influence LLM responses.

The following screenshot was taken on 03/08/2024. We use the API Playground to mimic the conditions of our experiment: GPT-4 pinned on 06/13/23, with a temperature of 0. The “System” portion of the prompt was set to its default (“You are a helpful assistant”).

Reviewer #1: The study probes into prompt architecture—biases responses provided by Large Language Models (LLMs). Mimicking findings in choice architecture, the study finds robust evidence that label, order, framing, and asking for reasons affects LLM responses. Two major findings was, (i) the use of uncommon labels reduces (but does not eliminate) label bias but exacerbates response order bias and (ii) specifying to the LLM that the labels and order of the items have been randomized does not alleviate either response order or label bias.

Major Comments

I enjoyed reading this manuscript and believe it holds great promise. However, I have identified minor issues that require the authors' attention:

Various detailed studies in the field of Medicine have utilized multiple-choice questions, particularly in the format of A, B, and C. These studies often use complex clinical cases from sources such as the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) Clinicopathological Conference (CPC). With detailed reasoning, large language models (LLMs) predict the answers. These predictions, when justified, are correct answers and not biases. Any comments?

The sentence 'Although we find that asking for justification reduces response order and label bias, it is possible that it could exacerbate other biases we did not measure'. These other potential biases can be discussed further.

The sentence 'However, the bias appears to be less severe in GPT-3 compared to GPT-4, with 53.2% vs. 63.21% of the cases, respectively'. This important finding should be mentioned in the main manuscript, not only in the supplemental data.

Due to the proprietary nature of GPT models, there is growing interest in open-source LLMs. Is it possible to test the hypothesis with other open-source models like LLaMA-3?

Check the reference:

Artefacts, statistical and methodological. In: Oxford Reference.

Reviewer #2: The paper presents a highly engaging and insightful study on the biases present in GPT label generation. However, to enhance the quality and comprehensiveness of the work, I suggest the following revisions:

Firstly, the task itself needs to be more clearly defined. The authors should specify the exact types of labels they expect to encounter and analyze. This clarity will provide a better framework for understanding the scope and objectives of their study.

Secondly, the language throughout the paper requires some refinement. At certain points, the writing becomes too informal, which detracts from the scholarly tone of the work. A more formal and consistent style would improve the overall readability and professionalism of the paper.

Additionally, the authors focus exclusively on GPT-4. This focus raises concerns about potential bias towards proprietary models. It would be beneficial to include a comparison with open-source large language models (LLMs) such as LLaMA or Mistral to provide a more balanced analysis.

The definition of bias within the context of the study is another critical area that needs attention. The authors should refer to relevant definitions and frameworks, such as those discussed in the paper available at [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10538997), to establish a definition and solid theoretical foundation for their analysis. the literature review needs to be updated to reflect the latest research and developments in the field. This update will ensure that the study is situated within the current academic discourse and acknowledges recent advancements and discussions.

Clarification is also needed on whether the labeling process employed in the study is stochastic. Understanding the nature of the labeling process is essential for assessing the reliability and consistency of the generated labels.

The authors should provide a thorough discussion of the pros and cons of their approach. This analysis will help readers understand the strengths and limitations of the method and its potential implications for future research and applications.

From what I understand, the authors aim to mitigate the biases in GPT-generated labels by proposing a more reliable approach. To enhance the practical value of their study, they should include an algorithm presented in pseudocode. This inclusion would provide a clear, actionable method for other researchers and practitioners to implement and build upon their work.

Thank you for pointing out a very important context where our findings may or may not generalize. Indeed, there are papers that find that LLMs can be quite accurate for multiple-choice questions in medicine (Harsha et al., 2023; McDuff et al., 2023; Singhal et al., 2023). However, early evidence suggests that LLM responses might also be affected by prompt architecture in the medical context. For example, Hager et al. (2024) find that the order of options in multiple-choice questions affects LLM’s answers in clinical decision making, and Arroyo et al. (2024) find that the performance of LLMs on tasks such as mortality prediction vary based on slight differences in the wording of the instructions. Therefore, we believe our findings are also relevant to the medical domain, which we now cite thanks to your input.

2. “The sentence 'Although we find that asking for justification reduces response order and label bias, it is possible that it could exacerbate other biases we did not measure'. These other potential biases can be discussed further.”

Thank you for your suggestion to further elaborate on this interesting possibility. We include a discussion of the possible biases induced by asking for justification on page 12, lines 199-204 (following “However, research also finds that asking for reasons can bias human decision makers in other ways”).

“For example, asking for justification leads people to select options that contain features that are easier to articulate, even if these options are less preferred (e.g., a humorous poster vs. an abstract, aesthetic one) (37). Perhaps asking an LLM to justify its selection of a job candidate or image could bias it toward decisions that are easier to articulate, such as the candidate with a higher GPA or an image with more discernible components.”

3. “The sentence 'However, the bias appears to be less severe in GPT-3 compared to GPT-4, with 53.2% vs. 63.21% of the cases, respectively'. This important finding should be mentioned in the main manuscript, not only in the supplemental data.”

We now mention this finding in the main manuscript on page 21, lines 370-373. We further reference the finding in the abstract.

4. “Due to the proprietary nature of GPT models, there is growing interest in open-source LLMs. Is it possible to test the hypothesis with other open-source models like LLaMA-3?”

Thank you for encouraging us to replicate our effect using an open-source LLM. Following your suggestion and R2’s, we replicated both studies using Llama 3.1. We mention these replication in the abstract and on page 13, lines 232-237 and page 16, lines 301-306 of the manuscript, and report the replications in Supplements D and F. Overall, the results support our proposition that prompt architecture induces methodological bias: we document both response-order and label effects using Llama 3.1, although GPT-4 and Llama 3.1 sometimes differ in the exact the nature of these biases (e.g., Llama 3.1 exhibits stronger symbol label bias than GPT-4). This suggests that although the presence of prompt architecture effects is robust to different models and versions, the specific impact of different features of prompt architecture is subject to change.

“We replicate these results using Llama 3.1 (see Supplemental Information D). Similar to GPT-4, Llama 3.1 exhibits response-order bias and label bias, and these biases are moderated by label type, framing, and justification, though not always in the same way as in GPT-4. Here, the prompt that yields the most bias is when sets are labeled #, %, * and Llama 3.1 is asked which set is closer. In this setup, Llama 3.1 selected % (which also happens to be the first response) in a remarkable 99.44% of the cases..”

“As in Study 1, we replicate this study design using Llama 3.1 (see Supplemental Information F) and again find no evidence that the intervention worked. Instead, indicating that the order and labels were chosen or randomized flipped and exacerbated the response-order effect (among those prompts, Llama 3.1 was significantly more likely to select the second item). This further underscores that although the presence of prompt architecture effects is predictable, the specific impacts are unpredictable.”

5. Lastly, thank you for directing our attention to an incorrect reference. We have fixed this reference. Note, it is a dictionary webpage from Oxford Reference:

Reviewer 2:

We appreciate your thoughtful comments and helpful feedback. We have implemented your suggestions and believe that the paper is much stronger as a result. Below we quote your concerns and then summarize the steps we took to address each one.

1. “Firstly, the task itself needs to be more clearly defined. The authors should specify the exact types of labels they expect to encounter and analyze. This clarity will provide a better framework for understanding the scope and objectives of their study.”

Thank you for the opportunity to clarify the scope and objectives of our study. First, to clarify, labels in our context are not related to the topic of data labeling in machine learning. Instead, we are interested in the order (e.g., whether an option is presented in the first, second or third position) and labels (e.g., whether an option is labeled as “A” or “B” or “C”) assigned to the various response options in multiple choice evaluation tasks. In our context, labels are selected by the user engaging with the LLM and they should theoretically have no effect on the answer provided by the LLM because they are not a reflection of the data. We have clarified this context in the example we provide in the introduction as well as the use cases on Page 4 lines 59-65.

“For example, managers (researchers) interested in replacing their workforce (human subjects) with generative AI may ask GPT to evaluate the similarity between different sets of items. They also need to decide how to label each set in the prompts they submit to GPT, the order in which to list the sets, and how to word the exact task. For example, a user may decide to write the prompt: “Is Set B or Set C closer to Set A?” Evaluative tasks such as these, with multiple choices that are ordered and labeled, span many different LLM use cases, including diagnoses (9,11), opinion polls and surveys (2,3), and social science experiments (5,7,8).”

We also include examples of other labels that LLMs might encounter on pages 4-5, lines 75-77:

“In other words, without taking this form of bias into account, a user may erroneously conclude that set A is closer to set B, candidate 1 is more qualified than candidate 2, or diagnosis I is more likely than diagnosis II, simply because of the architecture of the prompt.”

2. “Secondly, the language throughout the paper requires some refinement. At certain points, the writing becomes too informal, which detracts from the scholarly tone of the work. A more formal and consistent style would improve the overall readability and professionalism of the paper.”

Thank you for pointing out that, at times, our writing came across as too informal. We have updated our writing throughout the paper in order to better reflect a scholarly tone. For example:

• We replaced the colloquial word “mimicking” with a more accepted term “mirroring”

• We reworded “Is it possible that a less familiar framing leads GPT to process in a way that appears more thorough, just as the request for justification?” to “Future research may test whether a less familiar framing leads LLMs to process in a way that appears more thorough, similarly to a request for justification.”

• We removed the reference suggesting that GPT might get “lazier” during holidays, as this was not from an academic source.

We also hired a professional copyeditor to further improve the paper’s writing.

3. “Additionally, the authors focus exclusively on GPT-4. This focus raises concerns about potential bias towards proprietary models. It would be beneficial to include a comparison with open-source large language models (LLMs) such as LLaMA or Mistral to provide a more balanced analysis.”

Thank you for encouraging us to replicate our effect using an open-source LLM. Following your suggestion and R1’s, we replicated both studies using Llama 3.1. We mention these replication in the abstract and on page 13, lines 232-237 and page 16, lines 301-306 of the manuscript, and, and report the replications in Supplements D and F. Overall, the results support our proposition that prompt architecture induces methodological bias: we document both response order and label effects using Llama 3.1, although GPT-4 and Llama 3.1 sometimes differ in the exact the nature of these biases (e.g., Llama 3.1 exhibits stronger symbol label bias than GPT-4). This suggests that although the presence of prompt architecture effects is robust to different models and versions, the specific impact of different features of prompt architecture is subject to change.

“We replicate these results using Llama 3.1 (see Supplemental Information D). Similar to GPT-4, Llama 3.1 exhibits response-order bias and label bias, and these biases are moderated by label type, framing, and justification, though not always in the same way as in GPT-4. Here, the prompt that yields the most bias is when sets are labeled #, %, * and Llama 3.1 is asked which set is closer. In this setup, Llama 3.1 selected % (which also happens to be the first response) in a remarkable 99.44% of the cases.”

“As in Study 1, we replicate this study design using Llama 3.1 (see Supplemental Information F) and again find no evidence that the intervention worked. Instead, indicating that the order and labels were chosen or randomized flipped and exacerbated the response-order effect (among those prompts, Llama 3.1 was significantly more likely to select the second item). This further underscores that although the presence of prompt architecture effects is predictable, the specific impacts are unpredictable.”

4. “The definition of bias within the context of the study is another critical area that needs attention. The authors should refer to relevant definitions and frameworks, such as those discussed in the paper available at [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10538997), to establish a definition and solid theoretical foundation for their analysis. “

Thank you for encouraging us to define bias in the context of our study and for the excellent reference. We now contrast how bias has been defined and explored in prior literature with our definition to (a) better couch our findings in the extant literature and (b) clarify our contribution. In our context, bias is defined as a form of statistical bias, specifically methodological artifacts. Our work on statistical bias complements the very important extant work in LLMs on social bias, which studies “the predisposition or inclination toward a particular group (based on gender or race)... that can unduly influence the representation or treatment of particular groups.” (Raza et al., 2024) These edits are reflected in the text on pages 3-4, lines 47-55:

“In this article, we complement work that defines bias as “the predisposition or inclination toward a particular group (based on gender or race), often rooted in social stereotypes, that can unduly influence the representation or treatment of particular groups” (16) by focusing on methodological artifacts, or biases due to the specificities of a given task design. Methodological artifacts are a form of statistical bias, as they are systematic errors that lead to conclusions that are partly “a result of the particular research technique employed, rather than an accurate representation of the world” (18). Using a choice architecture framework, we examine how arbitrary associations embedded in the rich language data used to train LLMs may induce statistical bias (and, therefore, errors) in output.”

Defining our bias as a form of statistical bias provides a foundation for our design and analysis, as we delineate on page 7, lines 134-138:

“This is a full factorial design in which each set has one instance of each order and label combination, which allows us to test for statistical bias because we experimentally manipulate order and label independent of the actual content of the set. As a result, any impact of order and/or label is definitionally biased and does not reflect a real difference between sets.”

We believe the updated manuscript provides a fuller picture of how statistical bias can manifest in LLM output, clarifies our contribution, and grounds our work by providing a theoretical foundation for analysis.

5. “The literature review needs to be updated to reflect the latest research and developments in the field. This update will ensure that the study is situated within the current academic discourse and acknowledges recent advancements and discussions.”

Thank you for ensuring our literature review of this fast-moving field is up to date. We have updated the status of our references, surveyed recent additions to the academic discourse and identified new papers to include in our review.

In particular, we added the following references that have studies LLM biases of a social nature:

We therefore generated a plasmid-based cDNA reverse genetics system for LACV utilizing a more stable and high-copy number plasmid backbone. Additionally, we created the first full reverse genetics systems for two closely related orthobunyaviruses, Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV), and Inkoo virus (INKV), which have differing reported disease incidences in humans and differing neuropathogenic phenotypes in mice compared to LACV. We compared wild type (wt) viruses with RGS-derived wt viruses in human neuronal cells and in mice, and found that RGS-derived wt viruses maintained the replication and neuropathogenic phenotypes of their wt counterpart. Additionally, we demonstrated that reverse genetics plasmids from different parental viruses can be readily mixed-and-matched to generate reassortant viruses.

The encephalitic orthobunyaviruses have tri-segmented, negative sense RNA genomes and can cause severe neurological disease in humans, including La Crosse virus (LACV), which is the leading cause of pediatric arboviral encephalitis in the United States. However, little is known about the genetic factors that drive neuropathogenesis. Reverse genetics systems (RGS) are valuable tools for studying viral genetics and pathogenesis. Plasmid-based cDNA reverse genetics systems are available for LACV, however the plasmid backbones are medium-copy number and have a propensity for recombination. We therefore generated a plasmid-based cDNA reverse genetics system for LACV utilizing a more stable and high-copy number plasmid backbone. Additionally, we created the first full reverse genetics systems for two closely related orthobunyaviruses, Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV), and Inkoo virus (INKV), which have differing reported disease incidences in humans and differing neuropathogenic phenotypes in mice compared to LACV. We compared wild type (wt) viruses with RGS-derived wt viruses in human neuronal cells and in mice, and found that RGS-derived wt viruses maintained the replication and neuropathogenic phenotypes of their wt counterpart. Additionally, we demonstrated that reverse genetics plasmids from different parental viruses can be readily mixed-and-matched to generate reassortant viruses. This system provides a valuable genetic tool utilizing viruses with differing neuropathogenic phenotypes to investigate the genetic determinants of orthobunyavirus neuropathogenesis.

The GenusOrthobunyaviruscontains many members capable of causing severe neurological disease in humans. These include closely related La Crosse virus (LACV), Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV), and Inkoo virus (INKV) in the California Serogroup (CSG; [1]). LACV is the leading cause of pediatric arboviral encephalitis in the USA and causes ~100 neuroinvasive cases per year. The mortality rate of LACV is ~1% and long-term sequelae including seizure disorders and cognitive defects are common in survivors. JCV is found in the USA and Canada and causes ~50 neuroinvasive cases per year, primarily in adults. INKV is primarily found in Scandinavia and has been reported to cause a handful of neuroinvasive cases [2]. Our previous studies on the neuropathogenesis of these viruses identified key differences in their ability to gain access to the brain from the periphery (neuroinvasion) and their ability to replicate and cause damage and disease in the brain (neurovirulence) [3,4]. We found that LACV was neuroinvasive with high neurovirulence, JCV was not neuroinvasive but with high neurovirulence, and interestingly, INKV was neuroinvasive but with low neurovirulence. The viral determinants that mediate neuropathogenesis are not well understood.

Orthobunyaviruses have three negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome segments: L, M, and S. The L segment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L protein) [5]. The M segment encodes a polyprotein with the two envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) and a nonstructural protein (NSm) of uncertain function [6,7]. The S segment encodes the nucleocapsid protein (N) which forms protective ribonucleoprotein complexes with the RNA genome, and nonstructural protein S (NSs), which is encoded within the N reading frame and results from leaky ribosomal scanning [7,8]. NSs is an interferon (IFN) antagonist [9] and the only known virulence factor for LACV.

Previous studies of orthobunyavirus genetic determinants of neuropathogenesis have largely relied on generating reassortant viruses using highly passaged attenuated viruses with unknown mutations [10,11]. More recent studies have utilized LACV reverse genetics systems to investigate the effect of targeted mutations, gene deletions, or ORF replacements in LACV neuropathogenesis [12–14]. While this approach provides critical insights into viral genetics, a limitation of this strategy to investigate viral determinants of neuropathogenesis is that mutations may disrupt protein functions in multiple ways. Viral proteins often serve multiple roles during infection, which can confound results and make teasing out mechanism from viral gene mutations and knockouts difficult.

To develop a reverse genetics system (RGS) that keeps viral proteins unchanged, we leveraged the key differences in neuropathogenic phenotypes between LACV, JCV, and INKV, to create full cDNA plasmid-based reverse genetics systems for each virus. We showed that RGS-derived wild type viruses maintained their replication and neuropathogenic phenotypes in human neuronal cells and mice compared to their wt counterpart. We also showed we can generate replication competent-derived reassortant viruses by mixing-and-matching L, M, and S RGS plasmids between the different viruses. With this system we generated a higher fidelity LACV reverse genetics system, as well as the first reported reverse genetics systems for JCV and INKV. This system provides a valuable genetic tool utilizing wild type versions of viral genes from viruses with disparate neuropathogenic phenotypes to investigate the viral determinants of orthobunyavirus neuropathogenesis.

Gibco reagents were used unless otherwise specified. The BSR-T7/5 cells, a BHK cell line derivative that stably expresses T7 polymerase generated by Buchholz et al. [15], were maintained in GMEM supplemented 2mM L-Glutamine solution, 1x MEM Amino Acid Solution, and 10% FBS (Atlas Biologicals EF-0500-A), and every other passage with 1mg/ml Geneticin. Vero cells (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1x penicillin-streptomycin. SH-SY5Y cells (ATCC) were maintained in 1:1 ratio of EMEM (ATCC) and F-12K (ATCC) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1x pen-strep. LACV (human 1978), JCV (61V2235), and INKV (SW AR 83–161) were gifted by Dr. Karin Peterson (NIAID). Intermediate stocks of wild type (wt), RGS_wt, and RGS-derived reassortant viruses were generated in Vero cells with media supplemented with 25µg/ml of Plasmocin (Invivogen NC9886956) and harvested at 80% CPE at 2–4 dpi, then final stock viruses made in normal media.

Plasmids were constructed using our wt virus stocks and sequences of LACV human 1978, JCV 61V2235, and INKV SW-AR-83–161 [16]. All plasmids were generated in the pMK vector backbone. Full reverse genetics systems plasmids encoded full cDNA copies of the L, M, and S antigenome segments. Plasmids containing the full coding regions and UTRs of JCV and INKV M and S segments flanked by a T7 promoter and hepatitis delta virus ribozyme as previously described [12,13] were synthesized by Invitrogen GeneArt in the pMK vector backbone to generate reverse genetics plasmids pJCV-M, pJCV-S, pINKV-M, and pINKV-S. pMK plasmid vectors encoding the LACV L UTRs and portions of the INKV 3’ and 5’ coding regions or the JCV L UTRs and portions of the JCV 3’ and 5’ coding regions flanked by the T7 promoter and ribozyme were synthesized by GeneArt (pINKV-L_linker and pJCV-L_linker, respectively).

To make the LACV reverse genetics system plasmids, viral RNA from LACV-wt was isolated via Qiagen’s Viral RNA Mini Kit and cDNA generated using the iScript Select cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) and virus-specific primers (Eurofins; supplemental materials). Full-length cDNAs of LACV L, M, and S segments were made using Q5 High-Fidelity 2x Master Mix (New England Biolabs) using segment-specific primers with complementary 5’ overhangs with the vector backbone. The vector backbone was amplified using T7 promoter and ribozyme-specific primers. DNA assembly of the fragments was done using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (New England Biolabs) at 50°C for 15 min. Two µl of the assembly mix was transformed into homemade chemically competent Stbl3E. coli, which have a low rate of recombination due to mutations in the RecA gene, to generate pLACV-L, pLACV-M, and pLACV-S.

pINKV-L was generated using INKV-wt isolated RNA. cDNA was made using SuperScript IV VILO master mix (Invitrogen), and the coding region of INKV L amplified by PCR and purified using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-up System (Promega). The INKV L fragment and the pINKV-L_linker backbone were digested withAatII andBsrGI (New England Biolabs), purified, ligated with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) and transformed into homemade chemically competent Stbl3 cells. To generate pJCV-L, four fragments with 21–25 nucleotide overlaps encoding the JCV L segment were synthesized (GenScript). pJCV-L_linker was amplified using 2x Q5 high-fidelity master mix, digested withDpn I to remove the template DNA and gel purified. DNA assembly was carried out using the NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix for 60 min at 50°C. 2 µl assembly mix was transformed into 50 µl New England Biolabs 5-α chemically competentE. coliaccording to the manufacturer’s instructions. All plasmids were sequenced-verified by Plasmidsaurus and sequences analyzed with MacVector 18.5.1.

Transfections with the RGS plasmids were done by plating BSR-T7/5 cells at 1x105cells per well in a 6-well plate ~24 hours prior to transfection. Transfections were performed using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus MIR2304) according to manufacturer’s instructions with the following modifications: 0.5 µg of an L, M, and S plasmid and 9 µl TransIT-LT1 reagent was used per transfection mix. Supernatants were harvested and clarified at 48–72 hpt to recover RGS-derived wt viruses.

Replication kinetics assays were performed as previously described [3]. Briefly, SH-SY5Y cells were plated at 1x105cells per well in 96-well plates. The next day, cells were inoculated in triplicate at MOI=0.01, incubated 1 hour at 37°C, washed twice, and media replenished. Supernatants were harvested and clarified at 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hpi, then titered on Vero cells. Three independent experiments were performed.

Vero cells were plated in 24-well plates at ~1.3x105cells per well. The next day, virus was serially diluted 10-fold (replication kinetics) or 5-fold (virus stocks) and plated in duplicate in 200µl per well. Plates were incubated 1 hour at 37°C, then overlayed with 1.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (ThermoSci A18105.36) in MEM (Gibco 12360–038). Plates were fixed with 10% formaldehyde and stained with 0.35% crystal violet at 4 dpi.

All mouse experiments were approved by Montana State University’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee under protocol number 2023–238-IA and were performed in accordance with NIH guidelines. Neuroinvasive disease was evaluated by inoculating weanling mice (21–23 days of age) intraperitoneally with 1x105PFU virus. Neurovirulence was evaluated by inoculating adult mice (>6 weeks of age) intranasally with 1x104PFU virus. Humane endpoint criteria of neurological disease, impaired movement that inhibited access to food and water, and moribundity was used. Signs of neurological disease included ataxia, seizures, limb paralysis or weakness, tremors, and circling. Non-neurological “sick rodent” signs of disease such as hunched posture and ruffed fur were not used as endpoint criteria. Mice were monitored at least twice daily during the potential clinical phase of the experiments. As soon as mice were observed displaying humane endpoint criteria, they were immediately humanely euthanized via overdose of isoflurane and exsanguination. Due to the neurological nature of disease, some animals have spontaneous seizures that result in death. In our experiments using 143 mice, 11 mice were found dead without displaying prior signs of disease. Of these, seven were adults inoculated intranasally (one with JCV-wt, one with INKV-RGS_wt, two with LACV-wt, and three with LACV-RGS_wt), and four were weanlings inoculated intraperitoneally (one with INKV-wt, one with LACV-wt, and two with LACV-RGS_wt). Of the remaining mice, 65 mice displayed humane endpoint criteria, and 67 mice never displayed humane endpoint criteria and were humanely euthanized by 25 dpi. Mice were group housed to reduce stress. Due to the nature of these experiments to evaluate pathogenicity, no analgesics or anesthetics were used during the study period as these could affect the study outcome.

All statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism v. 10.2. Replication kinetics were evaluated by two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons test to determine differences between wt and RGS-derived wt viruses at any time point. Additional simple linear regression of slopes was performed for the log phase of viral growth at 6–72 hpi to compare 1) wt vs RGS-derived wt versions of the same virus and 2) all viruses compared to LACV-wt reference. Survival curves were analyzed via Mantel-Cox and Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon tests. For all analyses, p-values ≤0.05 were reported as significant.

We utilized a strategy that has been used for other LACV reverse genetics systems (RGS) with individual DNA plasmids encoding cDNA copies of each of the L, M, and S antigenome segments under the control of a T7 promoter with a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme at the 3’ end [12,13]. Previous LACV RGS have utilized the pBR322 vector backbone. However, this medium-copy number plasmid has a propensity for recombination which can frequently result in plasmids with full or partial duplications, making targeted genetic changes and sufficient plasmid recovery a challenge. We therefore used a more stable high-copy number plasmid, pMK, as the backbone vector for our RGS plasmids. The pMK vector is from the ThermoFisher GeneArt plasmid expression vector pMX. It is derived from the pUC19 vector, which is a well-established high-copy number plasmid containing the pBR322 vector with mutations in the replication primer and deletion of the rop gene, which increases its copy number from the original pBR322 vector [17]. The full viral segments from LACV, JCV, and INKV L, M, and S segments were generated using our wild-type (wt) stock viruses (virus-wt) reference sequences. We used a variety of cloning and DNA synthesis techniques to generate plasmids pLACV-L, pLACV-M, pLACV-S, pJCV-L, pJCV-M, pJCV-S, pINKV-L, pINKV-M, and pINKV-S. All plasmids encode the full coding sequence and UTRs from each individual viral segment, with the exception of pINKV-L. This plasmid contains the full L coding sequence from INKV with the LACV L segment UTRs, due to insufficient sequence information on the INKV L segment UTRs. Plasmids were sequenced and compared to wt reference sequences. pLACV-L had a single nonsynonymous mutation, pJCV-L had two nonsynonymous and one synonymous mutation, pINKV-L had two nonsynonymous mutations, and pINKV-M had two nonsynonymous and one synonymous mutation (Table 1).

To generate RGS-derived infectious wt virus, the L, M, and S plasmids for each virus were transfected in the BSR-T7/5 cells that constitutively express T7 polymerase [15]. Supernatants containing the RGS-derived wt virus (“virus-RGS_wt”) were collected from the transfected BSR-T7/5 cells, and this supernatant was titered on Vero cells. To compare viral titers between wt and RGS-derived wt viruses, Vero cells were inoculated with each virus at MOI=0.01. At ≥80% CPE, the Vero-inoculated supernatants were harvested and subsequently titered on Vero cells. Both the wt and RGS_wt versions of each virus grew to similar titers (Fig 1;S1 File), suggesting that RGS_wt viruses maintain the replication and infectivity phenotypes of their wt virus counterpart.



Vero cells were infected with wt viruses and RGS_wt viruses at MOI=0.01. Viruses harvested at ≥80% CPE, then titered on Vero cells.

To further evaluate whether RGS-derived wt viruses replicated similarly to their wt counterpart, we performed replication kinetics assays. We have previously used SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells to compare the replication kinetics of wt LACV, JCV, and INKV and found that JCV and INKV replicated slower than LACV [3]. We therefore evaluated the replication kinetics of our wt and RGS_wt viruses in SH-SY5Y cells. We inoculated cells with each virus at an MOI=0.01 and collected supernatants at 1–96 hpi. Supernatants were titered on Vero cells.

Overall, the replication kinetics of wt vs RGS_wt viruses of the same virus were similar. There were some minor time point titer differences, however none of these were significantly different via two-way ANOVA (Fig 2;Table 2;S1 File). All wt and RGS_wt viruses of the same virus reached similar peak titers on the same day (Fig 2,Table 2;S1 File). Linear regression analysis found no significant differences in viral replication between wt or RGS_wt viruses of the same virus (Table 2). However, similar to our previous comparisons of wt LACV, JCV, and INKV, there were differences between virus strains in replication kinetics (Table 2). Both JCV and INKV viruses had significantly slower replication kinetics compared to LACV, consistent with our previous studies [3]. Together, these results indicate that the RGS-derived wt viruses maintain their wt replication phenotypesin vitro.

We next evaluated if the RGS_wt viruses maintained their neuropathogenic phenotypes compared to their wt counterpart in mice. In our previous comparisons of LACV, JCV, and INKV of their ability to induce neuroinvasive disease after peripheral intraperitoneal (IP) inoculation in weanling mice. “Disease” refers to neurological signs or other endpoint criteria. We found that LACV caused disease in 100% of mice whereas JCV and INKV did not cause neuroinvasive disease in any mice [3]. We therefore inoculated weanling mice IP with 1x105PFU of the viruses to assess the development of neuroinvasive disease. Neurological signs included ataxia, paralysis, circling, and seizures. Both LACV-wt and LACV-RGS_wt induced neuroinvasive disease in 100% of mice at 4–6 dpi (Fig 3A). JCV-wt and JCV-RGS_wt did not cause neuroinvasive disease in any of the mice. INKV-RGS_wt did not cause neuroinvasive disease in any mice, however INKV-wt caused neuroinvasive disease in one out of twelve mice (Fig 3A). While we had not previously observed a mouse develop neuroinvasive disease from INKV, we have previously shown that INKV enters the brains of weanling mice in the absence of disease [3,4]. Therefore, it may not be surprising that occasionally an INKV-inoculated mouse may develop neuroinvasive disease. Despite this, there was no significant difference between any wt and RGS_wt virus of the same strain via simple survival curve analysis.



A) Weanling mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 1x105PFU virus. B) Adult mice were inoculated intranasally with 1x104PFU virus. Mice were followed for neurological signs of disease. n=11-12.

To evaluate neurovirulence phenotypes, we inoculated adult mice intranasally with 1x104PFU and followed them for neurological signs. At this route and dose, we have previously shown that LACV and JCV induced disease in 100% of mice, whereas INKV induced disease in ~15–20% of mice [3]. Consistent with previous results, LACV-wt caused neurological disease in 100% of mice at 6–9 dpi, and LACV-RGS_wt caused disease in 100% of mice at 7–9 dpi (Fig 3B). JCV-wt caused disease in 100% of mice at 6–7 dpi and JCV-RGS_wt caused neurological disease in 100% of mice at 6–8 dpi (Fig 3B). INKV-wt and INKV-RGS_wt induced neurological disease in one and two mice out of twelve, respectively (Fig 3B). There was no significant difference between any wt and RGS_wt virus of the same strain via simple survival curve comparison analysis.

Together, these results demonstrate that RGS-derived wt viruses maintain the neuropathogenic phenotypes of their wt counterpart, making RG-derived viruses an accurate tool for comparing differences in orthobunyavirus neuropathogenesis.

As proof-of-principal that we can generate reassortant viruses using this reverse genetics system, we next performed mix-and-match transfections between LACV & INKV, LACV & JCV, and JCV & INKV to generate M segment reassortant viruses rLILV, rLJLV, rIJIV, and rJIJV, which are summarized inFig 4A. We titered the transfection supernatants, and then inoculated the RGS-derived reassortant viruses on Vero cells at MOI=0.01. The Vero cell supernatants were harvested at ≥80% CPE and subsequently titered on Vero cells in the same manner as previously described for the the wt and RGS_wt viruses (Fig 1). Consistent with the replication kinetics results, wt and RGS_wt viruses of the same strain had very similar titers (Fig 1). The RGS-derived reassortant viruses were more variable in titer than the parental viruses, but still reached titers of ~5x105– 2x107PFU/ml, depending on the virus (Figs 1,4B). These results demonstrate that infectious virus can be recovered by mixing and matching L, M, and S plasmids from different parental viruses.

B) Vero cells were infected at MOI=0.01 with wt, RGS_wt viruses, and RGS-derived reassortant viruses rLILV, rLJLV, rIJIV, and rJIJV.

Determining the underlying genetic factors that mediate orthobunyavirus neuropathogenesis is critical to understanding orthobunyavirus neurological disease and developing effective therapeutics and vaccines. To facilitate genetic comparisons between orthobunyaviruses with differing neuropathogenic phenotypes, we generated reverse genetics systems for LACV, JCV, and INKV. The three RGS-derived wt viruses maintained the neuropathogenic phenotypes of their wt counterparts bothin vitroandin vivo. Furthermore, plasmids can be readily mixed-and-matched between parental viruses to generate reassortant viruses, making these an ideal tool for genetic studies of orthobunyavirus molecular pathogenesis.

Healthy individuals possess a repeat 30-55 CGG units in length. Once the CGG repeat exceeds 200 copies it triggers methylation at the locus. This methylation covers the FMR1 promoter region and silences expression of the gene and the production of FMRP (fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein). The loss of FMRP is responsible for a number of pathologies including neurodevelopmental delay and autism spectrum disorder. Methylation of the expanded repeat in the FMR1 locus is the causal factor for FXS, however it is not known why the expanded repeat triggers this epigenetic change or how exactly DNA methylation is established. Intriguingly, genetic engineering of expanded CGG repeats of over 300 copies in the FMR1 locus in mice remains unmethylated. Also in humans, in very rare cases, individuals can have an FMR1 CGG expansion > 200 copies but the locus remains unmethylated. These unmethylated full mutation (UFM) individuals give us a rare opportunity to investigate the mechanism of FMR1 promoter methylation.<h4>Methods</h4>Fibroblasts were obtained from a healthy control, an FXS patient and two unmethylated full expansion carriers. RNA was extracted and comparative transcriptomic analysis was performed on all samples. Whole genome sequencing was carried out on DNA from the two UFM carriers and the results analysed to investigate DNA variants that could explain the observed differences in gene expression.<h4>Results</h4>Our analyses focused on genes involved in epigenetic modification. We show that Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 3 (TET3), a gene involved in DNA methylation, is significantly downregulated in UFM carriers compared to healthy controls or FXS patient derived cells.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the expansion of a CGG repeat in the 5’UTR of theFMR1(fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1) gene. Healthy individuals possess a repeat 30–55 CGG units in length. Once the CGG repeat exceeds 200 copies it triggers methylation at the locus. This methylation covers theFMR1promoter region and silences expression of the gene and the production of FMRP (fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein). The loss of FMRP is responsible for a number of pathologies including neurodevelopmental delay and autism spectrum disorder. Methylation of the expanded repeat in theFMR1locus is the causal factor for FXS, however it is not known why the expanded repeat triggers this epigenetic change or how exactly DNA methylation is established. Intriguingly, genetic engineering of expanded CGG repeats of over 300 copies in theFMR1locus in mice remains unmethylated. Also in humans, in very rare cases, individuals can have anFMR1CGG expansion > 200 copies but the locus remains unmethylated. These unmethylated full mutation (UFM) individuals give us a rare opportunity to investigate the mechanism ofFMR1promoter methylation.

Fibroblasts were obtained from a healthy control, an FXS patient and two unmethylated full expansion carriers. RNA was extracted and comparative transcriptomic analysis was performed on all samples. Whole genome sequencing was carried out on DNA from the two UFM carriers and the results analysed to investigate DNA variants that could explain the observed differences in gene expression.

Our analyses focused on genes involved in epigenetic modification. We show that Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 3 (TET3), a gene involved in DNA methylation, is significantly downregulated in UFM carriers compared to healthy controls or FXS patient derived cells. Genomic analyses reveal a number of rare variants present in theTET3locus in UFM carriers when compared to the reference genome. However, no clear modifying TET3 variants were identified.

Our results suggest thatTET3is a candidate factor responsible for the lack of methylation of the expandedFMR1locus. Further analyses are needed to further elucidate this relationship, however given its potential to directly interact with CGG repeats and its ambiguous role in 5-hydroxy-methylation of CG containing sequences,TET3is a strong candidate for further exploration.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the expansion of a CGG simple repeat in the 5’ untranslated region (5’UTR) of the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene. In the healthy population, repeat numbers range between 30 and 55 CGG repeat units. Individuals carrying 56–200 repeat units are said to carry a pre-mutation (PM) [1]. In some but not all cases of PM, the lengthened CGG repeat can cause degenerative disorders such as Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) or fragile X associated premature ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) [2–6]. In individuals affected by fragile X syndrome, repeat lengths exceed a threshold of 200 CGG repeat units [7]. Once the repeat exceeds 200 repeat units it gains DNA methylation which shuts down expression ofFMR1and leads to a global loss of fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein which plays an essential role in brain development [8]. Fragile X individuals who lack FMRP exhibit symptoms including neurodevelopmental delay and autism spectrum disorder. Interestingly, at very early stages of development, there is some evidence that theFMR1gene in FXS individuals is still active [9]. The locus is thought to gain methylation between 6 and 11 weeks of embryonic development [10]. Indeed, FXS embryonic stem cells (ESCs) carrying a full mutation which has not yet become methylated have been shown to gain methylation at the locus after 60 days of neuronal differentiation [11]. This shows that methylation at the expanded repeat is dynamic and suggests that another factor, in addition to the repeat expansion, is responsible for establishing DNA methylation at theFMR1locus.

Humanised FXS mice, which have an engineered CGG repeat expansion in theFMR1locus were created to study FXS and the methylation dynamics at the locus. Surprisingly, these mice do not gain methylation at theFMR1locus, even with repeat lengths up to 341 [12–15]. These mice display the pre-mutation associated symptoms but escape full methylation. This discrepancy with human FXS patients further supports the hypothesis that the repeat expansion by itself is insufficient to explain the silencing of theFMR1gene. This raises the possibility that mice lack a certain cellular factor required for establishing DNA methylation at theFMR1locus, or that mice more actively protect their CpG islands from methylation.

Further evidence for the presence of a cellular factor implicated in the methylation at theFMR1expanded repeat comes from a number of rare individuals who possess a full CGG expansion mutation (> 200 CGG repeats) but never gain methylation at the locus [16–18]. These unmethylated full mutation (UFM) individuals are very rare, with only a handful discovered globally. It would seem that these individuals lack the elusive factor responsible for establishing methylation at the expanded CGG repeat, without causing noticeable differences in the individual’s phenotype [16–18]. Interestingly, in these individuals there is also evidence of a dynamic methylation landscape at theFMR1locus. In some cases, during the creation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), cells from these individuals can gain methylation at the locus [19,20]. This has been linked to instability in the CGG repeat itself; in one instance the gaining of methylation was only seen in clones which also experienced further expansion of the CGG repeat [19]. Further characterisation of UFM cells lines reveals that both UFM and PM carriers have higherFMR1expression levels than individuals within the 30–55 repeat units range but counter-intuitively, lower FMRP levels [21]. This molecular phenotype sometimes does not affect the individual, however in some cases it can lead to FXTAS or FXPOI in PM individuals [5,22,23] (Fig.1).



Variation in the FMR1 promoter and expression in human and mouse. Observed variation in CGG repeat length, methylation status, transcript and protein levels in human (on the left) and mouse (on the right)

These findings suggest that like the humanised FXS mice, perhaps human UFM carriers lack a particular factor required for establishing DNA methylation at theFMR1locus. In this study, we profile the transcriptomes of two unrelated UFM carriers, a full mutation (FM) carrier and a healthy control to investigate this phenomenon. We focus on genes with epigenetic modifying function and particularly those involved in DNA methylation to see if there is any differential expression that could explain the lack of methylation in UFM carriers. The results of our analyses revealTET3as a promising candidate. It has DNA binding capacity, it plays an important role in DNA methylation and is significantly downregulated in UFM carriers.

4 fibroblast cell lines were cultured for this study, 1 healthy control with a repeat length < 55x, 1 FXS control with a methylated CGG repeat > 200x and 2 UFM carriers with unmethylated CGG repeats > 200x. These lines have previously been described [16–20]. Each fibroblast line was cultured in triplicate to create three experimental replicates for RNA extraction and sequencing. One culture well of each UFM cell line was harvested for DNA extraction and whole genome sequencing Fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM + Glutamax (Gibco) with 15% HIFBS (Gibco), 0.1 M non-essential amino acids (Gibco), 100 U/mL penicilin-streptomicin (pen/strep, Gibco™). Cells were kept in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Medium was changed every other day and cells were passed once a week using 0.25% trypsin (Gibco) + 0.01% EDTA.

RNA from fibroblasts was isolated in 400 µl TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen™) according to manufacturer’s recommendations. Samples were treated with DNAseI (Roche) and cleaned using the DNA Clean & Concentrator™-5 Kit (ZYMO Research). Libraries for the UFM 1 samples were prepared with the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA (Illumina) with Ribo-Zero ribosomal RNA depletion, and sequenced paired-end, 75 bp on a NextSeq 550 system (Illumina) by MAD: Dutch Genomics Service & Support Provider (Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, Amsterdam). The UFM 2 RNA samples were sent for ribosomal RNA depletion library preparation and sequencing at genomescan (https://www.genomescan.nl/).

RNA data was analysed using the public Freiburg Galaxy server [24,25], usegalaxy.eu). Trimmomatic was used to remove adapters and trim reads [26] version 0.36.5 for paired-end reads (ILLUMINACLIP TruSeq3 paired-end), the cut option was set if average per base quality in a 4-base sliding window was below 20, and reads below 30 bases were dropped. Reads were mapped to the built-in reference genome hg38 using HISAT2 [27] (Galaxy Version 2.1.0 + galaxy3). Reads were assigned to gencode V36 features using featureCounts [28] (Galaxy Version 1.6.3) with -p, -d 75 -D 900 -B -C. The featureCounts output was analysed using DESeq2 [29] (Galaxy Version 2.11.40.3) with default settings. De novo transcript assembly was performed using stringtie (Galaxy Version 2.1.1) without using a reference guide [30]. bamCoverage was used to generate coverage tracks for both strands (Galaxy Version 3.0.2.0, with deepTools2 (Version 3.0.2) and samtools (Version 1.7)) from the deeptools2 package [31] (bin size 1). Coverage tracks were scaled on UCSC with a scaling factor based on the number of uniquely assigned reads from HISAT2. Replicates were then gathered into track collections on the UCSC and scaled to the replicate with the highest number of uniquely assigned reads from featureCounts, these track collections were used for visualisation. Volcano plots were made in R using the ggplot2 package [32].

DNA was extracted using Quick-DNA miniprep plus kit™ (ZYMO Research) according to the manufacturer instructions. DNA was then sent to the Hartwig institute for library preparation and sequencing using the NovaSeq6000 system (Illumina).

Whole genome sequencing data was analysed using the public Freiburg Galaxy server ([24,25], usegalaxy.eu). Adapters were removed and reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic [26] version 0.36.5 for paired-end reads (ILLUMINACLIP TruSeq3 paired-end), the cut option was set if average per base quality in a 4-base sliding window was below 20, and reads below 30 bases were dropped. Reads were then mapped against built in genome hg38 using BWA MEM (Galaxy version 0.7.17.1) [33] using default settings. The resulting BAM file was sorted by coordinate using SortSam (Galaxy version 2.18.2.1) from the SAMtools package [34] and default settings. Variant calling was performed using FreeBayes (Galaxy version 1.3.1) [35] against the built in hg38 reference genome. The resulting VCF file was then filtered using SNPSift filter from the SNPeff package (Galaxy version 3.4) [36], variants with a read depth below 10 and a quality score below 30 were excluded. The VCF file was then normalised using bcftools norm (Galaxy version 1.10) [37] and annotated with the dbSNP variant names using SNPSift annotate (Galaxy version 4.3 + t.galaxy1) [36]. The VCF file was then visualised on the UCSC genome browser [38]. Ensembl’s Variant Effect Predictor and the dbSNP database were also used to help annotate variants [39,40].

For the comparison of Human and rhesus cortical organoid development, published data from Field et al. [41] was used (GEO:GSE106245) [41]. Data was accessed in a summarised form and basemean values, which had been generated from 2 replicates, were plotted on the graph.

Organoids were generated from the fragile X, methylated full mutation carrier iPSC lines described in De Esch et al. 2014 [20]. FXS iPSCs were grown in StemFlex medium (Gibco). Medium was changed every 2–3 days and cells were passaged every 3–4 days using Versene (ThermoFisher) and medium supplemented with Y-27623 ROCK inhibitor (Tocris). Cells were kept in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The organoid differentiation protocol was based on the methods of Eiraku et al. 2008 [42]. To make embryoid bodies Aggrewell plates were used (Stemcell technologies). 6 million iPSCs were seeded per well in medium supplemented with Y-27623. 24 h after seeding cells were transferred to an ultra low attachment 60 mm plate (Corning) in neuronal differentiation medium (DMEM-F12 (Gibco) supplemented with 20% KnockOut Serum Replacement (Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin/100 µg/ml streptomycin (Gibco), 2 mM GlutaMAX (Gibco), 1x MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids solution (Gibco), 100 µM 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco)) with 8 ng/ml fresh bFGF (Sigma) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco)). 24 h after transfer medium was refreshed with differentiation medium with freshly added 3 µM IWR-1-Endo, 1 µM Dorsomorphin, 10 µM SB-431542 hydrate, and 1 µM Cyclopamine hydrate (day 0 of differentiation), Medium was refreshed with fresh inhibitors every other day. On day 3 of differentiation, organoids were moved to a shaker to prevent clumping. On day 18, the medium was changed to Neurobasal/N2 medium (Neurobasal (Gibco) supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin/100 µg/ml streptomycin (Gibco), 2 mM GlutaMAX (Gibco), 1x N-2 supplement (Gibco)) supplemented with 1 µM Cyclopamine hydrate. From D24, no inhibitors were added anymore to the medium until organoids were harvested. Organoids were grown for 60 days and harvested at day 12, day 36 and day 60.

RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen™) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Potential DNA contamination was removed with DNAseI (Roche) and samples were cleaned using the DNA Clean & Concentrator™-5 Kit (ZYMO Research). qRT-PCR was performed using the QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) with 3 technical replicates for each biological replicate sample in 10ul reactions. The following primers were used, GAPDH was used as a housekeeping gene: ​​TET3_qRT-PCR_F1: CCCACGGTCGCCTCTATC, TET3_qRT-PCR_R1: CTCCTTCCCCGTGTAGATGA, GAPDH_qRT_PCR_01_F1: AATCCCATCACCATCTTCCA, GAPDH_qRT_PCR_01_R1: TGGACTCCACGACGTACTCA.

TET3isoform protein sequences for human, monkey and mouse were downloaded from UCSC genome browser [38]. Protein sequences from annotated transcripts (ENST00000409262.8, ENST00000305799.8, ENSMUST00000089622.11, ENSMUST00000186548.7, ENSMUST00000190295.2, ENSMMUT00000028916.3, ENSMMUT00000028918.4, ENSMMUT00000075204.2) were aligned using clustal omega and default settings [43]. The alignment was then manually annotated based on information published in Iyer et al., 2009 [44].

Human brain developmental expression data was downloaded from the Brainspan atlas of the developing human brain (https://www.brainspan.org/) for bothFMR1andTET3. Mouse brain developmental expression data forFMR1andTET3was downloaded from the EBI expression atlas, specifically experiment ‘E-MTAB-6798: Mouse RNA-seq time-series of the development of seven major organs’ (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies/E-MTAB-6798). The mouse data points were then adjusted to match human developmental time points using the ‘translating time’ website,https://www.translatingtime.org/[45]. Due to the differences in scale across all of the data points from each dataset, the average TPM values across human and mouse were calculated and used to scale the data. These data points were then plotted on a dual axis graph to display the expression pattern over time for the two species.

The lack of methylation in the FXS mouse model suggests that there is a difference in the regulation of methylation between mouse and human at theFMR1locus. The existence of rare UFM carriers offers an unparalleled opportunity to investigate the factors behind the methylation of the CGG repeat expansion unencumbered by the issues associated with inter-species comparison. UFM carriers are quite rare in the human population, but we were able to obtain two fibroblast cell lines generated from genetically unrelated UFM carriers which allowed us to perform a comparative transcriptomic analysis of UFM carriers, FXS patients and healthy controls. The first UFM carrier cell line (UFM 1), contains an unmethylated CGG repeat of approximately 233 repeats in theFMR15’UTR [16,20]. As most expansion carriers possess a mosaic of repeat lengths, this fibroblast cell line has undergone selection to ensure a narrow range of repeat lengths around 230 repeat units. The second UFM carrier cell line (UFM 2) has also been previously reported [17–19] and contains a range of 265–430 repeats.

Transcription at theFMR1locus has previously been studied in cells from individuals with different repeat lengths using qPCR [16,18–20]. However, a full transcriptional profile of the locus in UFM carriers has not previously been generated. The transcriptional profile at theFMR1locus confirms the previously reported molecular phenotypes for the 3 types of cell lines sequenced: Compared to healthy control fibroblasts,FMR1transcript levels were upregulated in both UFM lines andFMR1transcripts were completely absent in the FXS cell line. (Fig.2b, d). The RNA-seq analysis also revealed high levels of a transcript originating from theFMR15’UTR and continuing into the first intron in the UFM carriers. This transcript,FMR1-217has recently been described in FXS cells and thought to play a role in methylation at the locus [46]. This transcript encodes only exon 1 and intron 1 of theFMR1gene, and lacks a clear protein-coding potential, when translated the resulting potential protein has a stop codon after 50 amino acids. However, by targeting this transcript with anti-sense oligonucleotides, researchers were able to restore FMRP levels in FXS cells suggesting it plays a role in the pathology at the expanded locus [46]. TheFMR1-217transcript is also observed at very low levels in healthy control fibroblasts (Fig.2a, b) which is further supported by publicly available RNA-seq expression data (Supplemental Fig.1). The presence of this transcript at noticeable levels in UFM carriers further demonstrates the complexity of the methylation dynamics at theFMR1locus; the presence of high levels of theFMR1-217transcript in UFM carriers implies that it may be necessary but not sufficient to trigger methylation at the locus.

We next investigated differences in the expression of candidate epigenetic modifying genes between the two UFM carriers, a healthy and an FXS control cell line. Given the differences between methylation between mouse and human we would also expect there to be differences in a candidate gene between these species. Based on the above and the presence of methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 and lysine 9 in methylated full expansion carriers [47], we generated a candidate gene list of 44 DNA and histone modifiers which have been associated with changes in DNA and histone methylation (Supplemental Table1).

For the analysis, the three replicates for UFM 1 and the three replicates for UFM 2 were grouped and compared in turn to the healthy control samples (Fig.3a) and the FXS samples (Fig.3b). After the filtering criteria of an adjusted p-value < 0.01 and a fold change greater than 1.5, 35 out of the 44 candidate genes were expressed at high enough levels to compare with the control and FXS samples. The normalised reads for the top three genes from each comparison based on p-value and fold change from the DESeq2 analysis were further investigated (Fig.3c). When compared against the healthy control bothTET3andTET1were downregulated with a fold change greater than 1.5x and an adjusted p-value < 0.01 in the UFM carriers and SET Domain Containing 1B (SETD1B) was upregulated. In comparison with the FXS individualTET3and Enhancer Of Zeste 2 Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 Subunit (EZH2) passed the thresholds and were downregulated in the UFM carriers.

(d) Mapped RNA-seq data showing the raw read data for TET3. Coverage tracks are scaled based on the total number of reads successfully mapped to the genome. Coverage tracks were generated from track collections and show merged tracks from 3 replicates

Upon comparison with both the FXS and unexpanded control we see a robust downregulation of ~ 80% ofTET3in both UFM carriers. This strong downregulation can also clearly be seen in the mapped reads from the RNA-Seq, (Fig.3d) with very low levels ofTET3expression in the UFM lines when compared to control and FXS lines. RNA-seq also reveals that differential expression in UFM carriers is due to an overall decrease ofTET3expression, and not the loss of any particularTET3transcript isoform.

To rule out the possibility that the differential gene expression we observed between the two UFM carriers, the control and the FXS lines is due to the coincidental aberrant expression of these genes in healthy controls and FXS cells, we confirmed in two, unrelated, healthy control fibroblast lines that expression levels ofTET3were similar to the level of the healthy and FXS control cells we used for the initial comparisons (Supplemental Fig.2). Overall, our data points towards a possible involvement ofTET3in the resilience against DNA methylation displayed in both UFM 1 and UFM 2.TET3possesses a CXXC domain which has the potential to bind CGG repeat sequences. Because of this andTET3’s described role in DNA methylation and the aberrant expression observed in UFM carrier fibroblasts,TET3is a candidate contributor to the pathological CGG methylation of theFMR1promoter in FXS patient cells.

It is possible that the observed differences in expression ofTET3in the UFM cell lines are caused by structural variation or a cis acting genetic variant in the coding or non-coding regions of theTET3locus. To assess whether this is the case, we performed high coverage (~ 30x) whole genome sequencing for both UFM cell lines. When compared to the reference genome, both UFM genomes showed a large number of SNPs and small indels. Variant calling was performed for theTET3locus covering approximately 600 kb for both UFM I and UFM II genomes (Fig.4a). We hypothesised that the variant influencingTET3expression levels would be rare (MAF < 0.01) and shared between the two UFM carriers. The variants were filtered for those that were present in both samples and the allele frequencies for the variants were retrieved from gnomAD (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) and dbSNP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/) [40,48].



TET3 variants and expression in the general population. (a) Genomic variants for TET3 for both UFM cell lines in the TET3 locus ~ 600 kb showing the genes, TET3 eQTLs and SNPs found in both UFM carriers with a MAF < 0.01 (b) The 4 SNPs in or adjacent to TET3, showing 2 in the introns, one in the 3’UTR and one just downstream. The Genotypes for UFM1/UFM2 are written below the SNP names (e.g. T/C, T/C)

Across the locus there were 263 shared variants between the two UFM carriers with either heterozygous or homozygous differences when compared to the hg38 reference sequence. Of these 263 variants, 14 have an allele frequency < 0.01 (Fig.4a). Both UFM carriers are heterozygous for all of the observed variants except for 2 variants in UFM2 that are homozygous for the rare allele (rs56768895 CA > C, rs828890 TT > A). None of these variants have any predicted or reported clinical significance. However, there are 3 variants which fall within the gene body ofTET3, one of which (rs72818011) is in the 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR) ofTET3(Fig.4b). While no effect of this variant has been published, SNPs in the 3’UTR of genes have been linked with changes in mRNA stability [49,50]. It is possible that this rare variant, shared by both UFM carriers, could be affecting the stability of theTET3mRNA which could explain the lower transcription levels in these individuals. However, further analysis is needed to test whether any of the observed variants might be having an effect on the expression ofTET3or whether other variants which lie outside of the genomic range of this analysis could be driving the observed differences inTET3expression.

Since humanised FXS mice fail to establish methylation of the expanded CGG repeat, we next investigated potential evolutionary changes in the expression pattern and genomic structure of theTET3protein between human, a non-human primate and mice. A multiple sequence alignment revealed some differences in the protein sequence of all isoforms present in human, rhesus and mouse (Supplemental data). However, none of these changes fall in regions predicted to affect the catalytic domain and the function ofTET3in any of the species (Fig.5a). Based on this result, it can be assumed that any differences must be in the regulation and expression ofTET3rather than in the DNA itself.

(e) TPM expression values for FMR1 in the human and mouse dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at different age points

To investigateTET3regulation dynamics in relation to timing of methylation at the FXS FMR1 locus, we next assessed the expression profile ofTET3in human and rhesus embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and ESC-derived neuronal cortical organoids using published data [41]. Expression is initially low in both human and rhesus ESCs but rises upon differentiation (Fig.5b). No apparent changes in the temporal expression pattern of rhesus and humanTET3was observed, suggesting that the expression dynamics ofTET3are highly conserved in primate lineages. Supportive of this data, cortical organoids derived from FXS iPSCs also show this pattern, with initial low levels ofTET3expression followed by an upregulation upon neuronal differentiation (Fig.5c). This upregulation can be seen to persist for at least 60 days of neuronal differentiation (Fig.5c) which is the point when FXS ESCs gain methylation at theFMR1CGG repeat expansion [11]. The increase inTET3expression which coincides with the methylation time point of the CGG repeat may indicate an important role forTET3in this process, but further validation is needed to support this hypothesis.

Finally, expression data forTET3over time was compared between mouse and human. The translating time model was used to normalise the different gestation periods and developmental time points between the species to enable a direct inter-species comparison between developmental timepoints [45]. The y-axes for the human data points were scaled to enable a comparison of the pattern of expression with the mouse samples. In the human data there is a clear peak inTET3expression between approximately 80 and 120 post conception days (PCD) (Fig.5d). On the other hand, mouseTET3expression lacks a similar peak of expression, but reaches its maximum level expression at a timepoint equivalent to 50 human PCD after which it decreases over time (Fig.5d). Interestingly, in human we see an increase inFMR1expression at the same time as the peak forTET3(Fig.5e). This difference in expression pattern suggests that there could be significant differences in the regulation ofTET3expression between mice and humans which may in turn affect methylation at the expandedFMR1CGG repeat. Even though our data suggests that regulatory changes may account for the differential expression ofTET3between mice-human and UFM carriers and controls, our observations remain associative. Therefore, more research is needed to understand why UFM carriers display significantly lower levels ofTET3, as a candidate gene for establishing CGG methylation in theFMR1locus in FXS patients.

In this study we profiled the transcriptome of twoFMR1CGG UFM carriers. Our analysis supports and builds upon previous studies looking into transcription at theFMR1locus and brings greater resolution to our understanding of the transcription pattern at theFMR1. We show an overall increase in expression levels in UFM carriers and confirm the presence of theFMR1-217transcript in UFM cell lines. Our differential gene expression analysis focused on genes with a role in epigenetic modification and revealed thatTET3, a gene with a role in methylation, is strongly downregulated by about 80% in two unrelated UFM carrier cell lines.

The high resolution expression profile we generated of theFMR1locus confirms and better defines what other studies reported earlier: UFM cell lines show increased expression ofFMR1-transcripts [16,18–20]. We also observed a truncated transcript ending inFMR1intron1, recently identified asFMR1-217[46]. This transcript is sporadically found in other transcriptomes, however, the expression of theFMR1-217transcript seems to be expressed at particularly high levels in UFM carriers. Even though only two UFM carriers were analysed, the expression level of this transcript correlates with the size of the CGG repeat expansion: in UFM2, which has a larger CGG expansion, we see higher levels than in UFM1. In FXS patient cells this transcript is not detected at all and it has been suggested that the presence ofFMR1mRNA including this transcript is necessary to trigger methylation of the locus [11,46]. This is interesting in the context of the UFM carriers as they have expression of this transcript and yet the CGG remains unmethylated. This suggests that this transcript alone is insufficient to trigger methylation at the locus. Interestingly, this phenomenon of repeat driven intronic transcription is not unique toFMR1, it is also observed in other repeat expansion disorders where repeat driven transcription is often a pathogenic mechanism [51,52].

Based on our analyses,TET3is a strong candidate for involvement inFMR1methylation. It is strongly downregulated in the UFM carriers and becomes highly expressed in the window when the expandedFMR1repeat gains methylation. AlthoughTET3is also highly conserved in mice, the expression patterns across developmental time differ between the two species which hints towards species-specific regulatory properties which could underlie subtle differences in function. A previous exome comparative analysis on UFM, FXS and control did not find any significant mutations in the epigenetic machinery genes nor in the proximal regulatory sequences ofFMR1[18]. Our analysis of WGS data from both UFM individuals reveal a variant in the 3’UTR ofTET3that could have an effect on mRNA stability levels, but further testing is required to see if this is the case. It is also possible that the TET3 regulating variant we seek is also present in the healthy population, in this instance it would be difficult to find the causal mutation when comparing to the reference sequence.

The TET enzymes are a family of methylcytosine dioxygenases.TET3consists of a CXXC domain which recognises and binds to specific GC-rich DNA sequences and also a catalytic domain which plays a key role in the establishment of the 5-hydroxymethylated cytosine (5hmC) DNA modification by converting 5mC to 5hmC [53]. The catalytic domain ofTET3plays an important role in its function, howeverTET3has also been shown to have a function independent of the catalytic domain. While the function of the catalytic domain is traditionally associated with the process of the removal of DNA methylation, cell lines with aTET3knockout have been shown to exhibit a global decrease in methylation levels, specifically at gene promoters [54,55]. This localised hypomethylation has been further investigated in a study comparingTET3knockout mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) with mESCs that contained a version ofTET3with a non-functioning catalytic domain, which revealed that in both conditions, differentially methylated regions were hypomethylated suggesting thatTET3is required for methylation at specific gene promoters. This study found that DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is a direct target ofTET3and that withoutTET3,DNMT1was downregulated [55]. This is in stark contrast to an assumed role of TET enzymes in DNA demethylation, where the opposite would be expected. This observation offers a mechanism through whichTET3could operate in the mechanism of methylation at the FMR1 locus. Reduced levels ofTET3result in a downregulation and lack of sufficientDNMT1which is needed to methylate the CGG expansion (Fig.6).



Potential model for the role of TET3 in repeat methylation at FMR1 with an expanded CGG repeat. (a) In individuals with higher levels of TET3, the enzyme potentially functions in both a catalytic and non-catalytic role to affect methylation levels at the FMR1 CGG repeat expansion. Utilising the catalytic domain, TET3 may be directly responsible for the establishment of 5hmC at the locus. In a non-catalytic function, TET3 directly regulates DNMT1 expression which in turn is responsible for methylation at the FMR1 CGG repeat expansion. (b) In individuals with reduced TET3 levels, there is insufficient enzyme to establish and maintain high levels of 5hmC at the FMR1 promoter. The lower levels of TET3 also affect DNMT1 expression leading to a depletion in DNMT1 activity and lower levels of methylation at the FMR1 locus

It is also possible thatTET3influences methylation at theFMR1CGG repeat expansion through the establishment of 5hmC itself. 5hmC was initially thought to be a transitional state of DNA demethylation. Recent studies show, however, that 5hmC is also a stable epigenetic mark which is enriched in the brain [53,56]. Interestingly, 5hmC has also been shown to be enriched around the CGG repeat in the neurons of FXS patients [57]. Therefore, It is possible thatTET3plays a crucial role in the establishment of 5hmC (and possibly 5mC) at the expandedFMR1locus. Even though the exact mechanism remains elusive, lower levels ofTET3could lead to a reduction or lack of DNA methylation at theFMR1promoter in UFM carriers (Fig.6). Taken together, the studies inTET3knockout mice suggest that as opposed to the other TET enzymes,TET3may be required for the establishment of DNA methylation, a distinct functional characteristic that is in agreement with the observed deficits ofTET3expression in UFM carriers.

The nature and timing of methylation at theFMR1locus raises many difficulties in the study of methylation dynamics at the expanded CGG repeat. There are very few cell lines where this is possible. Naïve reversion of FXS iPSCs has been shown to reactivate expression at the locus and remove methylation [58]. However, this has been shown to be a result of contraction of the CGG repeat and remethylation does not occur upon differentiation back to primed cells. In addition, the instability of the CGG repeat makes iPSCs derived from UFM carriers unreliable model systems as in some cases they have been shown to gain methylation after iPSC conversion [19,20]. This instability and dynamic methylation pattern at the FMR1 locus which has been observed in both UFM cells and FXS ESCs has led to the suggestion that the threshold of > 200 CGG repeats is too low for stable methylation to be established at the locus and that the threshold should instead be raised to > 400 CGG repeats [59]. It has been questioned whether UFM lines represent true FXS lines that have escaped methylation or simply cell lines that fall under the methylation threshold. However, the instability of the FMR1 CGG repeat locus and methylation status in these lines has been well shown and these cells are a useful tool with which to study the mechanisms underlying methylation dynamics at the locus. Despite these limitations, we believe that our identification ofTET3as a candidate in the role ofFMR1CGG repeat methylation is robust and a novel finding in the field which has the potential to deepen our understanding of the methylation dynamics of the CGG repeat in theFMR1locus.

Our study offers a unique insight into the transcriptomes and genomes of two UFM carriers. We show a high resolution overview of transcription atFMR1locus, highlighting intronic transcripts expressed in high levels specifically in the UFM carriers. Our differential gene expression analysis shows a strong downregulation of ~ 80% forTET3in two unrelated UFM carriers when compared to controls. Both UFM carriers have a variant in theTET33’UTR that has the potential to influence mRNA stability and could account for the observed differential expression. Loss or knockdown ofTET3in mice has been associated with loss of DNA methylation particularly at gene promoters, similar to the location of the CGG repeat in theFMR1locus. These effects have been linked to both the catalytic function ofTET3in converting 5mC to 5hmC and a non-catalytic role of the enzyme binding to specific promoters. Taken together, the findings described in this study put forwardTET3as a prime candidate for mediating the methylation of the CGG repeat expansion in FXS. While further research is needed, the identification of an epigenetic factor responsible for the silencing of theFMR1locus may have important consequences for our understanding of FXS as well as the development of future therapeutic strategies.

This study aimed to quantify the frequency of individual and team contact events during rugby union match play in top domestic and international men’s and women’s competitions.

In top domestic and international women’s and men’s rugby union competitions, players generally experienced similar numbers of contact events per playing position per FGE.

However, differences observed in some positional groups may significantly affect the total number of contact events experienced per FGE when transitioning between domestic and international competitions and the exposure to certain contact events across a competitive season.

Data presented provide a reference for practitioners working in top women’s and men's leagues across the world with which to guide conditioning of players for the demands of the game, whereas policymakers can use the information to inform decisions regarding player welfare, for example, strategies to reduce exposure to the most frequently occurring high‐risk contact events.

Rugby union is a contact team sport played by both men and women globally. Contact events, such as the tackle, occur frequently during match play (Paul et al.2022; Hendricks et al.2018), thus success ratios (e.g., completed vs. missed tackles) and outcomes related to physical dominance (e.g., breaking an attempted tackle) are associated with team performance (Scott et al.2023; Bennett et al.2021). Within both women’s and men’s rugby union, the highest proportion of injuries also occur during tackles, ball‐carries into contact and rucks (Williams et al.2022; Starling et al.2023; West et al.2022; Burger et al.2020; King et al.2019). Hence, contact events, particularly the tackle, have been a specific focus of injury mitigation research in recent years (Cross et al.2019; Davidow et al.2018; Meintjes et al.2021).

Given the association of contact events with both performance and injury, the frequency of contacts that players may be involved in during match play is important information. Such information can be used in the physical preparation of players (Paul et al.2022; Dane et al.2022) both in single competitions and transitioning between competitions (e.g., from domestic to international; Beard et al.2019; Tierney et al.2021) and for designing position specific rehabilitation programmes (Villarejo et al.2013; Sclafani and Davis2016). Furthermore, from the perspective of governing bodies, understanding the contact events that players are exposed to during a match and at different levels of competition may help guide legislation, either individually, or in conjunction with other data sources. For example, combining contact event data with head acceleration event data can provide estimates of head acceleration exposure for different positions across matches, seasons and playing careers (Tooby et al.2023). Such information may provide greater granularity with respect to a player’s risk of injury than current guidelines, which have been led by minutes played or match inclusions (Williams et al.2023,2017).

Despite the benefits of understanding contact event frequencies to a wide range of stakeholders, previous research in this area has mostly been restricted to low sample sizes, single teams or competitions with a bias towards male participants (Paul et al.2022; Dane et al.2022). Furthermore, the grouping of players into individual positional groups is inconsistent between studies limiting the comparisons that can be made (Paul et al.2022; Dane et al.2022). Thus, more research is required to understand players' exposure to contact events during matches, across competitions and sexes using standardised data collection and analysis methods. Using a single data source and evidence‐based positional groupings, the aim of the present study was to quantify and compare the frequency of individual and team contact events during rugby union match play in top domestic and international women’s and men’s competitions.

A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted in rugby union players competing in top domestic and international competitions (i.e., established competitions at the highest level of domestic or international) across the world. Competitions were included if they were established (i.e., running for a number of years) and data were available from a commercial sports performance analysis company, StatsPerform (Chicago IL, United States). Competition and player information are provided in Table1. Players were included whether they were a starter or a substitute. Accounting for the specific position played by players during each match, players were clustered into the following positional groups (Quarrie et al.2013); front five, back row, halfbacks, outside back, and centres (Table1). A total of 255,300 attacking rucks, 74,853 defensive rucks, 138,879 ball‐carries, 242,100 tackles, 38,366 lineouts, 21,990 scrums and 14,558 mauls were analysed across 32,038 player matches. Ethics approval was received from the university ethics committee (Ref: 123887).

League and player information for the 22/23 domestic and international seasons.

Match play contact event data were taken from Opta data (> 95% of all matches in each competition) using StatsPerform (Chicago IL, United States), a commercial sports performance analysis company which provides performance analysis data to numerous competitive sports leagues worldwide. Opta data were extracted online (https://www.optaprorugby.com/index.php) as Extensible Markup Language (XML) files. Contact events were coded by StatsPerform’s expert analysts at an individual level (individual contact events) including tackles, ball‐carries, attacking and defending rucks and at a team level (team contact events) including lineouts, scrums and mauls (Perform2023). Opta data have demonstrated high interobserver reliability within football for team events, with kappa values of 0.92–0.94 (Liu et al.2013). There has yet to be a similar investigation undertaken in rugby union, but data are used and trusted by professional clubs, broadcasters and other commercial organisations worldwide and are used in many studies in rugby union (Scott et al.2023; Bennett et al.2021,2019).

To estimate the frequency of contact events during rugby union match play, generalized linear mixed models were used. Two types of models were produced: one for individual contact events (attacking rucks, defensive rucks, carries and tackles) and one for team contact events (lineouts, mauls and scrums). Individual contact events were provided at the fixture level per player, with team contact events provided at the fixture level per team. This differentiation was necessary as the coding practices of Opta did not provide details of the individual players involved in these contact events. Within these types of models, two analyses were run: one considering differences between individual competitions and one considering differences between competition types (e.g., domestic/international) by sex. Consequently, four models were run in total.

For individual contact events, a negative binomial distribution was assumed. When comparing between individual competitions, contact event, positional group, competition and the logarithm of minutes played were used as fully factorial fixed effects. When comparing between types of competition and sex, contact event, positional group, sex, type of competition and the logarithm of minutes played were used as fully factorial fixed effects. The logarithm of minutes played was used in both models as it provided a better model fit than the raw minutes played and allowed contact event counts to be estimated per full game equivalent (FGE) whist accounting for the fact that individual players played different minutes. The random effect structure was consistent in both models, with random intercepts added for player ID (to account for repeated measurements within players) and fixture ID (to account for repeated measurements within fixtures).

For the team contact events, a Poisson distribution was assumed. When comparing between individual competitions, contact event and competition were included as fully factorial fixed effects. When comparing between types of competition and sex, contact event, competition type and sex were included as fully factorial fixed effects. As these analyses were conducted at the team level, there was no requirement for minutes played covariate to be included. In both models, fixture ID was included as a random effect.

Results are reported as least square means [95% confidence intervals] per FGE of match play (Williams et al.2023; Sawczuk et al.2024). Indicative differences were identified when the confidence intervals of the estimates did not overlap (Noguchi and Marmolejo‐Ramos2016). Statistical analyses were completed in R (version 4.3.2) using theglmmTMBpackage (Brooks et al.2017).

In men (Figure1A; TablesS1andS3), front five players were involved in fewer defensive rucks in Top 14 (3.6 [3.4–3.8]) and Premiership Rugby (3.3 [3.1–3.5]) than in Men’s 6 Nations (5.0 [4.4–5.8]), fewer attacking rucks in all domestic European competitions compared to Men’s 6 Nations and fewer tackles in Top 14 (10.4 [10.0–10.8]) and URC (12.3 [11.8–12.7]) in comparison to Men’s 6 Nations (14.2 [12.8–15.7]). Back row experienced more defensive rucks in Men’s 6 Nations (7.2 [6.3–8.2]) than in the Top 14 (4.6 [4.4–4.8]), URC (5.5 [5.3–5.8)] and Premiership Rugby (5.8 [5.4–6.1]), greater numbers of attacking rucks in Men’s 6 Nations (17.2 [15.5–19.1]) than Top 14 (13.3 [12.7–13.8]), and a greater number of tackles in Men’s 6 nations (16.0 [14.4–17.8]) than in Top 14 (12.2 [11.7–12.7]) and URC (13.8 [13.2–14.3]). The number of lineouts was similar between domestic and international competitions. Super Rugby (8.3 [7.9–8.8]) had fewer mauls than the Rugby Championship (12.4 [10.9–14.1]), whereas there were fewer scrums in Premiership Rugby (13.0 [12.5–13.5]) than in the Men’s World Cup (14.4 [13.6–15.3]).

In women (Figure1B; TablesS2andS4), front five players Farah Palmer Cup had significantly fewer attacking rucks (12.8 [12.0–13.6]) and tackles 11.0 [10.3–11.8]) than most other competitions, AP15s had lower tackles (12.0 [11.5–12.6] than Women’s 6 Nations (14.1 [12.8–15.6]), whereas international competitions were similar for all contact events. Back rows were involved in similar numbers of contact events in domestic and international competitions, except for defensive rucks, where the Women’s 6 Nations (6.7 [5.9–7.7]) were more frequent than in AP15s (5.1 [4.7–5.4]) and Farah Palmer Cup (5.0 [4.6–5.5]). For team events, Farah Palmer Cup had the lowest lineouts (20.9 [19.7–22.1]) and mauls (4.3 [3.9–4.8]) but the highest number of scrums (21.8 [20.6–23.0]) per FGE. Team events between AP15s and international competitions were not different except for mauls, of which AP15s were lower (8.8 [8.3–9.3]) than the Women's World Cup (10.5 [9.5–11.5]).

When comparing men and women (Figure1C; TablesS5andS6), women’s front five were involved in more ball‐carries in domestic (7.1 [6.8–7.4] vs. 5.7 [5.7–6.0]) and international (7.4 [6.9–7.9] vs. 5.6 [5.2–5.9]) match play, whereas men’s front five were involved in more attacking rucks (17.5 [17.2–17.8] vs. 14.9 [14.3–15.4]) during domestic competition. Women’s players had greater ball‐carries (8.5 [7.9–9.1] vs. 7.3 [6.8–7.7]) and attacking rucks (17.4 [16.4–18.5] vs. 14.6 [13.9–15.4]) during international competition and greater tackles (14.6 [14.0–15.2] vs. 13.5 [13.2–13.8]) during domestic competition. Men’s domestic match play had more lineouts (28.1 [27.7–28.5] vs. 22.5 [21.8–23.2]) and mauls (11.2 [11.8–11.4] vs. 7.4 [7.0–7.7]), whereas women’s domestic (18.6 [18.0–19.2] vs. 14.5 [14.3–14.7]) and international (17.4 [16.4–18.4] vs. 13.7 [13.0–14.4]) competitions had a greater number of scrums.

For men (Figure2A; TablesS1andS3), during Men’s 6 Nations (10.6 [9.2–12.2]) halfbacks were involved in more tackles than in Top 14 (8.0 [7.6–8.5]) and United Rugby Championship (8.3 [7.8–8.7]). Similarly, centres were involved in fewer ball‐carries in the Top 14 (5.4 [5.1–5.7]) and Premiership Rugby (5.8 [5.4–6.2]) than the Men’s 6 Nations (7.7 [6.7–8.9]) and fewer tackles in Top 14 (8.6 [8.2–9.1]) than Men’s 6 Nations (11.4 [10.0–12.9]). Furthermore, centres in Men’s 6 Nations (11.4 [10.0–12.9]) performed a greater number of tackles than those in the Rugby Championship (8.1 [6.9–9.6]) and a greater number of ball‐carries (7.7 [6.7–8.9]) than in the Rugby Championship (5.5 [4.5–6.6]) and Men’s World Cup (5.9 [5.4–6.5]). In Super Rugby, centres performed more tackles (10.9 [10.2–11.6] vs. 8.1 [6.9–9.6]) and attacking rucks (8.8 [8.2–9.4] vs. 6.6 [5.5–7.8]) than in the Rugby Championship. Outside backs performed more ball‐carries in Super Rugby (6.9 [6.5–7.4]) than the Rugby Championship (5.0 [4.3–5.9]) and more defensive rucks in Super Rugby (2.2 [2.0–2.4]) than the World Cup (1.5 [1.3–1.7]).

For women (Figure2B; TablesS2andS4), halfbacks were involved in more attacking rucks (5.1 [4.5–5.7] vs. 4.0 [3.6–4.4]) and defensive rucks (2.5 [2.2–2.9] vs. 1.7 [1.5–1.9]) in Farah Palmer Cup compared to AP15s and more attacking rucks in Farah Palmer Cup than WXV1 (5.1 [4.5–5.7] versus. 2.8 [2.1–3.9]). Centres were involved in more ball‐carries in Farah Palmer Cup than AP15s (7.7 [7.0–8.4] vs. 6.1 [5.7–6.6]), lower defensive rucks in Farah Palmer Cup compared to the Women’s World Cup (2.6 [2.3–2.9] vs. 3.9 [3.3–4.5]) and lower tackles in Farah Palmer Cup compared to Women's 6 Nations (10.9 [10.2–11.6] vs. 14.1 [12.4–16.0]). Outside backs were involved in a similar number contact events in all competitions.

When comparing men and women (Figure2C; TablesS5andS6), women’s halfbacks were involved in more defensive rucks during domestic competition (2.0 [1.8–2.2] vs. 1.5 [1.4–1.6]), more attacking rucks in both domestic (4.4 [4.1–4.7] vs. 2.6 [2.5–2.7]) and international (4.2 [3.8–4.7] vs. 2.9 [2.6–3.2]) match play and more tackles during domestic matches (10.2 [9.6–10.7] vs. 8.4 [8.1–8.6]). For centres, women’s players were involved in more attacking rucks in both domestic (9.2 [8.7–9.8] vs. 7.8 [7.5–8.0]) and international (9.6 [8.9–10.5] vs. 7.7 [7.2–8.2]) competition and a greater number of tackles in match play at both domestic (11.5 [10.9–12.2] vs. 19.6 [9.4–9.9]) and international (12.6 [11.7–13.6] vs. 10.0 [9.4–10.6]) levels. In outside backs, women’s players were involved in greater attacking rucks during international competitions (6.6 [6.1–7.2] vs. 5.4 [5.1–5.8]) and greater tackles during domestic competition (7.6 [7.2–7.9] vs. 6.0 [5.9–6.2]).

The aim of the present study was to describe the frequency of individual and team contact events during rugby union match play in top domestic and international women’s and men’s competitions using a single data source and evidence‐based positional groups. For both women’s and men’s rugby union, competitions generally had similar numbers of contact events per playing position and similar trends were observed when comparing women’s to men’s rugby union. Where differences were observed, most ranged between 0.5 and six per contact event type per FGE. However, the accumulation of contact events during a match for certain positional groups may have a significant impact. For example, a front five player called up from a Farah Palmer Cup team to play in WXV1 could be involved in up to 11 more contact events per FGE on average. Furthermore, the small differences between competitions per FGE may accrue across matches and thus result in higher exposures over the full duration of a competition. For example, a front five player in Premiership Rugby may make approximately 48 more tackles over 20 matches than in Top 14. Data presented in the present study provide a reference for practitioners working in top men’s and women’s leagues across the world on which to condition their players for the demands of the game, both in single competitions and transitioning in between. Furthermore, policymakers can use the information presented in this study to guide decisions regarding player welfare, for example, strategies to manage exposure to the most frequently occurring high‐risk contact‐events.

In the women’s competitions analysed, both forwards and backs had similar numbers of individual contact events per FGE during domestic match play in comparison to associated international competition for the most part (Figures1and2). Where statistical differences were observed, absolute differences ranged from approximately 0.5 to 5 contact events per FGE. Similar trends were observed for international competitions and domestic competitions when considered separately. Nevertheless, recent research in the women’s game has demonstrated associations between collision outcome and physical characteristics such as body mass, strength and power (Woodhouse et al.2023). Although no comparisons in physical characteristics have yet been made between playing levels in women’s rugby union (Curtis et al.2023), data from women’s rugby league suggest that international players have greater anthropometric (height, body mass and fat‐free mass) and physical (strength, speed, power and aerobic capacity) qualities than domestic players (Scantlebury et al.2022). Thus, it is possible that differences between domestic and international women’s rugby may be more pronounced with respect to contact event intensity than the number of contact events. However, future research is required to clarify this.

For team events in the women’s game, both Farah Palmer Cup (4.3 [3.9–4.8]) and AP15 (8.8 [8.3– 9.3]) had a lower number of mauls than the Women’s World Cup 10.5 (9.6–11.5), whereas Farah Palmer Cup also had less mauls than WXV1 (9.3 [7.9–11.0]) per match. Given that the maul produces a significant amount of neuromuscular and metabolic stress (Morel et al.2015), forwards in these competitions may require additional position‐specific conditioning to optimally prepare for international match demands. Interestingly, Farah Palmer Cup had more scrums than any other women’s competition. As scrums primary result from mistakes in play (e.g., knock on), this difference may represent differences in the skill level (i.e., amateur vs. semi‐professional competitions).

Similar to the results in women’s rugby, overall results for men’s rugby demonstrated similarity between competitions with respect to the individual contact events that different playing positions were involved in per FGE (Figures1and2). Although previous research exploring match demands in rugby union is typically hard to compare due to the plethora of methods used (Curtis et al.2023), data from the same players competing in multiple competitions and playing levels suggest that match demands are greater at higher levels of competition (Tierney et al.2021). In particular, the microtechnology‐derived accelerometer data that accumulates from collisions during match play have been shown to be highest in international competitions and greater in higher levels of club competitions (e.g., Pro14 vs. British and Irish Cup) (Tierney et al.2021). Therefore, it is possible that although many positional groups were involved in a similar number of contact events across competitions, the intensity of these collisions may differ. Furthermore, the intensity or magnitude of collisions can be determined by the body load, or head accelerations event, measured using instrumented mouthguards (Jones et al.2022).

Where differences among competitions were observed in men’s rugby union, the majority were between European domestic competitions and the Six Nations. Given that the Six Nations is played every year alongside domestic European competitions, it is important for physical preparation and rehabilitation practitioners to take stock of these differences when preparing players to transition between competitions (Beard et al.2019; Tierney et al.2021). This is particularly important for Top 14 players where the results demonstrated that front five had significantly fewer defensive rucks, tackles and attacking rucks; back row experienced fewer defensive rucks, attacking rucks and tackles; halfbacks were involved in less tackles and centres partook in less ball‐carries and tackles than in the Six Nations.

With respect to team contact events, the vast majority were similar between competitions. The notable exceptions were the number of mauls in Super Rugby (8.3 [7.9–8.8]) and scrums in Premiership Rugby (13.0 [12.5–13.5]), which were lower than in the Rugby Championship (12.3 [10.8–14.0]) and men’s World Cup (14.4 [13.6–15.3]), respectively, and all other domestic leagues.

For a large proportion of contact events and positional groups, no differences were observed between women’s and men’s rugby for an FGE at either domestic or international level. Where differences were present, women’s rugby players tended to have a higher (approximately 0.5–4) number of individual contact events per FGE of competition. For the forwards, these differences were mainly seen in ball carries and attacking rucks (Figure1), whereas in backs, differences primarily occurred in tackle and attacking ruck events (Figure2). The current findings are similar to the movement characteristics of match play, for which men’s and women’s are relatively equivocal (Jones et al.2015; Bradley et al.2020). Nevertheless, recent data from instrumented mouthguards have demonstrated the difference in head acceleration event magnitude between men’s and women’s forwards and backs during tackles, ball carries and rucks (Tooby et al.2023; Roe et al.2024). Contact events during men’s rugby had a greater propensity for resulting in a head acceleration event across all magnitudes investigated, suggesting that the collision intensity during the men’s game is significantly greater (e.g., between 2.82 and 3.32 times greater at higher magnitudes). Thus, although for certain events and positions, women’s players may be involved in slightly more contact events per match, the physical cost of contact is likely greater for men.

For team events, at a domestic level, there were more lineouts (28.1 [27.7–28.5] vs. 22.5 [21.8–23.2]) and mauls (11.1 [10.8–11.3] vs. 7.4 [7.0–7.7]) in the men’s game, which may reflect a preference to kick more. Conversely, there were more scrums in women’s rugby at both domestic (18.6 [18.0–19.2] vs. 14.5 [14.2–14.8]) and international (17.4 [16.4–18.4] vs. 13.7 [13.0–14.4]) levels, which may reflect a greater number of handling errors in the women’s game.

Both a strength and a limitation of the present study is the use of a single source of video analysis data commercially available from Opta (Stats Perform, London, United Kingdom). Currently, no reliability studies have been conducted on Opta data in rugby union, and a reliability assessment was not undertaken in the present study. However, Opta data have shown high reliability in football with kappa values of 0.92–0.94 (Liu et al.2013) and are trusted by professional clubs, broadcasters and other commercial organisations worldwide and are used in many studies in rugby union (Scott et al.2023; Bennett et al.2021,2019). Additionally, the analysis undertaken in the current study presented data per FGE only. As can be seen in Figures1and2, even when confidence intervals overlapped, point estimates often differed. Thus, it is possible that these differences would have been magnified if multiple games were modelled (e.g., a half or full season). Therefore, future research is required to determine how contact events may accumulate across matches and competitions using longitudinal analysis techniques. Also, FGEs were used to allow for direct comparisons between competitions. Future studies may benefit from using other ways of normalising playing time, such as median playing time of starters. Moreover, only counts of contact events were considered within the present study. Measures of contact intensity are required to paint a full picture of the contact demands in and between competitions. Where differences were identified, further research is required to explore factors that may contribute to these differences (e.g., in‐game contextual factors such as skill level and discipline). Finally, as larger datasets with more leagues become available, and changes to competitions occur, such as increased professionalism and rules modifications, the analysis undertaken in the present study will require updating.

The differences in contact events between competitions spanned a narrow range (approximately 0.5–six per contact event per FGE) for both women’s and men’s players. However, the summation of these differences across the different contact events within a match may have a significant effect on certain positional groups. For example, a front five player called up from a Farah Palmer Cup team to play in WXV1 could be involved in as much as 6 more attacking rucks, 3 more tackles and 5 more mauls per game on average (Figure1). Similarly, a Top 14 back row player, who is selected for a Six Nations squad, on average may be exposed to up 3 more defensive rucks, 4 more attacking rucks, 4 more tackles and 1 extra maul per match (Figure1). The physiological cost of these additional contact events within a single match may have a substantial impact on fatigue during competition (Morel et al.2015) if players are not adequately prepared. Furthermore, such fatigue may compound across a competition and result in underperformance or predispose to injury. Accordingly, the data presented in this study may help guide practitioners working in top men’s and women’s leagues across the world in the physical preparation of players for the demands of the game, both in single competitions and transitioning in between.

Additionally, small differences between competitions may accrue across matches and thus result in far greater exposures across the full duration of a competition. For example, a front five player competing in Premiership Rugby may be expected to make more tackles on average per full match than in the Top 14 (Figure1). Across 20 full game equivalents, this would equate to 48 more tackles. Given that the tackle is the contact event in which most injuries occur during rugby union match play (Williams et al.2022), a front five player may be at greater risk of injury when playing in Premiership Rugby or in the initial period after joining a team in Premiership Rugby from Top 14. Accordingly, policymakers can use the information presented in this study to guide decisions regarding player welfare, for example, competition‐specific seasonal match limits (Williams et al.2017) to reduce exposure to high‐risk contact events.

The aim of the present study was to describe the frequency of individual and team contact events during rugby union match play in top domestic and international men’s and women’s competitions using a single data source and evidence‐based positional groups. Although a high proportion of contact events per FGE were similar between competitions and sexes, differences that were observed may have important implications for players transitioning between competitions and the long‐term exposure of players to higher‐risk contact events. Data presented in this study provide a reference for practitioners working in top men’s and women’s leagues across the world with which to guide conditioning of players for the demands of the game, both in single competitions and transitioning in between. Furthermore, policymakers can use the information presented in this study to guide decisions regarding player welfare, for example, strategies to reduce exposure to the most frequently occurring high‐risk contact events.

Here, cryotherapy is often used to alleviate pain, but its underlying pain physiological effects are under-researched. This study aims to explore whether a 3-min cryochamber application results in cryo-induced hypoalgesia.<h4>Methods</h4>24 healthy male participants successfully conducted this randomised controlled crossover study consisting of a 3-min WBC (cryochamber at -87°C) and a 3-min control (ambient temperature) session. Pressure pain thresholds (PPT [Newton/cm<sup>2</sup>]) were measured at the rectus femoris, knee joint, deltoid muscle and sternum pre and post0, post5, post15 and post30.<h4>Results</h4>Results revealed a significant 'condition' × 'time' interaction (p < 0.001, η<sup>2</sup> <sub>partial</sub> = 0.280) for PPT<sub>Total</sub> (pooled for one average value) with hypoalgesia observed after WBC (p < 0.001; pre: 77.0 ± 17.2, post0: 89.6 ± 18.6, post5: 83.6 ± 19.4, post15: 83.1 ± 18.2, post30: 80.8 ± 17.7) and no change following the control (p = 0.873; pre: 75.1 ± 18.8, post0: 75.3 ± 19.4, post5: 74.6 ± 19.2, post15: 75.7 ± 19.3, post30: 75.3 ± 19.1). The same pattern was observed for individual landmarks. Between-group differences were consistently observed, with higher values following the WBC.

Whole‐body cryotherapy (WBC) is a treatment that involves exposing the entire body to extremely cold temperatures and is used in therapeutic and sports scientific settings. Here, cryotherapy is often used to alleviate pain, but its underlying pain physiological effects are under‐researched. This study aims to explore whether a 3‐min cryochamber application results in cryo‐induced hypoalgesia.

24 healthy male participants successfully conducted this randomised controlled crossover study consisting of a 3‐min WBC (cryochamber at −87°C) and a 3‐min control (ambient temperature) session. Pressure pain thresholds (PPT [Newton/cm2]) were measured at the rectus femoris, knee joint, deltoid muscle and sternum pre and post0, post5, post15 and post30.

Results revealed a significant ‘condition’ × ‘time’ interaction (p< 0.001,η2partial= 0.280) for PPTTotal(pooled for one average value) with hypoalgesia observed after WBC (p< 0.001; pre: 77.0 ± 17.2, post0: 89.6 ± 18.6, post5: 83.6 ± 19.4, post15: 83.1 ± 18.2, post30: 80.8 ± 17.7) and no change following the control (p= 0.873; pre: 75.1 ± 18.8, post0: 75.3 ± 19.4, post5: 74.6 ± 19.2, post15: 75.7 ± 19.3, post30: 75.3 ± 19.1). The same pattern was observed for individual landmarks. Between‐group differences were consistently observed, with higher values following the WBC. No significant ‘time’ × ‘intervention’ × ‘landmark’ interaction effect (p= 0.439) was found.

This study demonstrates that a three‐minute cryochamber exposure induces robust hypoalgesia in healthy participants, as indicated by increased PPT, lasting up to 30 min but gradually declining over time.

Whole‐body cryotherapy significantly induces short‐term hypoalgesia, with increased mechanical pain thresholds lasting up to 30 minutes. Compared to ambient temperature, cryotherapy provided greater pain relief across multiple body landmarks, with 82.6% of participants experiencing hypoalgesia. These findings highlight the potential of cryotherapy for pain management and support further research on its long‐term efficacy and clinical applications.

Cold applications have gained increasing interest in research and especially in the sports and clinical fields due to their proposed benefits in pain management and recovery enhancement (Jdidi et al.2024; Patel et al.2019). A whole spectrum of different cold modalities exists, ranging from localised applications with ice packs to more systemically effective forms such as, for instance, cold‐water immersion or cryochambers (Bouzigon et al.2016). These modalities leverage the physiological response of various bodily systems to cryogenic temperatures, which include, among others, vasoconstriction and a reduction in nerve fibre conduction velocity for the alleviation of pain and inflammation (Herrera et al.2010; Swenson et al.1996). Afterwards, vasodilatation of the microvasculature leads to an increase in body temperature above baseline levels, a phenomenon that may persist for an extended period of time (Dębiec‐Bąk et al.2013). Furthermore, an upregulation of parasympathetic activity measured by means of heart rate variability can be observed after termination of whole‐body cryotherapy (Louis et al.2020). Cold exposures are administered to athletes to positively manipulate regeneration and reduce muscle soreness after training and competition (Bleakley et al.2012; Versey et al.2013). From a medical point of view, cryotherapy can be utilised as an acute or long‐term non‐pharmacological treatment option for pain due to its analgesic potential (Kunkle et al.2021).

One specific type of whole‐body cryotherapy (WBC) involves staying inside a cryochamber. A cryochamber is an enclosed space where individuals are subjected to extremely cold temperatures ranging from −60°C up to −140°C for a brief duration, up to a maximum of usually 3 min (Dębiec‐Bąk et al.2013; Stanek et al.2018).

As mentioned before, pain modulation is one crucial and often exploited benefit of acute or repetitive cold exposure. To investigate changes in pain perception across various settings, pressure pain thresholds (PPT) are frequently used, with higher PPT indicating less pain sensitivity. Assessment of PPT offers an experimental and semi‐objective method for evaluating an individual's pain sensitivity (Böing‐Meßing et al.2022; Tomschi, Schmidt, et al.2024), providing localised and tissue‐specific responses to experimental and clinical interventions such as cold exposure. The body of evidence on the effects of cryogenic temperatures on pain thresholds is sparse and currently limited to localised application methods (Algafly and George2007; Curković et al.1993; Macedo et al.2015; Vargas E Silva et al.2019). To the best of the authors' knowledge, it has not been determined empirically whether whole‐body cryotherapy modulates an individual's pain sensitivity.

Based on the above‐mentioned considerations, this study seeks to explore whether a 3‐min cryochamber application of −87°C results in cryo‐induced hypoalgesia. More particularly, the following research questions are stated: (1) Does a cryochamber application result in acutely increased mechanical PPT (i.e., hypoalgesia) compared to a control condition? (2) How long does the potential increase in PPT last? (3) Do tissue‐specific differences in PPT exist?

This study was carried out as a randomised controlled cross‐over trial in which participants conducted one cryochamber and one control session in a randomised order (Figure1). Simple randomisation was used for the random allocation sequence, and blinded allocation was ensured using a randomisation system by an independent researcher. To avoid any carryover effects, a washout period of at least 7 days was administered.



Schematic overview of the study design. HR, heart rate; PPT, pressure pain thresholds.

In the first visit, the contents of the study were explained and participants provided written consent. Then, PPT measurements were performed to familiarise participants with this assessment to avoid any confounding results due to the novelty of the measurement. Following that, participants changed their clothing. For protection and discretion, participants wore their own underpants, a hat, gloves, socks, shoes and a medical face mask. This clothing pattern was standardised for both conditions and across all measurement time points. Further, to prevent excessive cooling of the body, entering the cryochamber was only permitted when the skin surface was completely dry. PPT and local temperature were measured in a seated position prior to the experimental phase (Pre). Participants were then instructed to march slowly for 3 min, either in the cryochamber cooled to a constant temperature of −87°C (cryochamber intervention) or in a quiet room at ambient temperature (control condition). During the experimental phase, heart rate (HR) was monitored. Subsequently, PPT, temperature and HR were assessed immediately post the experimental phase (Post0), after 5 min (Post5), 15 min (Post15) and 30 min (Post30). Reporting of this study was performed according to the CONSORT checklist for randomised controlled crossover trials (Dwan et al.2019) and no changes to methods after inclusion of the first participant were done.

This study was conducted in accordance with the principles of good clinical and ethical practice and was approved by the local ethics committee (Number: SK/AE 230109, date of approval: 27 January 2023). Along the Declaration of Helsinki, participants were informed in detail about the study protocol prior to the examination and were required to give written informed consent.

Based on a priori power analysis conducted with G*power (Version 3.1.9.4) with a predefined alpha level of 0.05, a power of 0.8, and a moderate effect size off= 0.25 (equalsd= 0.5), the recruitment of at least 22 participants was required. Given that, to date, no study has assessed PPT applying whole‐body cryotherapy, we chose the aforementioned standardised moderate effect size. To account for potential dropouts of approximately 10%, a total of 25 healthy male individuals were recruited and enrolled in the study. Eligibility for study participation required the submission of written informed consent, being male, and an age of at least 18 years. In addition, participants were excluded if they took pain medication regularly or had taken any pain medication 24 h prior to examination. Participants were also asked to refrain from performing any type of vigorous exercises 48 h prior to any study visit that might induce muscle soreness. Finally, the presence of a disease contraindicated for the cryochamber (e.g., PAD, CHD, bronchial asthma, Raynaud's disease) or being diagnosed with a musculoskeletal disease (e.g., osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis) precluded participation.

PPT were examined using a digital pressure algometer (Wagner Instruments, Greenwich, Connecticut, USA). Studies have shown excellent inter‐rater reliability for PPT assessment in healthy individuals at different body regions (Jayaseelan et al.2021; Waller et al.2015). The precise assessment procedure was similar to the study conducted by Tomschi et al. (2022), with the adjustment that each landmark was assessed twice consecutively. In short, the pressure was constantly increased (10 Newton/s) until the subject verbally indicated that the pressure first became painful. Peak pressure was set at 120 Newton/cm2to avoid the risk of tissue irritation. At each landmark, two measurement series were conducted, and the average value was used for statistical analyses. Higher values indicate a lower level of pain sensitivity.

To ensure standardised assessment of outcomes, the body areas were marked prior to the first measurement series. Landmarks assessed for PPT comprised the rectus femoris muscle (RF) at the centre of the distal third between the patella base and the anterior superior iliac spine (Vaegter et al.2018) and the lateral area of the acromial part of the deltoid muscle (DM) (Persson et al.2004) as muscular measurement points. The knee joint (KJ) between the medial condyle of the femur and the medial condyle of the tibia (Tomschi, Ransmann, et al.2024) and the sternum (ST) two finger widths above the xiphoid process were determined as non‐muscular measurement points (Tomschi et al.2023). All PPT measurements were performed in the same presented sequence. PPT assessment of each participant was carried out by the same investigator.

The skin surface temperature was measured using an infrared non‐contact thermometer (FIT‐10 Thermometer, PCE, Meschede, Germany) consistently before the assessment of PPT at the exact same landmarks as described above. The probe was placed at the designated landmark, and temperature readings were recorded to the nearest 0.1°C. This specific thermometer was selected because it is portable, inexpensive, easy to use, and fast to use and demonstrated good inter‐rater reliability in a similar model (ICC = 0.80) (Packham et al.2012).

HR (Polar m400; Polar Electro OY, Kempele, Finland) was monitored in 10 s intervals throughout the experimental phase and at each aforementioned measurement time point.

Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS 29 (Armonk, NY, USA) for Windows with a predefined alpha level ofp≤ 0.05. Figures were created using RStudio (version 4.2.3), primarily utilising the package ‘ggplot2’. Data was initially tested for normal distribution employing Shapiro–Wilk tests and by inspection of Q–Q plots. As PPT represents the main outcome variable and distributions failed to elicit normality in some cases, the data were log10‐transformed as recommended by Rolke (Rolke et al.2006) and were, hence, presented as mean and standard deviation.

Subsequently, to analyse the effect of the cryochamber intervention compared to the control condition on PPT across all measurement time points, a 2 × 5 ANOVA was performed for the mean PPT of all landmarks (PPTTotal). To check for sphericity, Mauchly's Test was performed, and in case of heterogeneity of variances within groups, Greenhouse–Geisser correction was used. Further, a three‐way ANOVA with the main factors ‘time’ (Pre, Post0, Post5, Post15, Post30), ‘condition’ (Cryochamber, Control) and ‘landmark’ (RF, DM, KJ, ST) was conducted to analyse the distinct effects of the two interventions on PPT over time and to analyse whether the hypoalgesic effects are dependent on the measurement site assessed. In case of significant differences, LSD post hoc tests were applied (Lee and Lee2018). Effect sizes were calculated as partial eta‐squared (η2partial) and interpreted as follows:η2partial≥ 0.01 = small effect,η2partial≥ 0.06 = medium effect,η2partial≥ 0.14 = large effect (Cohens1988).

Lastly, responsiveness to the cryochamber intervention was determined by comparing post measurement data for PPT to Pre‐values relative to the standard error of measurement (SEM). To compute SEM values for each landmark, both Pre‐values for each condition were used, applying the following formula:SEM=SDpooled*1−ICC, with ICC meaning the intraclass correlation coefficient. For this analysis, only participants with baseline PPT values smaller than 120 Newton (upper cut‐off) minus SEM were considered, as only these data allow for the identification of true responders.

In the course of this study lasting from March 2023 to November 2023, one drop‐out was recorded. One participant terminated the cryochamber intervention before the 3‐min duration due to discomfort, and data from this participant are not included in any analysis. No further events nor any adverse events or harms were observed. Therefore, a total of 24 healthy males successfully completed the study and were subsequently analysed. Subject characteristics, including data regarding the cryochamber intervention, can be obtained from Table1. No subject had experience with WBC, nor did any subject report regularly performing cold exposures. Seven participants reported having experience with cold exposures, such as cold showers or cold water immersion.

For PPTTotal, the two‐way ANOVA demonstrated a significant interaction effect (p< 0.001,η2partial= 0.280). Respective post hoc pairwise comparisons revealed for the cryo chamber intervention that PPTTotalvalues significantly decreased from Pre to Post0 (p< 0.001), from Pre to Post5 (p= 0.001), from Pre to Post15 (p= 0.003), and from Pre to Post30 (p= 0.035). In the control condition, no significant changes were observed between Pre and any post‐intervention time points (allp> 0.582). Comparisons between the cryo chamber and control conditions at each time point showed no differences for PPTTotalat Post0 (p= 0.290). Significant differences were observed at Post0 (p< 0.001), Post5 (p< 0.001), Post15 (p= 0.001) and Post30 (p= 0.001) (Figure3).

Results of the three‐way ANOVA yielded significant ‘time’ × ‘condition’ interaction effects (p< 0.001,η2partial= 0.293). Pairwise post hoc testing for this interaction effect revealed higher Post0 (p< 0.001), Post5 (p= 0.001), Post15 (p= 0.002) and higher post30 (p= 0.025) values following the cryo chamber intervention compared to Pre. No such differences were observed for the control condition for any post time point (allp> 0.567). Besides, significant differences were observed between both interventions for Post0 (p< 0.001), Post5 (p< 0.001), Post15 (p= 0.001) and Post30 (p= 0.002), but not for Pre (p= 0.318). The respective post hoc test results of landmark‐specific PPT are presented in Figure4. Additionally, results showed no significant interaction effect for ‘time’ × ‘condition’ × ‘landmark’ (p= 0.439,η2partial= 0.041), ‘landmark’ × ‘condition’ (p= 0.397,η2partial= 0.042) and ‘time’ × ‘landmark’ (p= 0.248,η2partial= 0.052). Descriptive data of raw data and log10‐transformed data of PPT are presented in TablesS1andS2, respectively.

The immediate response to the cryochamber intervention showed that 82.6% of participants experienced an increase in PPT values (exceeding the SEM) between the Post0 and Pre assessments for PPTTotal. At the RF, KJ, DM and ST, the proportion of immediate responders amounted to 82.6%, 72.2%, 56.5% and 87.0%, respectively (Figure5). Additional data, including the number of responders clustered by landmarks and across all time points, are presented in TableS3.

Outliers are displayed separately.

The primary aim of this study was to explore whether a 3‐min exposure to a cryochamber cooled to −87°C results in cryo‐induced hypoalgesia in healthy individuals. Besides, it was evaluated how long these results last and whether differences between PPT outcomes measured at bony and muscular landmarks exist. The results indicate a significant increase in PPT in general and at specific muscular and bony landmarks immediately after the cryochamber intervention compared to the control condition. Hence, cryo‐induced hypoalgesia was observed in this study. A significant elevation in PPT relative to baseline values was observed for up to 30 min post intervention for PPTTotal, though with a gradual decline over time. However, the duration of the cryo‐induced hypoalgesic effect varied between landmarks, with the longest‐lasting effect detected at the ST, up to 30 min after leaving the cryochamber. Effects of the cryochamber intervention on pain perception appeared to not be dependent on the landmark assessed as no significant interaction effect was found. Moreover, the observed hypoalgesia for PPTTotalwas found to be robust, with 82.6% of participants being classified as responders.

The analgesic potential of cryogenic environments has been studied repeatedly in various patient populations, yet pain‐related outcomes are mostly limited to pain scales (Adie et al.2012; Garcia et al.2021; Gizińska et al.2015; Silva et al.2022). However, little is known about the effect of cryogenic temperatures on experimental pain metrics such as pain sensitivity. Algafly and George investigated the impact of a locally applied ice pack to the ankle joint on pain sensitivity and pain tolerance. The authors concluded that when skin temperatures were reduced to 15°C and 10°C, pain sensitivity decreased with pain thresholds being significantly elevated (Algafly and George2007). This observation was explained by the authors by the cooling‐induced reduction in afferent nerve conduction velocity (NCV). They suggested that NCV decreases progressively with reductions in skin temperature, with an average NCV reduction of 33% from baseline to 10°C equating to a 0.4 m/s decrease per 1°C drop in skin temperature (Algafly and George2007). In the present study, this slowing of signal transmission of primary afferent nerve fibres most likely also happened due to the observed reductions in skin temperature (see Table2). This might have artificially elevated PPT due to delayed nociceptive input processing. If the signal transmission from the peripheral stimulus site to the brain were slowed on a biophysical level, the actual mechanical pressure applied at the time of perception may have exceeded the true pain threshold. This effect would occur independently of a genuine hypoalgesic response, instead representing a distinct mechanism that contributes to the observed hypoalgesia. However, future studies are needed to evaluate NCV or alternative pain assessment methods to clearly differentiate potential methodological influences from true analgesic effects of cryotherapy.

In a separate study by Vargas E Silva et al., pain sensitivity and pain tolerance thresholds were measured following unilateral application of a thermal gel pack to the right knee joint for 20 min, with the contralateral site serving as an unmanipulated control. Despite uniformly increased thresholds at all landmarks assessed, statistically significant elevations in PPT were only observed at two out of the six measurement sites, despite significant temperature reductions at all landmarks (Vargas E Silva et al.2019). In the present study, for the first time, PPT were measured after application of a three‐minute whole‐body cryotherapy within a cryochamber cooled to −87°C. Whole‐body cryotherapy differs from the above‐mentioned localised cryotherapy applications by providing systemic rather than localised cooling. Whole‐body cryotherapy involves exposing the entire body to extremely low standardised temperatures resulting in a rapid reduction in skin surface temperature, and it triggers a cascade of not only localised but also central (e.g., central nervous system related) physiological responses (Cholewka et al.2006; Louis et al.2020). It is suggested that whole‐body cryotherapy induces a complex endocrine response characterised by an increase of certain neurotransmitters, along with adaptations on the metabolic and hormonal level (Nasi et al.2020). Although not directly measured in the present study, acute endocrine responses, particularly of cortisol, catecholamines (adrenaline, noradrenaline), and β‐endorphin, may further explain the observed PPT response in the present study from a physiological perspective (Barłowska‐Trybulec et al.2022; Leppäluoto et al.2008; Pertovaara2013). Despite comparable skin temperature reductions of local and whole‐body cryo applications on a local level, it can be assumed that subjecting the entire body to cryogenic temperatures elicits a higher magnitude of transmitter release, resulting in more profound mechanical hyperalgesia. However, both application modalities are known to induce an upregulation of the autonomic nervous system, explaining in part their analgesic effects (Bouzigon et al.2016). Evidence comparing localised to whole‐body cryotherapy modalities is scarce and needs to be elaborated on in further studies.

The results presented herein are concordant with the study by Algafly and George (Algafly and George2007), with PPT being significantly increased in general and at all landmarks immediately post intervention, although absolute local temperatures were on average comparably higher at Post0 (lowest at RF: 20.4; highest at ST: 27.8). The biggest and smallest relative reduction in temperature between Pre and Post were observed at the RF (35.4%) and ST (17.9%), respectively. Interestingly, according to a previous review, skin temperature needs to be lowered to 13.6°C for local analgesia (Bleakley and Hopkins2010). The authors state that reaching skin temperatures that low is difficult, which was mirrored by temperature values achieved after the cryochamber in this study. As our results suggest significant increases in PPT across all landmarks assessed at higher absolute skin temperatures, current recommendations do not apply when pain perception is assessed by means of PPT. Although, it needs to be highlighted that within this investigation only healthy individuals were tested.

It is well established and logically sensible that superficial body temperatures decrease when subjected to ice packs directly applied to the body site assessed or when the body remains in a cryogenic environment for some time. This phenomenon has been widely studied and recognised (Cuttell et al.2017; Hausswirth et al.2013; Louis et al.2020). However, this effect lasts only for a brief time period after withdrawal from the cryogenic environment. The results of the present study substantiate these findings. Superficial temperatures were significantly reduced at Post0 compared to baseline values for all landmarks examined. However, temperature exponentially increased after 5, 15 and 30 min, respectively. Physiological processes are initiated as a consequence of extreme cooling of the body to account for the homeostatic control of body temperature regulated mainly by neurons residing in the hypothalamus (Zhao et al.2017).

Analogous to changes in temperature, exposure to cryogenic temperatures induces an immediate positive chronotropic effect on the heart. HR increased by 40.7% upon entering the cryochamber from baseline measured during the control condition and remained significantly elevated immediately after withdrawal from the cryochamber (+22.4% compared to baseline), albeit with an incipient decrease. These findings are in concordance with a recent study by Coppi and colleagues (Coppi et al.2022) that explored the response of the cardiovascular system to 2‐min whole‐body cryotherapy, in which a 10.6% increase in HR was observed in non‐professional athletes.

The main strengths of this study are that the pain physiological phenomenon of cryo‐induced hypoalgesia was evaluated in a randomised and controlled crossover design by the use of semi‐objective PPT. Besides, the use of a cryochamber with a predefined temperature of −87°C ensures highest standardisation of applied temperatures, which can be seen as superior to other cryotherapy methods or localised applications. However, some limitations need to be acknowledged. First, due to the nature of the cryo‐application, blinding of the participants and tester was not possible. Second, the effects of the cryo‐application were measured up to 30‐min post. Future research should aim to also explore more delayed (e.g., 24‐h post) effects of cryogenic application methods on pain perception. Third, this study aimed to explore a physiological phenomenon and only healthy male participants were included, thus limiting the generalisability of the results observed. Future research should aim to reproduce this study in, for instance, pain patients. Fourth, this study explored the acute effects of a cryo‐application on pain perception and no assumptions on chronic effects (e.g., resulting from repetitive multi‐week exposures) can be drawn from this work. Future research should therefore investigate whether repeated exposures to cryogenic temperatures within a cryochamber also result in habituation in terms of experimental pain perception. Fifth, experimental pain stimuli are limited to mechanical pressure applications and no conclusions can be drawn regarding other stimulus types (e.g., thermal or chemical). Lastly, this study was not prospectively registered.

This study for the first time demonstrated that a 3‐min exposure to a cryochamber cooled to −87°C results in general robust cryo‐induced hypoalgesia with increased PPT compared to a control condition. This hypoalgesia was observed immediately after the intervention and persisted for up to 30 min, though it gradually declined over time. Importantly, no significant differences in the response were found between different landmarks, suggesting that the cryochamber intervention had a consistent impact on pain perception across measurement sites. These results suggest that whole‐body cryotherapy represents an effective, non‐invasive method for providing short‐term pain relief that should be replicated in patients with chronic or acute pain conditions.

This article designs a high-altitude border guard post that can fully utilize the heat absorbed by solar collectors to continuously store thermal energy during the day and stably release heat at night. This device is a spherical encapsulated paraffin phase change heat exchanger device (stainless steel shell diameter: 80mm),By conducting thermal storage and release experiments on the device, the performance of the device was analyzed. The experimental results showed that in the thermal storage experiment, the outlet temperature of the hot fluid reached about 97 °C at about 500 minutes and tended to stabilize. The wall temperature and center temperature of the encapsulated paraffin sphere began to stabilize at about 450 minutes and stopped absorbing heat; In the heat release experiment, the wall temperature and core temperature of the encapsulated paraffin spheres stabilized at about 400 minutes and stopped releasing heat; In this way, it can meet the heating needs of storing heat for about 8 hours during the day and continuously releasing heat for 6.5 hours at night.

The highland and alpine border post area is known as “no birds in the sky, no grass on the ground, wearing cotton jackets all year round, not enough oxygen to eat, sunburned skin, wind-blown stone running.” The natural environment is extremely harsh. The natural environment is extremely harsh, characterized by very cold temperatures but very rich solar energy resources. The area where the border post is located (in Tibet, for example) in winter has the lowest temperature down to −40 °C, part of the annual average temperature below −10 °C. However, the daytime sunshine in such areas is very cold but very rich in solar energy resources. However, these areas are very sunny during the day and have long hours of sunshine. Still take Tibet as an example. Tibet is China and even the world’s richest region of sunlight energy in a province. Solar energy resources are very rich, in which the most abundant solar irradiation in the region of direct solar radiation is in the 6700 ~ 8370 MJ/m2per year, equivalent to 230 kg standard coal combustion of the heat emitted by the [1]. At present, the heating in the border guard post area mainly relies on coal-fired heating, and most of the coal needs to be transported from the mainland by highway and railroad, and it is difficult to raise all kinds of fuels locally, so the traffic and road conditions in the area have a direct impact on the guarantee of heating. In terms of heating methods, centralized heating is not suitable for decentralized barracks and field stations, and the use of independent heating facilities is not energy-efficient, resulting in high operating costs. When there is a lack of energy supply, heating in these areas often relies on firewood or cow dung as fuel, which completely fails to meet the requirements of the construction of energy-saving and ecological camps. Based on the sunshine conditions in such areas, solar energy has become an ideal renewable energy source to be utilized, and solar thermal conversion technology has become a major initiative for sustainable development. Therefore, in China’s highland alpine post areas, the use of solar heating is a very effective and convenient method.

Solar thermal energy storage technology is categorized into sensible heat storage, latent heat storage, and chemical reaction heat storage according to the thermal energy storage method [2].(1) The sensible heat storage system utilizes the specific heat capacity of the material and the temperature change of the material in the process of energy storage and energy release. The specific heat capacity of the material is approximately constant over a small temperature range, so the greatest advantage of sensible heat energy storage is that the energy storage and release process is completely reversible over the effective service life of the system. Moreover, during the operation of the system, there are fewer instability factors to be considered technically, so the sensible heat energy storage system is simple in structure and easy to operate. However, its most important disadvantage is that its energy storage density is small, that is, the energy that can be stored per unit volume is small, and the volume of the energy storage device is often too large [3].(2) Latent heat energy storage is the use of material in the solidification, melting, condensation, gasification, sublimation, and other forms of phase change processes that are to be absorbed or released as latent heat of the phase change principle of heat storage, so it can also be called phase change energy storage. From the point of view of energy density, latent heat storage is much larger than the heat stored in the sensible heat [4].(3) Chemical reaction energy storage is to use the reaction heat of a reversible chemical reaction to store energy; this way of energy storage density is larger, but the technology is complex and inconvenient to use. Therefore, the storage capacity of phase change energy storage is higher than sensible heat energy storage, and the technology is simpler than chemical reaction energy storage.

Phase change storage technology attracts a lot of research on it by virtue of its superiority, and the development momentum is strong. Phase change energy storage technology is based on phase change energy storage materials as the basis of high technology, phase change materials Phase change latent heat is large, much larger than the apparent heat energy storage density. In the process of storing and releasing energy, the material occurs in isothermal or nearly isothermal conditions, the temperature and thermal energy are basically stable, and they can be used as a basis for the development of industrial energy-saving system systems and high-tech products to meet the people of the system and the products’ special performance and cost requirements [5–8].

For the research of phase change materials since the 1970s, continuous and systematic research has been carried out at home and abroad on traditional phase change materials such as inorganic salts, inorganic water-containing salts, and metals. The Tibet Solar Energy Research and Demonstration Center, in cooperation with Central China Normal University, has successfully developed solar energy high energy storage density phase change materials by mixing inorganic water-containing salt materials such as manganese nitrate and borax with nucleating agents in moderate proportions. Currently, commonly used phase change materials include organic materials represented by fatty acids and paraffins and inorganic materials represented by hydrated salts. Paraffin-based phase change materials are stable, non-corrosive, and readily available phase change energy storage materials. Li Xinguo et al. [9] established an experimental system of phase change in a circular outer tube using paraffin wax as phase change material and obtained the phase change law of paraffin wax at different positions during heat storage and exothermic storage as well as the melting time of paraffin wax. Yang Jialin et al. [10] The phase change temperature and latent heat of phase change of paraffin were obtained by measuring the thermophysical properties of paraffin by DSC oscillometric scanning calorimetry using a shell-and-tube phase change heat storage structure as an object. It provides a certain basis for selecting phase change materials with a better heat exchange effect.

A phase change heat accumulator (PCHA) functions as a specialized heat exchanger where thermal performance is optimized by enhancing three key parameters in the heat transfer equation：Q = K·A·∆T (Where Q is the heat transfer rate (W), K is the overall heat transfer coefficient (W/m²·K), A the effective heat transfer area (m²), and ΔT is the temperature gradient (K)). It can be seen that increasing the integrated heat transfer coefficient, increasing the effective heat transfer area, and increasing the difference in temperature of the heat transfer can increase the amount of heat transfer [11]. Decentralized encapsulation of phase change materials is also relatively common in practical applications. Decentralized encapsulation is to use metal, plastic, and other materials made of tubes, balls, plates, and other shapes of the shell, and the phase change material is encapsulated in it, which is most widely used in the form of spherical shell encapsulation. The application is generally more than one phase change material encapsulation body stacked as a bed-type heat storage and through the heat transfer fluid and the outside world for heat transfer, so that the heat storage involves more than one encapsulation body inside the phase change material phase change heat transfer, but also its convection heat transfer with the heat transfer fluid and heat conduction, which is a complex non-steady state heat transfer process. In this article, paraffin of the device with 58.5–62.5°C phase transition temperature maximizes ΔT with 112°C solar heat sources, achieving 41% higher daily storage than those of hydrated salts, 80mm-diameter stainless steel spheres provide 92% packing density and survive -40°C thermal stress, reducing annual efficiency decay to <3%, Foldable baffle design self-adjusts airflow for 27–33 kPa ambient pressure, maintaining 1.45 m/s flow rate without auxiliary power.

As shown inFig 1.The solar phase change energy storage and heat transfer device is composed of stainless steel with an external dimension of 1500*1000 mm, and 471 phase change spheres are loaded inside; the phase change spheres are filled with paraffin waxes with a phase change temperature of 58.5~62.5°C by the stainless steel shell with a diameter of 80mm (the physical parameters are shown inTable 1), and the shell of the 471 spheres is filled with about 85 kg of paraffin waxes; the device is opened with ventilation openings with a diameter of 150mm (one inlet and one outlet) in front of and behind the device. The diameter of the device is 150 mm (an inlet and an outlet); its internal folding plate can be disassembled at any time according to the experimental needs; the device’s box is outside the use of high-density XPS extruded plastic board as a thermal insulation layer.The design of the spherical encapsulation method used in this study is supported by previous research on the optimization of heat transfer in PCM-based systems. Hosseini et al. investigated the effect of geometric and operating parameters on the thermal behavior of shell-and-tube latent heat energy storage systems, providing insights into the design of efficient heat exchangers [12]. Additionally, Hua et al. explored the use of nano-metal/paraffin composite PCMs, demonstrating enhanced thermal conductivity and heat transfer performance [13].



The phase change material used in this experiment is paraffin wax and the physical parameters are shown inTable 1, which will be used in the analysis of the experimental results.

The experimental setup is shown inFig 2, and the functions of each part of the setup are shown as labeled in the figure, where the heating supply fan simulates the temperature and speed of the air coming out of the solar collector.



The experiment is divided into two parts: heat storage experiment and heat release experiment. In the heat storage experiment, the air inlet temperature varied little, with a difference of 6.4°C between the maximum and minimum values, and the average value was 112.03°C, and the flow rate at the outlet was about 1.45 m/s. In the heat release experiment, the air inlet temperature was about 27.2°C, and the flow rate at the outlet was 2.9 m/s.The operating conditions and physical properties for heat storage and release are listed inTable 2.

To ensure transparency and reproducibility,Table 3summarizes the technical specifications of all critical instruments used in the experimental setup. The selection criteria for these devices prioritized measurement accuracy (±0.5°C for temperature, ±2% for airflow), compatibility with alpine operating conditions (-50–260°C temperature resistance), and alignment with the system’s thermal power range (2000–5000 W). Detailed parameters—including sensor types, power requirements, and operational ranges—are provided to facilitate replication of the heat storage/release experiments.

A total of 15 measurement points are arranged in the solar phase change energy storage heat exchanger, which are divided into three parts: 7 temperature measurement points are arranged at the center of the phase change sphere, marked as points 1–7; 6 temperature measurement points are arranged on the outer wall of the phase change sphere, and the temperature line at each point is arranged perpendicularly to the ground, marked as points 8–13; and 2 measurement points are arranged in the entrance and exit of the box, marked as points 14 and 15. As the distribution of the device is an axisymmetric structure, so the third grid in the middle position (folding plate will be the Yangneng phase-change energy storage and heat transfer device is separated into five compartments) as the object of the temperature measurement point layout,Fig 3is the solar energy phase-change energy storage and heat transfer device in-kind diagram of the temperature measurement point layout; and the third grid of the phase-change sphere is also placed in the position of the axis of symmetry, so in order to facilitate the marking of the construction of the third grid of the local schematic diagram will be The temperature measurement points of the physical figureFig 3are marked on the simulation figureFig 4.





In this experiment, the air temperature at the inlet and outlet of the phase change energy storage device was measured. In the thermal storage experiment, it can be seen fromFig 5that the inlet temperature always stays within the range of 110~112.7°C, which indicates that the inlet temperature is relatively stable and is little affected by the ambient temperature. While the export temperature increases with time, after 500 min or so, it is stable. This is due to the phase change sphere temperature being lower than the temperature of the air flowing over its surface during this period of time. The hot air is constantly exothermic to the phase change sphere, so that the temperature of the phase change sphere is gradually increased. In the case of small changes in the import temperature, the heat transfer temperature difference between the air and the phase change sphere gradually decreases, and the phase change sphere gradually reduces the amount of heat absorption, resulting in a gradual increase in the air outlet temperature.



The curve in the figure in 230 ~ 300 min appeared in a period of steep rise. This is due to the phase change sphere in this period of time phase change; the sphere inside the proportion of solid phase gradually decreased, the proportion of liquid phase is increasing, and the phase change material paraffin wax in the liquid state of thermal conductivity is only 1/2 of the solid state; that is to say, with the increase of the proportion of liquid in the phase change sphere body, the heat absorption of the phase change sphere is reduced, resulting in the reduction of air exothermic, and the outlet air temperature rises rapidly.

As can be seen from the figure, after 500 minutes, the outlet air temperature of the device tends to stabilize, indicating that the phase-change sphere no longer absorbs heat and the heat storage is completed. It can be seen that the phase change energy storage device can be completed in about 8 hours of heat storage, and daytime sunshine time fits. After 8 hours of heat storage, the temperature difference between the air import and export is basically unchanged, about 14.4 °C, which is caused by the heat loss of the heat storage box. In the late stage of heat storage, the surface temperature of the heat storage box reaches more than 40 °C, while the ambient temperature is about 27.2 °C, which has a large temperature difference in the heat transfer, resulting in a certain amount of heat loss.

The temperature drop (ΔTstorage=Tin−Tout) quantifies heat transfer efficiency from air to PCM. ΔTstoragepeaks at 84.3°C (112°C inlet vs. 27.7°C outlet at t = 50 min) and stabilizes to 14.4°C after 500 min as PCM saturates. This aligns with the phase change completion observed inFig 6.



Fig 6illustrate the temperature changes over time for both the center and wall temperatures of the phase change sphere during the heat storage experiment. It can be observed from the figures that, despite the different positions of the phase change spheres, the trends in temperature change over time are consistent. Initially, both the wall temperature and the center temperature of the sphere increase with time, although the rate of increase is slow. Around 200 minutes, both graphs exhibit a distinct inflection point, at which the temperature reaches approximately 59 °C. Following this point, the temperature rises sharply, indicating that the phase change material is undergoing a phase change. After the phase change, the increase in sensible heat causes a significant rise in temperature. By approximately 450 minutes, the temperature of the phase change sphere approaches that of the hot air, resulting in the cessation of heat exchange.The 450 min stabilization time is governed by paraffin’s low liquid-phase conductivity (kliquid=0.14 W/m·K), which throttles heat transfer during phase change.

Fig 7illustrates the relationship between the import and export air temperatures over time during the heat release experiment. As depicted in the figure, at the initial moment of the experiment, the imported air temperature is significantly lower than the temperature of the phase change sphere. This creates a substantial temperature difference, causing the heat storage ball to release a large amount of heat to the air, resulting in a higher export temperature of approximately 92 °C. However, as the heat storage ball continues to release heat, its temperature gradually decreases. Consequently, the heat transfer between the air and the sphere diminishes, leading to a continuous decline in the export air temperature, indicating that the heat release from the device has been completed.



Fig 8and9illustrate the curves representing the wall temperature and the center temperature of the phase change sphere over time during the heat release experiment. Between 60 and 75 minutes, both figures exhibit distinct inflection points, particularly inFig 9. Following the appearance of the inflection point, the temperature stabilizes, indicating that during this period, the phase-change material begins its phase transition. Approximately 400 minutes into the experiment, all temperatures converge to nearly the same value, around 26°C. This suggests that, at this point, the heat release from the device to the surrounding air has concluded.





It can be observed that the device is capable of continuously releasing heat into the air for approximately 6.5 hours, which meets the requirement for heat release during the night. The 6.5 hour heat release duration is enabled by turbulent airflow (Re = 2900), achieving a Nusselt number Nu=18.3 for efficient heat extraction.

According to the experimental data presented, the thermal power variation over time for both the heat storage and heat release experiments has been calculated, as illustrated inFig 10The figures indicate that the thermal power in both the heat storage and heat release processes decreases over time; however, the rate of decrease in the heat storage process is greater than that in the heat release process. This discrepancy can be attributed to the higher heat loss experienced during the heat storage process, which occurs due to a significant temperature difference between the thermal fluid and the surrounding environment. Consequently, the heat transfer efficiency in the heat release process is superior to that in the heat storage process.



Aiming to address the characteristics of prolonged sunshine duration and low average daily temperatures in alpine regions, we designed and constructed a solar energy phase-change energy storage device. This device facilitates heat storage during the day and releases heat at night through the use of paraffin wax as the phase-change material. The goal is to provide heating to outposts during nighttime.

The performance study of the device, including storage and exothermic experiments, yielded the following results: In the heat storage experiment, the temperatures of the hot air outlet, phase-change sphere core, and wall continued to rise over time, stabilizing between 450 and 500 minutes. This indicates that the device has completed its heat storage phase. In the exothermic experiments, the temperatures of the cold air outlet, phase-change sphere core, and wall decreased over time, stabilizing between 380 and 400 minutes, which indicates that the device has ceased exothermic activity. It can be concluded that this phase-change energy storage device is capable of achieving heat storage during the day for 8 hours and exothermic release at night for approximately 6.5 hours. This performance is sufficient to meet the heating demands of the guard post during nighttime.

These arrangements were stabilized through multiple hydrogen bonds and centroid–centroid stacking interactions occurring between nearly parallel organic cations. Vibrational and optical properties were also explored using FT-IR and UV–Vis methods, respectively. Additionally, thermal analysis was performedviaTGA/DTA and DSC measurements to assess the thermal stability and phase transformation of the title compound. Analysis of the Hirshfeld surface was carried out to examine the interactions between molecules. This allowed a quantitative assessment of the relative contribution of these interactions in the crystal structure. AC conductivity measurements (10−6Ω−1cm−1) confirmed the semiconductor character of the compound. The conductivity mechanism was attributed to the correlated barrier hopping (CBH) mechanism. Furthermore, electrical modulus measurements demonstrated the presence of grain effects.

The AC conductivity response of the [(C9H8N)2(InCl6)·2(H2O)] compound aligns with the Jonscher power law at different temperatures. The decrease inSindicates that the transport mechanism in this material is governed by the CBH mechanism.

In recent years, there have been significant advancements in organic–inorganic hybrid materials owing to their distinct structures combining inorganic frameworks with organic molecules. This combination typically occurs at the molecular level and results in properties that are distinct from those of the individual components.1Because of their hybrid structure, these materials exhibit a wide range of properties, including unusual topological characteristics and superior magnetic, luminescence, catalytic, electrical, dielectric and ferroelectric properties.2–11As per Sanchez's lecture on hybridization, the interaction between the organic and inorganic components in such hybrids is limited to weak bonds, such as hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interaction, or ionic interaction. Such materials are incredibly intriguing as they provide the foundation for productive applications across numerous industries, such as optical sensors, signal processors, organic light-emitting diodes,12electrical conductivity, photochemistry, medicine and photocatalysis.13–21Herein, as a member of the group (III) family, indium was selected for the study as it is a heavy metal that finds extensive utilization in various applications, ranging from industrial sectors22to semiconductors,23gas sensors, and solar cells.24Therefore, organic–inorganic hybrid materials based on indium, such as those with the formula An−3[InIIIXn] (A = organic ammonium cations; when X = Cl or Br,n= 4, 5, or 6; when X = I,n= 4), have attracted attention for their structural diversity and electrical characteristics. In-based organic–inorganic hybrid molecules offer facile synthesis and structural flexibility. Hence, a variety of In3+compounds have been reported.25–28

Inspired by such studies, we present the synthesis, structure, spectroscopic measurements, optical properties, thermal analysis, and Hirshfeld analysis of a novel [(C9H8N)2(InCl6)·2(H2O)] hybrid compound.

An aqueous solution of InCl3·6H2O (99.99% purity, Sigma-Aldrich) was mixed with a solution of quinoline (C9H7N, ≥99% purity, Sigma-Aldrich) in ethanol (≥99.8% purity, Sigma-Aldrich) in an equimolar ratio. The reaction proceeded with a precise stoichiometric ratio, as shown below:2(C9H7N) + InCl3·6H2O + 6HCl → [(C9H8N)2(InCl6)·2(H2O)].

After stirring for 30 min, the mixture was left to dry at room temperature. Within a few days, well-defined brown single crystals were obtained, which were suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis and further studies.

A glass fiber with tiny crystals of the new compound attached to it was affixed to an Agilent Gemini CCD diffractometer. Intensity data sets were obtained using Mo-Kα (λ= 0.071073 Å) radiation at room temperature. Data were collected, and the structures were solved using a direct method through SHELEXS-97.29Based on F2, structural refinements were carried out using SHELXLE30with the Olex-21.5 alpha program.31All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Most hydrogen atom positions were calculated geometrically. The diagrams of the crystal structures and asymmetric units were created using Mercury 3.8.32Table S1†presents partial atomic positions and similar isotropic thermal parameters, while anisotropic displacement parameters are listed in Table S2.†Furthermore, the selected bond lengths (Å) and angles (°) are given in Table S3.†Additionally, in order to identify the morphology and elemental content of the title compound, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was performed using a QUANTA microscope. The phase composition of the sample was verified using a Siemens D5000 powder diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (α= 1.54056 Å) at room temperature and an angle range of 5°–50°. Using the Crystal Explorer software version 21.5, one can determine intermolecular interaction within a crystal structure by utilizing the calculated Hirshfeld surface. This method allows specific molecules to be analyzed in the entirety of the crystal.

Data were gathered using a PerkinElmer FT-IR spectrometer employing KBr pellets in the spectral range of 4000–400 cm−1. The measurement of UV–Vis absorption was conducted at room temperature using a PerkinElmer Lambda 35 UV/Vis spectrophotometer over the wavelength range of 200–800 nm.

A SETARAM DSC 131 ks device (featuring Pt containers and Al2O3as the reference) was used to collect differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) readings of the raw powder. The temperature was increased from room temperature to 800 K at a steady rate of 5 K min−1in a constant stream oxygen atmosphere using 3.121 mg of the sample.

A TGA Q500 TA device was employed to analyze the powdered samples (20.428 mg enclosed in an alumina crucible) over a temperature range from 300 to 1000 K in an O2atmosphere. We maintained a heating rate of 10 K min−1to ensure accuracy of the results.

Sample pellets 8 mm in diameter and 1 mm in thickness were fabricated and thoroughly analyzed to determine the sample's electric properties. The data were collected using a Solartron 1260 analyzer to perform complex impedance measurements. The temperature range tested was 313 to 353 K, while the frequencies ranged from 0.1 to 107Hz. To improve precision, the big faces of the pellet were coated with silver.

SEM micrographs displayed the crystal fragments with a homogeneous distribution and flat surface, indicating their good crystal quality (Fig. 1). EDX measurements of the sample were conducted, and indicated the presence of In, Cl, N, C and O, which were non-hydrogen constituent elements.



Comparison of the measured PXRD pattern and that simulated from single-crystal data verified a single phase without any visible impurities, confirming the remarkable purity of the title compound bulk crystal, as shown inFig. 2.



The title compound crystallized at room temperature was classified as an organic–inorganic hybrid, and its structure adopted the centrosymmetricP1̄ space group. Selected crystallographic parameters and experimental conditions are listed inTable 1.

The unit cell parameters are as follows:a= 7.4718(3) Å,b= 8.1648(5) Å,c= 10.7809(5) Å,α= 76.573(4)°,β= 80.404(4)°,γ= 66.171(5)°, V = 583.22(6) Å3, andZ= 1. As shown inFig. 3, the asymmetric unit of the investigated compound consists of one crystallographically protonated quinolinium (C9H8N)+cation, a half [InCl6]2−and one uncoordinated water molecule.



Hence, upon scrutinizing the atomic configuration present in the crystalline framework of the investigated compound, it could be inferred that the inorganic units were interspersed with organic chains in a sequential manner along the crystallographicb-axis and linked together by O–H⋯Cl hydrogen bonds from the free water molecules situated between the two layers. On the other hand, the packing diagram of the crystal structure along theb-axis illustrated an alternating arrangement of inorganic layers, positioned atx= ½c, and organic chains, extending along the crystallographica-axis atx= 0 andx= 1. Interspersed between these two layers, water molecules contribute to the overall structural stability by reinforcing cohesion through hydrogen bonding and other intermolecular interactions, as projected inFig. 4(a) and (b).



The inorganic part consisted of an octahedral [InCl6]2−unit with In–Cl distances between 2.455(16) and 2.521(3) Å and Cl–In–Cl angles ranging from 87.76(8)° to 92.24(8)°, forming a slightly distorted octahedron.33–36Cl⋯Cl interactions provide the necessary cohesion between the [InCl6]2−anions in the inorganic column. The closest distance between chlorine atoms of the nearest [InCl6]2−entities was 4.225 Å. This weak halogen–halogen contact is sufficient to ensure the cohesion of the inorganic columns and is known to generate weak antiferromagnetic interactions. Regarding the organic component, it consisted of two separate quinolinium organic cations that were protonated. The C–C and C–N distances within this component ranged from 1.337(11) to 1.417(10) Å and from 1.304(9) to 1.368(8) Å, respectively. Four categories of hydrogen bonds are responsible for maintaining the stability and unity of the structure. Furthermore, water molecules play a supplementary role in stabilizing the structure. This is achieved through the N–H⋯O bond and the hydrogenviaC–H⋯Cl and O–H⋯Cl interactions, which provide a link between the cationic (C9H8N)+entities and [InCl6]2−anions. Each cationic group forms two hydrogen connections with two distinct clusters of inorganic moieties, creating a pseudo 3D hybrid class I structure. The hydrogen bonding information can be found inTable 2.

Symmetry codes: (i): −x+ 1, −y+ 1, −z+ 1; (ii): −x+ 1, −y, −z+ 1; (iii):x− 1,y+ 1,z; (iv):x,y,z− 1; (v):x+ 1,y,z− 1; (vi):x− 1,y+ 1,z− 1.

In order to obtain information on the crystal structure and determine the functional groups present, FT-IR spectroscopy was used. Our attention was primarily directed towards analysing the vibrations of the organic cations and water molecules. The process was conducted professionally to ensure accurate results and comprehensive analysis.

The recorded IR spectrum is shown inFig. 5. The bands observed at 3558 and 3481 cm−1were attributed toυ(O–H) vibrations.37Meanwhile, the band observed at 1596 cm−1was responsible for the (O–H) deformation vibration of water molecules, while the band located at 3417 cm−1was related to theυ(N–H) vibrations of protonated quinoline. The bands located at 3051, 1051, 804, and 765 cm−1were related to theυ(C–H) andδ(Created by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019C–H) of the quinoline ring. Furthermore, the (CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019C) stretching band of the aromatic pyridine ring was displayed at 1568 cm−1. The bands observed at 990 and 1614 cm−1were attributed to the (C–H) bending deformation vibration and (CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019N) stretching mode of the pyridine ring. Also, the bands at 1620, 1555, and 1506 cm−1could be recognized asυ(C–N) andυ(C–C) of the quinoline ring, as observed with other similar hybrid compounds.20,35–40



The UV–visible absorption spectrum of the title compound was investigated in the range of 200–800 nm at room temperature (Fig. 6), and it exhibited two absorption bands located at 264 (3.96 eV) and 365 nm (4.74 eV). These two activation energies confirmed the semiconductor character of this compound. The band at 264 nm corresponded to the π–π* and n–π* electron transitions of the coordinated ligand,41while the peak at 365 nm was attributed to excitation from the inorganic layers in [InCl6]2−. This observation was in agreement with previous research on organic–inorganic hybrid materials.35,42Under excitation, electrons transit from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB), creating a hole in the valence band (VB), and emission occurs when the electron and hole recombine.



Next, Urbach tail analysis was conducted to gain an insight into the material's disorganisation. In this situation, Urbach's rule illustrates how the absorption edge broadens and a band tail forms. The Urbach tail energy (EU) is used to assess the width of the tails caused by localised states at the absorption edge.43The Eu value can be found using the following equation:ln(α) = ln(α0) +hν/Eu,whereα0is a constant,EUrepresents the Urbach energy (eV), andhνis the photon energy (eV). As illustrated inFig. 6(b), the tail did not fit a single slope accurately in the ln(α)versusphoton energy plot. The investigated compound exhibited a specificEUvalue (EU= 0.449 eV) that was comparable to other band tails reported in some indium-based hybrid perovskites, such as (CsAgNaInBiCl).44Notably, that compound exhibited a higherEUvalue compared to our hybrid material, potentially due to a higher defect density within the cell.45Consequently, the recombination rate in perovskite compounds increases as theEUrises, likely resulting from the higher density of localized states within the band gaps.

To gain a thorough understanding of the interactions between molecules within the crystal structures, we conducted analyses utilizing Hirshfeld surfaces calculated through Crystal Explorer 21.5.46Electron distribution, which is calculated by adding the electron densities of spherical atoms, serves as the foundation for constructing the crystal structure.47The Hirshfeld surface produced by a specific crystal structure and a set of spherical atomic electron densities is singular.48The Hirshfeld surface is composed of points where the molecule of interest's contribution to the electron density is equivalent to the contribution made by all other molecules.49Two distances,deanddi, are established for each point on the iso-surface. The Hirshfeld surface distance to the closest atom outside the surface is represented by the symbolde. The value ofdirepresents the separation between the closest atom inside the surface and the Hirshfeld surface. The standardised contact distance, ordnorm, is determined by taking into account the atom's vdW andderadii using the following equation:dnorm= (di−rvdWi)/rvdWi+ (de−rvdWe)/rvdWe,wherervdWiandrvdWeare the van der Waals radii of the appropriate atoms internal or external to the surface. Red, blue, and white are the colours used to graphically represent the value ofdnorm, which can be positive or negative based on the intermolecular interactions. The Hirshfeld surface of the asymmetric unit, mapped with thednormproperty, highlights large circular depressions characterized by a deep red color, as shown inFig. 7(a). These depressions serve as indicators of hydrogen bonding contacts, which can be attributed to various interactions, such as N–H⋯Cl, O–H⋯Cl and C–H⋯Cl interactions. Furthermore, the presence of white patches on the surface was attributed to H⋯H van der Waals contacts. The ideal measures for detecting π–π interactions, namely, the curvedness and the shape index, are depicted inFig. 7(d) and (e). For our present compound, the curvedness maps showcase vast flat green areas, emphasized by a bold blue outline encircling the pyridinium cycle.



Fig. 8presents the 2D fingerprint plot using the standard view with the graph's axes displaying the distance scales of de and di obtained through Hirshfeld surface analysis. This graph depicts a summary of the intermolecular contacts in the crystal. A major emphasis here is placed on the H⋯Cl/Cl⋯H intermolecular interactions, which notably contribute to 60.8% of the Hirshfeld surface. Further it is essential to highlight that H⋯H interactions also make a significant contribution to the total Hirshfeld surfaces of the crystal structure, constituting up to 19%. By dissecting the 2D fingerprint plots that highlight the nearby contacts, it becomes possible to reveal and analyze each contribution from the various interactions obtained from the complete fingerprint. The C⋯H interactions can be considered as the third noticeable interactions, accounting for up to 6.90%. Additionally, the C⋯C contacts between the organic cations are in the range of 6% of the total close contacts, which suggests the presence of π–π interactions between the involved atoms. In addition to these interactions, there are also red hollows on the second side of the fingerprint plot, such as N⋯H (1.8 and 1.1%) and N⋯C (0.8%), of the Hirshfeld surface.



Succinctly and based on the quantitative analysis, we could evidently conclude that the predominant contributors to the overall surface are the H⋯Cl/Cl⋯H interactions and the closely packed H⋯H contacts. These interactions serve as the primary driving force within the crystal structure of the new studied hybrid compound.

Next, the thermal stability and breakdown characteristics of the synthesized complex were investigated using DTG-TG/DTA and DSC analyses. These factors hold particular significance in electronic device manufacturing, where a crystal's ability to endure laser light exposure and yield precise results is crucial. We conducted thermal analysis on finely crushed powder samples.

The DSC heating curve was recorded in the temperature range of 300–600 K using 3.12 mg of the sample at a heating rate of 10 K min−1, and the result is displayed inFig. 9.



In fact, three peaks were observed as the temperature increased. The first endothermic peak was detected at 349 K (ΔH= −159.18 J g−1,Ea= 65.40 kJ mol−1) and was assigned to the release of two water molecules. The second endothermic peak in the heating process around 421 K observed in the DSC corresponded to the fusion, with an enthalpy (ΔH) of −52.95 J g−1and an activation energy (Ea) of 78.87 kJ mol−1. The third exothermic peak detected at 443 K (ΔH= 524.81 J g−1andEa= 82.94 kJ mol−1) corresponded to the decomposition of the material. The thermal stability of the crystal was examined using thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis techniques (Fig. 10). The results obtained by these methods were in agreement with each other. The TG curve showed that the substance was stable until it reached 308 K, and, then, it decayed, losing 92.34% of its total initial weight. However, the first loss of mass was related to the dehydration of the two lattices of water (1st loss of mass = 2H2O), which occurred between 308 to 361 K, losing 5.94% of the total initial weight (calculated at 5.77%), which is comparable with other reported hybrid compounds.50–52This loss was associated with two endothermic peaks in the DTA and DTG curves at around 356 K. The fine and intense dip observed in DTA at 424 K indicated the melting point of the substance. It could obviously be noted that the sample decomposed immediately after melting in two stages, which was further verified by the DTA and DTG curves. The second degradation was related to the elimination of the two organic cations (2nd loss of mass = 2(C9H8N)+), which began at 361 K and proceeded until 631 K, and, in this process, 36.54% (calculated at 41.67%) of the total initial mass was lost. This loss of mass was accompanied with an endothermic peak in DTG and DTA at 541 K. Additionally, the third phase of the process happened between 600 and 750 K and involved the pyrolysis of the inorganic anion (3rd loss of mass = 6(HCl)), which further contributed to a mass loss of 49.86% (52.54% calculated). This degradation was accompanied by two endothermic peaks in both DTA and DTG at 716 K. Finally, 7.655% of the total mass was obtained as a result of the decomposition, which may be related to the formation of In2O3residue.



One effective method for characterizing the electrical behavior of a sample is impedance spectroscopy. This method works well for separating the effects of electrode polarization, grain boundaries, and grain contribution. An appropriate equivalent circuit must be proposed in order to demonstrate the material's electrical characteristics and comprehend the response that is received. The Nyquist plots (−Z′′vs. Z′) of [(C9H8N)2(InCl6)·2(H2O)] at temperatures ranging from 313 K to 343 K are shown inFig. 11.



An analogous circuit with two cells representing the grains and the grain boundary in this material yielded the best fit. The first cell consisted of a parallel combination of the resistance (Rgb), capacitance (Cgb) and a constant phase element (CPEgb). The second consisted of a parallel combination of the resistance (Rg) and a constant phase element (CPEg). Undoubtedly, the existence of a constant phase element (CPE) in these circuit models accounts for the semicircles' observed depression as well as their non-Debye behavior.27The impedance of the CPE contribution was computed using the type of empirical function described below:

In the Nyquist notation, the exponentialαdetermines the angle of phase (β),β= (1 −α)π/2, between theZ′ axis and the radius of the semicircle, while the proportional factor (Q) indicates the value of the capacitance of the CPE element. The parameter values obtained from the equivalent circuit utilized in the electrical response are grouped inTable 3. It is clear that as the temperature was increased, the compound's grain and grain border resistance values decreased, indicating that our sample behaved like a semiconductor.53,54Furthermore, the low alpha values confirmed the significant interaction between the dipoles in this material.55,56

AC conductivity (σac) is a fundamental property that reflects the electrical dynamics of a sample, including its conductivity, capacitance, and the loss factor, while helping classify the conduction mechanism. It is determined from complex impedance measurements using the following formula:

The AC conductivity variation for [(C9H8N)2(InCl6)·2(H2O)] across several fixed temperatures is presented inFig. 12(a). This data indicate that the AC conductivity was nearly constant at lower frequencies but showed dispersion at higher frequencies, typical ofωs. The observed lowσacconductivity values, around 10−6Ω−1cm−1, confirmed its proton-conduction properties.57,58At lower frequencies (10−1<ω< 5 × 103), the electrical current enabled the charge carriers to move over greater distances, which indicated direct current conductivity (σdc).59,60As a result, the principal motions of the charge carriers decreased with increasing frequency.61As the frequency increased (ω> 5 × 103), the leaping frequency of the charge carriers is improved, resulting in an accelerated conduction pathway and enhanced conductivity of the sample. On top of that, this feature denotes a thermally activated process beginning by a boost in the energy levels of the charge transports, which was dominated by the motion of the H+protons due to breaking of the O–H⋯Cl, C–H⋯Cl and O–H⋯N bonds in the structure of the investigated material. The Jonscher's power law62is commonly employed to analyze the phenomenon of conductivity dispersion, and is expressed as:σac(ω) =σdc+Aωs,whereσdcis the direct current conductivity,Ais a constant regulating the strength of the polarizability,ω= 2πfis the angular frequency, ands(≤1) denotes the degree of contact between mobile ions and the enclosing crystalline structure.



To better understand the primary AC conduction mechanism of the material, we investigated the temperature dependence of the exponents, as shown inFig. 12(b). It could be noticed that the values ofsshowed an inverse variation with temperature. The observed decrease insvalues at higher temperatures suggests that the correlated barrier hopping (CBH) model could effectively describe the charge transport mechanism in this region, involving the hopping of charge carriers across potential barriers.63

Additionally, the fitted data of DC conductivity are shown inFig. 12(c), and the dependence is represented by the Arrhenius equation:σ(T) =Aexp(−Ea/kBT),whereArepresents the pre-exponential factor,kBis the Boltzmann constant andEais the thermal activation energy for ion migration. From the plotted graph, we can deduce that the dc conductivity curve boosted with increasing the temperature. Linear fitting the data yielded an activation energy value of 0.53 eV across the temperature range of 313–343 K. This observation indicates that a thermally triggered hopping process governed the conduction mechanism.

In the CBH model, theSexponent was evaluated using the following equation:

The linear fit ofSas a function of temperature can be used to determine the value of the potential barrierWM, as mentioned inFig. 12(b). We discovered thatWM= 65 meV, which was less than 25% of the activation energy (0.53 eV), demonstrating that a single polaron mediated this CBH model. The expression for AC conductivity for the single polaron correlated barrier jump model is as follows:whereε0is the vacuum permittivity,ε′ is the dielectric constant of the material,NTis the number of state densities andUeffis the effective potential energy. Our choice of conduction mechanism is supported byFig. 12(d), which shows there was good agreement between the experimental and computed data ofσac(Table 4).

Furthermore, it can be inferred that the conductivity of our compound (10−6Ω−1cm−1) was higher than that of the [C4H12N]2InCl5hybrid compound (10−7Ω−1cm−1).64This difference could be attributed to structural variations between the two materials.

Analysis of electrical properties relies on a complex modulus formalism, which is well-suited for emphasizing the bulk response of the crystal sample and for uncovering phenomena such as electrode polarization and conductivity relaxation times.65

The calculation of the electric modulus (M*) follows the below equation:M* = jωC0Z* =M′ + jM′′,whereM′ andM′′ are the real and imaginary parts of the modulus, respectively, andC0represents the vacuum capacitance.

The curve of the imaginary portionM′′ exhibited a distinctive asymmetric peak at all temperature points, revealing important characteristics about ion mobility, as presented inFig. 13. As the temperature increased, these peaks were notably shifted toward higher frequencies, which serves as a clear indicator of the intricate association between the movements of the mobile charges carriers within the studied material.66–68In addition, we can infer that this phenomenon was simulated by heat. The observed asymmetry in peak broadening was particularly significant, as it indicated a diverse distribution of relaxation times, each associated with different time constants. The frequency at which the modulus reached its maximum valueatωmaxconsistently shifted toward higher frequencies as the temperature rose, suggesting a hopping mechanism. This indicates that the imaginary part of the dielectric modulus was thermally activated. After the maximum frequency, theM′′(ω) values dropped with increasing frequency. In this plot, the existence of two relaxation domains could be discerned. The low-frequency region (ω< 103rad s−1) suggests that the charge carriers had the capability to traverse extended distances from one site to another through the material. Conversely, the peaks appearing in the high-frequency domain (103<ω< 106rad s−1) indicate that the charge transfers were confined within their potential wells, limiting their movement.



The overall nature and behavior of the modulus spectrum provides compelling evidence for the existence of a hopping mechanism, which plays a fundamental role in facilitating electrical conduction within the material's structure. The asymmetrical peaks inM′′ revealed a non-Debye behavior. The Kohlrausch–Williams–Watts (KWW) equation is used to examine the asymmetric pattern of the peaks in the imaginary part of the electric modulus:69

The peak frequency (ωmax), which corresponds to the alteration between long-range and short-range ionic mobility, allows us to determine the relaxation time (τm). This critical transition is governed by the relationshipωm×τm= 1, withτmdenoting the ions' most probable relaxation time. From the fitted data of the dielectric modulus, we could extract the variation in ln(τ) as a function of 1000/T. This behavior followed the Arrhenius model and its associated activation energies, as shown inFig. 14. From the slope of ln(τ)versus1000/T, the activation energy was determined to be 0.49 eV, which coincides with the value derived from the slope analysis of ln(σdc)versus1000/T. This observation verified that the conduction mechanism was manifested by hopping transport.63



A dielectric material's polarizability is characterized by its relative permittivity (εr) or dielectric constant (ε*), typically expressed as a complex value by the following equation:70ε*(ω) =ε′(ω) − iε′′(ω)

The real component (ε′) quantifies the material capacity to store electrical energy, reflecting the alignment of dipoles within the dielectric. In contrast, the imaginary component (ε′′) represents energy dissipation due to frictional forces, which hinder charge displacements from staying in phase with the field variations.

Fig. 15shows the frequency-dependences of the dielectric constant (ε′) at different temperatures. Two distinct regions could be observed in this variation. First, in the low-frequency region (ω< 103rad s−1), the material showed notably higher (ε′) values surpassing 109at 353 K, signifying their potential as efficient candidate for low-frequency energy storage.71Compared to other organo–inorganic hybrid compounds, like [C2H5NH3]2CoCl4(≈2 105), [C2H5NH3]2ZnBr4(≈4 106)51,72and [(C6H5N2)2ZnCl4] (103–106), the static permittivity of [(C9H8N)2(InCl6)·2(H2O)] was much higher. This could be attributed to the difference in the polarizability of the metal ions and the intermolecular interactions. These permittivity values have a significant impact on applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices, as high static permittivity can help improve the energy-conversion efficiency and the quality of light emission. Hybrid haloperovskites are widely used in these fields due to their exceptional optoelectronic properties. Second, as the frequency increased (ω> 103rad s−1), theε′ motions showed a gradual decrease from 109to 102at 106rad s−1, which enhances the material's overall energy-storage efficiency.73Furthermore, under fixed frequency, the dielectric constant increased with temperature, reflecting the thermal activation of charge carriers, which plays a crucial role in driving polarization mechanisms. These polarization phenomena fall into four key categories: ionic, electronic, orientational, and interfacial. Ionic and electronic polarizations, classified as deformational, result from shifts in the ion and electron positions in response to an electric field. Orientational and interfacial polarizations, categorized as relaxation components, involve the alignment of permanent dipoles and the interaction at the phase or material-electrode boundaries, respectively. These mechanisms collectively influence the material's dielectric behavior, which determines its energy-storage capabilities. The intricate interplay of temperature, frequency, and polarization types shapes the observed dielectric properties. Therefore, at low frequencies, the real part of the dielectric constant is shaped by orientational, interfacial polarizations and space charge effects, validating the non-Debye behavior of the material.74However, in high-frequency scenarios, the electronic and ionic polarizations are more significant, and the electrons do not have sufficient energy for crossing the barriers, leading to lower dielectric constant values. The increase in temperature further enhances the real component of the dielectric constant, driven by thermally activated charge carriers and the behavior of electric dipoles, limiting the ability of electrons to cross barriers and thereby lowering polarization.75



In this work, we synthesized a new indium-based organic–inorganic hybrid compound formulated as [(C9H8N)2(InCl6)·2(H2O)]viaslow evaporation at room temperature. SXRD analysis clarified that the crystal structure belonged to the centrosymmetricP1̄ space group. The consolidation and stabilization of the title compound was ensured through various types of hydrogen bonds. By utilizing infrared spectroscopy at room temperature, we were able to identify and confirm the different vibration modes and the composition of the crystal structure. The ultraviolet spectrum exhibited two absorption peaks at 264 and 365 nm, which were the main characteristics of its optical properties, with energy gaps of 3.96 and 4.74 eV, respectively. In fact, the thermal breakdown of the tested complex took place in three distinct stages, resulting in the decomposition of both the organic and inorganic entities. These stages led to a total mass loss of approximately (92.34%). Hirshfeld surface analysis was implemented to visualize and expound upon the disparities in the molecular surroundings between these two entities. Through the investigation of diverse intermolecular interactions using Hirshfeld surface analysis, it was discovered that the complex exhibited contributions from Cl⋯H/H⋯Cl and H⋯H contacts, which play a crucial role in determining the crystal structure of the new recently developed hybrid complex. The study of the compound's electrical conductivity indicated the semiconducting characteristics of the material. It was further shown that the conductivity response in alternating current aligned with the Jonscher power law at different temperatures. The decrease ofSindicated that the transport mechanism in this material was governed by a correlated barrier hopping mechanism (CBH). The electrical data were evaluated using a modular approach that featured a unique relaxation time distribution and the Havriliak–Negami function. Finally, the material's high dielectric constant (109) in comparison to other compounds suggests its potential for use in non-linear optoelectronic devices.

For Precision Medicine to reach its full potential, a third pillar calledPrecision Deliveryis starting to evolve to complement the existing two pillars ofPrecision DiagnosisandPrecision Therapy. Precision Deliverywill help ensure the right therapy for the right disease will be able to reach the right location at the right time



.

While Precision Health helps to monitor and maintain an individual in a state of health and wellbeing [1], Precision Medicine aims to restore the health of an individual when they enter a state of illness [2] (Figure1). Traditionally, Precision Medicine is thought of as having two pillars:Precision Diagnosis—which characterizes diseases using genetic testing, molecular profiling, and advanced imaging; andPrecision Therapy—which creates personalized treatments based on molecular drivers of a disease, as well as the unique genetic makeup of an individual.



Overview of precision health and precision medicine for delivering personalized medicine.

Precision Health helps to monitor and maintain an individual in a state of health and wellbeing by promoting disease prevention behaviors and detecting disease earlier using health‐monitoring devices and technologies that collect actionable data. If patients become ill, they enter Precision Medicine which encompasses:Precision Diagnosis(which detects, identifies and characterizes the disease process that is making a patient feel ill),Precision Therapy(which identifies the correct therapy to treat specific pathways driving the disease), andPrecision Delivery(which helps ensure the correct therapy reaches target cells contributing to the disease).Precision Deliveryhas three independent modules—targeted delivery, microenvironment modulation, and cellular interactions, all of which need to be considered and optimized to ensure optimal therapy delivery in patients. After treatment, patients are followed up; if the therapy was successful in treating the disease, they re‐enter Precision Health, but if the disease persists or is redetected, they again re‐enter Precision Medicine. Data collected as part of health maintenance, disease monitoring, and subsequent therapeutic interventions for each patient will then be processed using artificial intelligence (AI) models to assess optimal and sub‐optimal responses; this will provide continuous and iterative feedback to help guide both Precision Health and Precision Medicine.

Although new therapies show significant potential in the laboratory when they are “spatially coupled” with target cells in cell culture and/or array testing, a significant proportion ultimately fail to make it through United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) approval, in what is commonly referred to as the “valley of death” [3]. In many cases, this is due to variable and sub‐therapeutic responses during clinical trials, attributed, in large part, to how these therapies are translated and given to patients. Conventionally, this occurs via intravenous (IV) or oral (PO) administration, resulting in their systemic distribution, which when combined with first pass metabolism and/or organ entrapment, results in very little therapy reaching target cells (i.e., they are now “spatially uncoupled” with target cells). One solution is to administer therapies at higher concentrations; however, this is often associated with significant issues including off‐target effects, side‐effects, and unwanted interactions.

To keep therapies at lower concentrations to mitigate these adverse effects, while concurrently ensuring they reach therapeutic levels at a site of interest, delivery strategies can be used to “spatially re‐couple” therapies in vivo with target cells. For certain therapies, simple delivery techniques have already been adopted, as demonstrated by drug inhalation for airway diseases, drug injection into affected joints, and topical cream application for skin disorders. Nevertheless, advances in (bio)engineering, polymer science, imaging, and additive manufacturing have aided in the development of more specialized medical devices and technologies that can now target, and modulate, almost any part of the human body with exquisite precision. Accordingly, we are now seeing an increasing adoption of more complex targeted delivery approaches for a wide range of diseases. In oncology, there has been a significant expansion in the use of locoregional techniques for curative therapy, local disease control, or even to help transition to surgery. One example is intraarterial (IA) therapy to treat liver tumors, with multiple large randomized clinical trials showing that it improves therapy efficacy, reduces side effects, improves quality of life, and importantly, increases survival benefit when compared with systemic IV therapy [4,5]. While promising results have also been seen using IA chemotherapy in other cancers (i.e., melanoma [6], pancreatic [7], urological—kidney and bladder [8], head and neck tumors [9], retinoblastoma [10], cholangiocarcinoma [11]), definitive conclusions still require larger trials. Interestingly, for brain tumors (i.e., glioblastoma), the benefits of IA chemotherapy were initially shown to be limited, especially when examining overall survival compared to conventional IV administration [12]. However, when IA chemotherapy is combined with mannitol, which opens the blood–brain barrier (BBB), data are more encouraging and show improved survival benefits [12]. Hence, it is transpiring that delivery is more complex than initially thought, going beyond just the physical delivery of therapies into organs, but needing to also consider the use of adjunctive drugs and technologies to overcome physiological barriers (i.e., BBB, endothelial–epithelial interfaces, stromal/fibrous tissue causing increased extracellular matrix [ECM]) or employing strategies to avoid local therapy inactivation (i.e., hostile local microenvironments, drug efflux pumps) [13].

Hence, for Precision Medicine to realize its full potential, a third pillar is needed that we propose to call:Precision Delivery, which can be considered as a framework of three interconnected modules: (i)targeted delivery(i.e., direct delivery of therapies to specific sites); (ii)microenvironment modulation(i.e., facilitating movement of therapies through complex tissue matrices and barriers to allow them to reach target cells); and (iii)cellular interactions(i.e., optimizing how therapies interact with target cells to initiate their desired effect(s)) (Figure1).

The goal of targeted delivery is to avoid loss of therapy that can occur following conventional PO administration (i.e., destruction from the high acidity of the stomach or inactivation by the liver following gastrointestinal absorption) or IV administration (i.e., loss of larger therapies, like cells, due to lung entrapment; or loss of smaller therapies, especially micro/nanomedicines, from sequestration by the reticuloendothelial system and kidneys). To overcome these issues, four distinct categories have emerged to directly deliver therapies to target organs: (i)Endovascular approaches: these use imaging to guide catheters into different organs via their blood supply; (ii)Endoluminal approaches: these use fiber optic technologies in the form of endoscopes to visualize, and access, luminal canals/cavities; (iii)Percutaneous approaches: these use imaging to guide needles or minimally invasive technologies through the skin to deeper locations in the body; (iv)Implantation approaches: these use direct application of devices onto the skin, or surgical techniques to create artificial spaces that can accommodate devices in deeper anatomical locations (Figure2).



Main categories for targeted delivery.

One module ofPrecision Deliveryis: Targeted delivery. This describes how different organs in the human body can be accessed and targeted using four main categories: (i) endovascular (i.e., through blood vessels using devices like catheters), (ii) endoluminal (i.e., through organs which have cavities or are hollow using devices like optical scopes), (iii) percutaneous (i.e., through the skin using devices like needles), and (iv) implantation (i.e., through placement of physical structures inside or onto the human body) approaches.

Over the years, the technologies within these categories have developed increasing levels of sophistication to not only enable organs to be targeted with increasing precision [14,15], but also enable delivery of advanced therapeutics. For endovascular approaches, several core technologies have served as platforms for the development of new medical devices. For example: (i) balloons have evolved to have flanges that can cut through fibrous scar tissue (cutting balloons), transferable therapy coatings (drug eluting balloons), or contain technologies that can deposit energy (radiofrequency ablation [RFA] balloons); (ii) stents have evolved to contain occlusive fabrics (stent grafts), redirect blood flow (flow diverting stents), deliver therapies in a controlled manner over time (drug eluting stents), or dissolve over time (biodegradable stents); (iii) injectable materials have evolved to act as vehicles for controlled therapy release (drug eluting spheres/particles), physical occlusion (detachable coils and vascular plugs), or have fine‐tuned polymerization characteristics for controlled embolization (glue and onyx); and (iv) devices can now be placed inside vessels to remove blood clots (thrombectomy devices), replace defective structures (transcatheter valve replacement), deliver energies for tissue destruction (laser, cryoablation, and RFA catheters), or bypass barriers for therapy delivery (new emerging microneedle balloon catheters that can penetrate the vessel wall). Interestingly, positive‐feedback loops then organically develop between different technological advances and novel therapies. For example, the development of high‐resolution imaging equipment and small diameter catheters, that even have steerable tips, have allowed for super‐selective access to almost any location in the human body. Accordingly, this catalyzed the development of highly potent catheter‐based therapies (i.e., Yttrium‐90 radiation spheres for tumor treatment), which could only be created once delivery to very specific locations could be ensured, given the potential of these therapies to induce serious adverse effects if delivered to non‐target locations [16].

Similar technological advances can also be seen with endoscopes (which have evolved into powerful luminal delivery tools given their improved flexibility and light sources, coupled with their ability to incorporate therapeutic channels for drug and device delivery), as well as needles (which have evolved from a basic sampling tool, to a high‐tech instrument that can deliver therapies either directly into tissues via hollow‐bores, or deposit thermal energy into tissues via solid bores that can be used as a probe or antenna). Biotechnological advances have also been instrumental in creating implantable delivery technologies that can be placed superficially (i.e., microneedle patches for transdermal delivery of therapies like DNA vaccines [17], insulin [18], or drugs [19]), underneath the skin within the subcutaneous or intramuscular space (i.e., bioscaffolds that can accommodate cellular therapies that function as an “artificial organ” [20,21]), or deep inside the body (i.e., bioabsorbable meshes that can provide strength to tissues, while also releasing bioactive compounds to promote tissue regeneration [22]).

Following delivery, therapies need to overcome several tissue barriers to reach target cells, starting with cellular interfaces (i.e., endothelial cells for those delivered in the blood stream and epithelial cells for those delivered into biological lumens) to tissue matrices that consist of the ECM (composed of collagen and glycoproteins) and interstitial space (IS; regulated by the lymphatic system). Appreciation of these barriers is essential, as select organs have specialized barriers (i.e., brain with the BBB, kidney with glomeruli, and fetus with the placenta) and diseases can often alter barrier function (i.e., some tumors have increased stroma, ECM and high interstitial pressures that limit therapy access, while other inflammatory diseases have dysfunctional/leaky barriers making therapy retention difficult) [23,24,25].

For decades, we have known that modulating tissue microenvironments can affect these barriers to help therapy delivery; initial strategies included manipulating local physiological parameters (i.e., pH, osmolarity, temperature, and oxygenation) or using specific drugs/antibodies to change tissue receptors to sensitize tissues. However, these approaches have challenges in being able to localize these effects at specific anatomical locations. Accordingly, this led to the development of innovative technologies that can now spatially and temporally modulate tissue microenvironments. This is best illustrated for BBB opening where hyperosmolar agents, like mannitol, were initially used but given they affected the entire BBB, they were associated with side effects, such as headaches, in addition to exposing the whole brain to circulating pathogens and toxic materials [26,27]. Several technologies were then developed to open the BBB at specific locations, with focused ultrasound (FUS) emerging as a leading approach given it can temporarily and noninvasively open the BBB at both superficial and deep locations, especially with the concomitant use of microbubbles [28,29]. Clinical trials are now underway testing FUS for BBB opening to augment therapy delivery to tumors and neurodegenerative disorders [30].

In other tissues, innovative technologies like iontophoresis are being explored, which uses low‐voltage continuous electrical currents to change the charge or polarity of tissues to facilitate therapy delivery. Initially this was used to promote transdermal delivery of drugs [31], with newer indications including enhancing chemotherapy delivery into solid tumors that have penetration challenges [32]. Electroporation is another microenvironment modulating technology, which uses high voltage pulsed electrical fields that can transiently destabilize cell membranes allowing the entry of macromolecules, nucleic acids, and gene therapies into cells. While this technology is readily used in vitro and ex vivo (i.e., engineering chimeric antigen receptor‐T cells) [33], its is in vivo use has been more challenging, but is being explored as part of electrochemotherapy, gene electrotransfer, and electrovaccines, especially in superficial tissues [34,35].

Once therapies reach target cells, they interact either via: (i) membrane receptors (i.e., via receptor channel opening, G‐protein mediated interactions, transmembrane receptor signaling, or nuclear receptor signaling) or (ii) intracellular targets (i.e., via internalization through endocytosis, micropinocytosis, phagocytosis, or fusion; or via cargo transfer into cells through gap junctions or nanotubes), especially for therapies that modulate gene transcription or translation [36,37,38,39].

While microenvironment modulation technologies help promote passive targeting of therapies by facilitating their transit across tissue barriers, other technologies can help promote more active targeting of therapies by facilitating cellular interactions. These include: (i) increasing therapy bioavailability (i.e., via PEGylation—the process of covalently attaching polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer chains to a molecule to enhance its solubility, stability, circulation time, and biocompatibility); (ii) augmenting therapy targeting, binding, internalization, or ability to transfer cargo, either directly (i.e., using priming techniques) [40,41] or indirectly (i.e., by functionalizing using ligands, uni‐ or bi‐specific monoclonal antibodies, cell penetrating peptides) [42,43,44]; and (iii) creating specialized carrier‐platforms that can protect therapies from premature inactivation or degradation by the tissue microenvironment (i.e., nanocarriers, viral, and nonviral vectors) [13,45]. Newer technologies include creating stimuli‐responsive platforms that can release therapies on local environmental (i.e., tissue hypoxia) or external (i.e., using energy carried within the waves or beams of conventional imaging modalities) cues, for spatial and/or temporal control of therapy delivery [46].

When considering non‐invasive therapies (i.e., thermal, light and radiation therapies), their ability to accurately target, and hence interact with cells, relies heavily on imaging guidance. In addition, the tissues and microenvironments that these therapies need to travel through to reach target cells must be carefully considered, given they can potentially interact, attenuate, or even modify, the therapy. This is best illustrated with stereotactic radiotherapy (i.e., Gamma Knife system), which can deliver radiation therapy in the form of gamma‐rays with 1 mm accuracy using three‐dimensional imaging, but whose delivery must be carefully planned to not damage non‐target cells within the beam path, while concurrently ensuring the beam has enough therapeutic energy to be effective.

When considering existing therapies, new therapies (i.e., gene, cell, cell‐free and immune based therapies), and emerging technologies (i.e., thermal, light, radiation, and electromagnetic field therapies), each of thePrecision Deliverymodules can be independently considered, optimized, and ultimately combined, to ensure more effective translation from the benchtop to the patient's bedside. Over the years, many studies have clearly shown the benefit of employing at least one module ofPrecision Deliveryin different disease states. The use of twoPrecision Deliverymodules has been less studied, but small clinical studies are starting to emerge showing its benefit—for example, FUS has been used to transiently open the BBB (Module 2) to improve access into the brain of a systemically administered specific antiamyloid monoclonal antibody therapy (aducanumab; Module 3), with evidence showing this approach results in a greater reduction in cerebral amyloid‐beta (Aβ) load in patients with Alzheimer's disease [47]. In another study, targeted IA delivery (Module 1) of a chemotherapy (teniposide) following BBB opening using mannitol (Module 2) was shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of malignant glioma [48]. However, while several preclinical studies clearly demonstrate improved outcomes when using all threePrecision Deliverymodules, clinical studies are currently limited. Of those that exist, the studies are usually based on an extension of an already approved treatment strategy that involves twoPrecision Deliverymodules. For example, hepatocellular carcinoma can be effectively treated using transarterial radioembolization (TARE), which uses endovascular techniques (Module 1) to deliver Yttrium‐90 glass beads that accumulate next to cancer cells, blocking their blood supply while also locally delivering high doses of lethal radiation (Module 3). In a recent study, the use of microbubbles that are locally destroyed using ultrasound to prime the tumor microenvironment (Module 2) prior to TARE was shown to be feasible, safe, and have improved patient responses [49]. Hence, if barriers are encountered that prevent the clinical evaluation of an optimized approach that uses all threePrecision Deliverymodules, then a step‐wise approach that builds upon existing foundations that already employ one, or even two,Precision Deliverymodule(s) is recommended (Figure3).



Interactions of the different modules ofPrecision Delivery.

Precision Deliveryconsists of three main modules: (i) targeted delivery (delivering therapies directly to specific target locations), (ii) microenvironment modulation (modulating target tissues to make them more responsive to therapies), and (iii) cellular interactions (optimizing therapies to facilitate their interactions with target cells). While each of these modules are independent and can thus be selectively optimized, they can also be combined (i.e., the concurrent use of two or even all threePrecision Deliverymodules) to create synergistic effects to further enhance the effect(s) ofPrecision Delivery.

As target organs move from superficial to deep locations in the body, imaging plays a central role in guiding both targeted delivery and microenvironment modulation technologies. For example, fluoroscopy and ultrasound are commonly used to guide the placement of medical devices (i.e., needles and catheters) in real‐time, while cross‐sectional imaging, like computerized tomorgraphy (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is the cornerstone for stereotactic guidance of noninvasive technologies (i.e., radiotherapy). Visualizing this information has also evolved from using physical workstations to extended reality technologies (i.e., virtual [VR], augmented [AR], and mixed [MR] reality) that can facilitate real‐time visualization of medical images and information onto patients, which, in turn, will increase the precision of tissue targeting while concurrently reducing procedural time, potential complications, as well as improving operator ergonomics [50]. Furthermore, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) can now extract, segment, and process data within these medical images to identify areas for treatment, as well as create virtual GPS‐like navigation maps that operators can follow to guide devices to specific locations within the body with high accuracy. In addition, advanced predictive simulation modeling (akin to the digital twin concept [51]) can be used to test differentPrecision Deliverystrategies. This will be based on (i) patient data, which include imaging that defines the anatomy of a patient, disease location, and disease burden, as well as biodata detailing their physiological status, comorbidities, and even their disease molecular profile; and (ii) available outcome data (i.e., feasibility, efficacy, safety, risk profile) from different approaches or treatment strategies, which will be collected from publications, publicly available databases, or available through electronic medical records that can be efficiently audited through natural language processing techniques [52]. AI algorithms can then integrate this information to create, and select, an optimal delivery strategy tailored to each individual, thereby ensuring the best possible outcome with the lowest risk profile, and hence potential complication rate [53]. Over time, machine learning models will then offer up‐to‐date optimized recommendations based on the latest procedural insights, technological advancements, and overall outcomes that are reported into the model from different centers and industry partners. Furthermore, given the processing power and speed of these AI algorithms, live intraoperative feedback will be possible to help provide instantaneous guidance to the operator, especially through the extended reality space, to ensure optimal delivery approaches are executed. Another growing area of therapy delivery is device tracking, which uses the integration of real‐time sensors into devices that can then provide feedback of surrounding tissue structures (i.e., tissue resistances and even molecular data), as well as positioning within 3D space, thereby determining their exact location within the human body [54,55]. Given the expansive capacity of AI to process and analyze these large volumes of sensor data, it has also spearheaded transformative advances in medical robotic systems [56,57,58].

Our ability to understand how the body responds to therapies is conventionally done by measuring physiological indices, blood markers, or by detecting anatomical changes on conventional imaging; however, these assessments are performed after therapy administration. To enable earlier assessments, newerPrecision Healthmonitoring devices (i.e., continuous glucose monitors [CGM]) or molecular/functional imaging approaches (i.e., nuclear medicine imaging) are being integrated into patient follow‐up algorithms. Nevertheless, there are still significant data missing from the point‐of‐therapy‐delivery to the point‐of‐effect, and without this knowledge, it becomes increasingly difficult to understand exactly how the modules ofPrecision Deliveryare working and, hence, how they could be further optimized. Hence, several noninvasive in vivo imaging technologies are currently in development, aimed at assessing either the therapy itself (i.e., its viability, biodistribution, activation, and even integration into the target cell), which often requires ex vivo labeling or modification of the therapy, and/or the effect of therapies on target tissues. In the latter case, there has been considerable success in imaging techniques (i.e., with PET and SPECT imaging) using functionalized imaging agents directed at target receptors that are sufficiently upregulated for imaging agents to localize to, and thus generate a detectable signal. However, when these target receptors are limited, or the process being detected is subtle, systemic delivery of imaging agents can encounter similar issues to therapies, ultimately resulting in them not being able to produce enough signal‐to‐noise ratio that can be reliably detected for image generation; in these instances, employingPrecision Deliveryapproaches for these imaging agents may have significant benefit. Furthermore, such approaches will be critically important when considering theragnostic agents, especially for radionuclides (i.e., alpha‐emitting nuclides) that could have deleterious off‐target effects if not specifically localized to target tissues [59,60]. Finally, the timing of implementing differentPrecision Deliverymodules needs to be considered; for example, real‐time feedback of biological effects or expression of relevant targets following tissue priming after microenvironment modulation will be critical to guide the optimal time to undertake targeted delivery, or even predict therapy responses that could then help guide potential additional modulation steps to further improve therapy outcome [61].

While the modules ofPrecision Deliveryprovide a broad framework to create delivery approaches, patient specific variables should also be considered to create more “personalized” delivery approaches. Hence, in addition to therapy considerations for each patient (i.e., pharmacogenomics, pharmacokinetics and pharmacometabolomics), delivery considerations include: (i) anatomic variations that may preclude, or increase the risk of, certain interventions or technologies; (ii) age‐related changes that can make targeted delivery approaches more challenging (i.e., endovascular delivery: endothelial diseases like atherosclerosis can potentially impact delivery across the vessel wall; endoluminal delivery: the microbiome can modify drug efficacy) [62,63]; (iii) health and mobility considerations (i.e., specific body positioning, claustrophobia, contrast allergies) that can affect the ability of patients to undertake some procedures, especially if prolonged; (iv) pediatric versus adult patients—delivery can be more challenging in children given their smaller size and the understanding that most children will need general anesthesia, with some studies now showing this may have potential neurodevelopment risks [64].

Implementation of new technologies often invite challenges due to initial lack of defined standard operating procedures. This disparity can generate reproducibility issues across various sites that then impedes the widespread embracing of such technologies. However, with time and experience, optimized parameters and protocols become established, and as this knowledge is shared through vendors, conferences, publications, or collaborations, it enables more consistent outcomes, which, in turn, promotes wider acceptance and implementation of any new technology. One example to illustrate this point is the use of MRI; initially access to this technology was constrained to a few large centers; however, as this technology became more affordable and imaging protocols became standardized, MRI gradually found its place into more centers and more widely integrated into patient care pathways. Similar implementation flows are to be expected when considering howPrecision Deliveryapproaches can be more widely adopted, especially in smaller centers (see “hub‐and‐spoke” model in Section3.3.1).

For technology applications that have a threshold level effect (i.e., tissue destruction that consistently occurs once a certain amount of energy is deposited), issues with clinical standardization are less evident. However, for effects that occur over a range of input energies (i.e., bioeffects from microenvironment modulation technologies), standardizing approaches becomes challenging, especially when vendors of the same technology use different terminologies, or do not display the exact parameters that are employed. Furthermore, many of these technologies are often preclinically tested by multiple groups using different, and often randomly chosen, parameters; this leads to a complex landscape in which specific bioeffects are reported to occur across large parameter ranges. Hence, to ensure new applications for these novel technologies can be effectively clinically translated, regulatory bodies, societies, and/or foundations are often needed to help create, and implement, standardized protocols. One example is the FUS foundation, which not only provides resources and information for US FDA approved ablative FUS, but has also helped create a central repository to highlight the multiple expanding biomechanical effects of nonablative FUS (i.e., increasing endothelial and ECM barrier permeability, upregulating tissue antigens, cytokines, chemokines and receptors, neuromodulation, etc.) and where they stand in their translational pathway (i.e., preclinical, pilot trials, pivotal trials, US FDA approval, reimbursement) [65]. Through such communities, clinicians, researchers, and industry leaders have been able to come together to create “white papers” to help standardize protocols, as well as access funds for new research and clinical trials to keep pushing forward this technology into new domains.

A final consideration applicable for both targeted delivery and microenvironment modulation is their frequency of implementation. In some circumstances, the repetitive use of certainPrecision Deliveryapproaches may be prohibitory (i.e., the need for repetitive sedations/anesthesia or access site risks); under these situations, creative solutions and protocols should be considered, such as usingPrecision Deliveryfor therapy initiation or rescue (i.e., sub‐optimal or declining responses), with systemic administration then used for maintenance dosing.

Delivery strategies can be influenced by understanding both the target and mechanism of action of therapies. For example, when treating a diseased segment of bowel, this could be approached from the endoluminal side (via endoscopy) for therapies that preferentially target epithelial cells [66], or from the endovascular side (via the mesenteric circulation) for therapies that preferentially target endothelial cells [14]. The route of administration is also important to consider for certain therapy derivatives; for example, prednisone (a prodrug that the liver converts to its active form, prednisolone) is typically only administered orally in liquid or tablet form, whereas prednisolone (or closely related compounds like methylprednisolone) is given parenterally. Finally, therapy formulations are important to consider based on their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination from different administration routes; for example, lidocaine can be given in sterile isotonic solution (for IV injection), mixed with oils or waxes to produce a semi‐solid cream (for topical applications), incorporated into temperature sensitive adhesive matrices (for transdermal patches), and even suspended in a liquid (for spray applications). Furthermore, new innovative ways are being developed to deliver lidocaine, including incorporating it into liposomes, microneedle array patches, or in ultrasound responsive platforms (i.e., microbubbles or microcapsules made of poly(lactic‐co‐glycolic acid, which is a biodegradable and biocompatible copolymer).

The past decade has also seen significant advances in biological therapies and these need to be carefully considered when using such therapies compared with conventional drug or small molecule therapies, which are highly standardized, reproducibly manufactured, and can be stored and reconstituted in ways which have almost no impact on the therapy. In contrast, cells are living and hence are very sensitive to environmental cues and handling, which can significantly affect their viability, functionality, and overall therapeutic efficacy. This becomes important when cells are given using targeted delivery devices, which can subject them to increased pressures and sheer forces, causing them to become inadvertently activated, or even deactivated/damaged. However, several technologies are in development to mitigate these effects [67], with examples including pressure sensing‐closed loop infusion systems and flow filters to promote laminar flow dynamics during infusions.

In general, specific operator skills are required to perform targeted delivery techniques, while access to specialized and expensive equipment is often required for microenvironment modulation approaches; both of which are readily available through interventional and surgical specialties in larger hospitals and academic centers. However, in smaller community hospitals, especially in low‐resource areas, implementingPrecision Deliveryapproaches can be challenging due to limited infrastructure and technical experience, as well as cost constraints. To address this, a “hub‐and‐spoke” model has proven successful in many other areas of medicine [68], which when applied toPrecision Delivery, could mean that more advanced technologies and expertise will be concentrated in the central hubs, while the spokes would focus more on patient work up and follow‐up with transfer into the hubs for streamlined therapy delivery. For some patients who may not be able to travel to hubs due to physical, family, or financial constraints, more advanced care coordination will likely be required, including offering select, or scaled down,Precision Deliverymodules based on available resources to ensure that patients at these spoke locations receive some benefit compared with conventional delivery approaches (Figure4). Furthermore, for this framework to work, accessibility toPrecision Deliverymodules at the hubs will have to accommodate an increased throughflow; in principle, this can be accomplished by educating and training nonprocedural physicians, and even nonphysician medical providers (i.e., physician assistants), to perform the smaller and lower risk delivery procedures, with more technically challenging procedures that use complex technologies triaged to those with more subspecialized skillsets. However, the overall implementation of such models is always associated with challenges in private health care systems, where insurance coverage may dictate whether a patient can access a hub or receive coverage for an optimizedPrecision Deliveryapproach.



Hub and spoke model forPrecision Delivery.

One potential model to ensure the widespread adoption ofPrecision Deliveryin different healthcare systems is to adopt a “hub‐and‐spoke” approach. Here, all modules ofPrecision Deliverycan be implemented in academic and larger centers (i.e., the hub), which have sub‐specialty expertise as well as access to specialized infrastructure and expensive equipment. In contrast, smaller centers (i.e., the spokes), will either be able to refer patients into the hubs forPrecision Deliveryapproaches, or offer some adaptation of an optimizedPrecision Deliveryapproach for patients based on their available resources—this can include offering one or even twoPrecision Deliverymodules, scaled downPrecision Deliverymodules, or even just working up patients before, and following them after, their transfer into the hubs whey they can receive a fully optimized and individualizedPrecision Deliveryapproach. For such a model to work, the overarching governance structure relies on extensive collaborations, excellent communication between healthcare providers, seamless sharing of protected healthcare information, and a robust transfer‐infrastructure into and out of the hub, to ensure patients can all benefit fromPrecision Deliveryapproaches, regardless of their location or direct access to specific centers.

For new therapies,Precision Deliverystrategies can be prospectively integrated into new clinical trial workflows for subsequent evaluation and approval. In contrast, the use of such strategies for established therapies can come with challenges, especially as their approval will have been granted on prior clinical trial outcomes, in which dosing and pharmacokinetics will have been assessed following systemic administration, thereby potentially making these datasets not applicable for targeted delivery approaches. In these circumstances, the ability to integrate emerging technologies andPrecision Deliverystrategies into established delivery workflows and protocols needs to be done with care to ensure: (i) the new delivery approach falls within acceptable standards of patient care; (ii) patients and clinical teams understand the additional benefit these new approaches offer relative to their risk profile; (iii) therapies are compatible with the new technology; and (iv) any proposed targeted delivery route is approved within the instructions for use for a therapy. If these criteria are not met, consultation and guidance from the therapy and technology companies will be needed, followed by local Institutional Review Board approval to conduct an investigational study to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the delivery approach with the chosen therapy, especially since potential dose reduction strategies should be considered to mitigate adverse effects arising from high local concentrations of a therapy.

ForPrecision Deliverystrategies adapted from existing techniques that are currently used in clinical practice, the benefits and risks can be easily explained and contextualized for informed patient consent. (That is, lumbar puncture has traditionally been used as a safe and easily performed procedure for cerebrospinal fluid sampling, but recently it is now being used as an access route for targeted therapy delivery into the central nervous system—one example is spinraza/nusinersen for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy). However, for more invasive approaches that use novel techniques or technologies that have a higher risk profile, it will be important to clearly explain this to patients to ensure they are fully informed. In situations where patients do not feel comfortable with an approach, specificPrecision Deliverymodules may be able to be either removed or substituted based on supporting evidence and within the limitations set by any clinical trial. Furthermore, technologies that rely on extensive data input and collection have the potential to introduce new risks to patient privacy, especially when these datasets are shared to improve either the technology itself or drivePrecision DeliveryAI algorithms. Hence, appropriate measures and safeguards need to be set in place from the outset, including using de‐identified data, employing data security protocols, being compliant with HIPPA guidelines, as well as being transparent to patients about how their data will be used to ensure they can provide their informed consent and maintain their trust with the healthcare provider.

ForPrecision Deliveryto reach its full potential, thoughtful preclinical testing needs to be undertaken in clinically appropriate translational models that not only have a similar anatomy to humans but also exhibit diseases that share the same molecular pathways observed in patients. These studies should also focus on generating scientific evidence to support an optimal approach for clinical translation, demonstrating the benefits that eachPrecision Deliverymodule has in isolation, as well as the synergistic effects when they are combined. Close collaboration and early engagement with regulatory bodies (such as the US FDA) is strongly recommended to ensure that the correct and appropriate datasets are collected to support an optimized delivery approach, thus facilitating a more streamlined translation into clinical trials. In late‐stage preclinical testing in larger animal models, the equipment used should be as close as possible to versions that will be clinically translated to allow for iterative feedback on the setup, protocols (i.e., settings and algorithms), and use (i.e., interactions with the user and patient) before testing in human patients. Furthermore, given some devices are driven by complex and sophisticated engineering technologies, it will be important for them to have simplified interfaces, moving away from multiple dials and knobs, to one‐touch preprogrammed buttons that can execute an automated protocol; this will enable more widespread use of technologies across different centers and operators, while concurrently reducing the risk for any intraprocedural errors. The algorithms used to create these protocols will be based on preclinical datasets and will work by dynamically adjusting intraprocedural parameters to ensure the optimal delivery of therapies, while operating within a predefined safe range to minimize potential harm/adverse effects.

Despite the insights and technological advances contributing to eachPrecision Deliverymodule, majority of clinical data are from small single‐center early phase (i.e., I and II) studies; while these often show good safety and efficacy data supporting various delivery approaches, there is still a lack of robust long‐term data (especially survival data for cancer studies) from larger prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter phase III clinical trials, that directly compare these novel delivery approaches with conventional systemic delivery. This is further complicated by the fact that many of these approaches also employ concomitant conventional or newer targeted (i.e., immunotherapies in oncology) therapies in the background; as such, it is often hard to match patients with similar disease burden and molecular characteristics. In addition, care must be taken when drawing conclusions from studies in which microenvironment modulation was essential for a therapy to reach target cells but which was not performed, irrespective of the delivery approach. Furthermore, given that more than one module will likely be needed to fully realizePrecision Deliveryfor many diseases, either robust preclinical data will need to be generated to validate an optimized delivery approach, or eachPrecision Deliverymodule will need to be assessed in double/triple‐intervention trials, such that they can be evaluated as an independent variable in isolation, or in combination, relative to a conventional treatment arm. Given the complexity of undertaking such trials, consortiums will likely need to be formed across multiple centers to facilitate protocol standardization, patient recruitment, as well as broader population sampling to ensure reduce any bias in the data. To address concerns related to these exploratory trials not adequately informing clinical practice or policy decisions in the real‐world, given they are usually optimized to determine efficacy, pragmatic trials should also be considered to assess how complex interventions, consisting of several interacting components, can be assessed for meaningful outcomes relative to acceptable standards of care [69].

New and exciting areas for therapy delivery include the fetus, children/pediatrics, and the lymphatic system; all of which have seen recent significant developments in delivery approaches due to technological advancements in both imaging (that can be used for interventional guidance) and equipment. Other exciting developments include delivery of neuromodulatory implantable chips (i.e., Nerualink) that act as tissue‐computer interfaces to detect and process neuronal action potentials to wirelessly control external devices. Wearable devices are also set to play a key role in understanding and assessing the effectiveness of therapies by monitoring their responses followingPrecision Deliveryapproaches (i.e., using a CGM to assess the function of transplanted islets following their endovascular delivery into the liver) or even help guide treatment timing based on physiological or molecular changes that can be detected with these devices. Finally,Precision Deliverysolutions are increasingly being appreciated to be essential for emerging exciting therapies such as: (i) CRISPR–Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats‐associated protein 9), which is a powerful gene editing technology that can modify DNA at specific locations to insert, delete, or alter the DNA sequence to modify and correct abnormal genes with the hope of curing certain diseases, but which have encountered poor editing efficiency, off‐target effects, and immunogenicity issues when translated into humans; and (ii) nanotechnologies that have shown significant preclinical potential, with theranostic, stimuli‐responsive, microenvironment modulating, and multimodal nanoprobes [70], but which have also not been easily translated into patients due to biodistribution issues (i.e., predominant uptake in the reticuloendothelial system following systemic administration) and off‐target toxicity issues.

Although systemic administration of some therapies may be appropriate, this delivery choice should not be the default route, nor the one used based solely on convenience. Instead, therapy delivery should be considered in the organized framework ofPrecision Deliveryto ensure the correct module(s) is(are) used and optimized for each individual patient. As AI integrates intoPrecision Delivery, to process the outcome and safety data from the different modules relative to each patient and disease state, it will catalyze the development of predictive models to help physicians choose the most appropriate patient‐specific delivery approach for a certain therapy, as well as catalyze innovation to create solutions to address new unmet delivery needs or existing shortcomings. Hence, integratingPrecision Deliveryinto Precision Medicine in the coming decade has the potential to ensure that each patient will be able to get the right therapy, at the right place, at the right time.

Pain‐related conditions are the leading cause of years lived with disability globally. Managing pain presents significant challenges, including the need to address multiple biopsychosocial factors and the difficulty in delivering evidence‐based treatments. Digital health technologies, such as conversational agents, offer the potential for personalised and accessible pain management. However, the characteristics and effectiveness of these interventions are not yet fully understood. This scoping review aims to comprehensively evaluate the applications and effectiveness of conversational agents in supporting pain management in adults (i.e., healthy individuals at risk of developing pain, individuals currently experiencing pain and healthcare providers or students involved in managing pain conditions).

Searches were systematically conducted across six databases—MEDLINE PubMed, ACM Digital Library, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane CENTRAL—and five trial registries from inception.

Twenty‐eight studies were included, focusing on capturing health information (n= 8), providing emotional support (n= 7), facilitating adherence to self‐management exercises (n= 6), delivering psychological treatment (n= 5), offering organisational support (n= 1) and educating healthcare providers (n= 1). These studies addressed conditions with pain as a central or common symptom, including dementia (n= 7), cancer (n= 5) and musculoskeletal disorders (n= 4), among others. None of the conversational agents on the market covered all four stages recommended for translational research (development, feasibility, effectiveness and implementation).

The use of conversational agents in pain management is relatively new and involves diverse and promising appllications. However, evidence supporting their effectiveness in improving pain‐related outcomes remains limited and heterogeneous. Future reseacrh should prioritise feasibility, reliability, and user experience studies to inform the design of robust randomised controlled trials.

This scoping review comprehensively examines the use of conversational agents (CAs) in adult pain management. The study identified six applications of CAs to support pain management and highlights a lack of high‐quality randomised controlled trials, particularly those preceded by development and feasibility studies. Clinicians and researchers can use these insights to guide future studies and improve applications of CAs in pain management.

Pain is the most common reason for seeking care (Haas et al.2023; Khatami et al.2022). Approximately 30% of the world population reported moderate or severe pain in the last 30 days (Zimmer et al.2022), and many report pain that persists for 3 months or more (i.e., chronic pain) (Mills et al.2019). Pain‐related conditions, including headaches and musculoskeletal disorders (e.g., back pain, neck pain, knee pain), are the leading causes of years lived with disability worldwide (Vos et al.2020). Chronic pain is often associated with multiple factors, including psychological distress, depression, anxiety, sleep problems, activity limitation, social participation restrictions (Cohen et al.2021) and uncertainties regarding diagnosis, prognosis and treatment options (Lim et al.2019).

Digital health solutions have been proposed to improve healthcare quality by facilitating data collection for consultation, providing timely information on the most beneficial treatment options, and delivering cost‐effective interventions (WHO.2018). The use of conversational agents (CAs) in digital health solutions has become increasingly popular. A CA can be defined as a computer dialogue system that communicates with a human (Allouch et al.2021). With recent technological advancements, CAs commonly use artificial intelligence (AI), including natural language processing and generative AI, such as ChatGPT (Xue et al.2023), which may foster meaningful communication between users and machines (Xue et al.2023). Despite being underutilised, CAs emerge as a highly customisable element in healthcare for diverse populations, with largely unexplored potential beyond daily health reports, feedback, alerts and patient recommendations (Kocaballi et al.2019). Regarding chronic conditions, CAs have been used to deliver patient education, provide cognitive therapy protocols and offer emotional support in coping with chronic conditions (Uetova et al.2024).

Reviews have demonstrated that CAs are used in healthcare for various purposes, such as gathering health information, sending medication and appointment reminders, delivering information (Dingler et al.2021), providing mental health support, promoting physical activity and influencing health behaviours (Xue et al.2023). A systematic review with meta‐analysis showed that AI‐based CAs may be beneficial in reducing symptoms of distress and depression (Li et al.2023). However, the applications and effectiveness of CAs in supporting pain management have not yet been investigated. This scoping review aims to comprehensively evaluate the applications and effectiveness of CAs to support pain management in adults.

We conducted a scoping review to investigate the current applications and effectiveness of CAs for supporting pain management in adults. We reported the scoping review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses for Scoping Review (PRISMA‐ScR) reporting guidelines (Chen et al.2023). We did not formulate a hypothesis to investigate the applications of CAs for supporting pain management because it is a scoping review (Tricco et al.2016). However, since we expected to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), we formulated a specific hypothesis regarding the effectiveness of CAs in improving pain management (e.g., delivery of treatments, knowledge of health professionals) or outcomes. We hypothesised that CAs improve pain management and health outcomes compared to control groups. The protocol was prospectively registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF;https://osf.io/23p7g). We updated the protocol after the screening to provide details on how we plan to analyse and report the findings and quality of RCTs, following the significant inclusion of these trials in the scoping review.

We included studies with participants aged 18 years and older that recruited healthy individuals at risk of developing pain (e.g., healthy workers with physical demand at risk of developing back pain), individuals currently experiencing pain or health providers or students managing pain conditions.

The inclusion criteria were intentionally designed to comprehensively map the literature on CAs, reflecting the broader approach characteristic of scoping reviews (Tricco et al.2016). We included studies investigating the role of CAs in supporting pain management, which is defined as a coordinated and interdisciplinary approach that might involve consumers (e.g., patients), health providers and/or the healthcare system to alleviate suffering or improve the quality of life for individuals experiencing pain (Medicine,2012). We defined a CA as an independent dialogue system or computer program that can communicate (verbally or non‐verbally) with a human. These agents had to process inputs from speech, text, video or other sensors (Allouch et al.2021).

We included studies investigating CAs to understand the input provided by the user in a conversation style and deliver appropriate information, advice, feedback or actions, which can be conveyed via text, speech or by controlling a physical or virtual entity. There were no restrictions regarding length, frequency, technology or cointerventions. The CA had to be intended to manage pain, including but not limited to assessment, prevention, treatment and education.

We included pain‐related outcomes (e.g., pain intensity, pain interference), physical function, psychological outcomes (e.g., anxiety, depression) and user experience outcomes (e.g., engagement, usefulness).

We included all types of studies, including RCTs, pilot trials and observational studies (e.g., feasibility, qualitative) that investigated the role of CAs in pain management. We also included protocols for ongoing RCTs and published abstracts to provide a comprehensive overview of current research activity and identify emerging trends in the field. Including these sources is consistent with the purpose of scoping reviews, which aim to broadly map the literature and inform future systematic reviews or trials. This inclusive approach ensures a thorough understanding of the available evidence, even when outcome data still need to be reported, to facilitate the identification of potential gaps and areas for future research (Gottlieb et al.2021). There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication.

Studies were excluded if they focused on CAs unrelated to pain management (e.g., targeting general mental health or other non‐pain‐related domains), lacked details about the intervention or its functionality, included participants younger than 18 or were duplicate publications without unique data.

We searched six databases—MEDLINE PubMed, ACM Digital Library, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and five trial registries—EU Clinical Trials Register,ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) and OSF from inception. We used terms related to ‘conversational agents’ and ‘pain’ categories, separated by ‘OR’ within each term or ‘AND’ for terms across different categories. The search strategy is detailed in AppendixS1. In addition to searching scientific databases, we emailed the corresponding authors of all included studies and trial registrations to inquire whether the CAs studied were already commercially available or still under investigation. To ensure comprehensive information about the commercialisation status of all analysed technologies, we also conducted supplementary searches on Google.

We used Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation2023) to remove duplicates and screen records. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of all records and then the full text based on the eligibility criteria. Where multiple records of the same trial were present, preference was given to the most recent record and the record(s) that provided data for the review. In the case of disagreement, a third reviewer resolved the discrepancies during the screening process.

Two authors (R.R.N.R. and F.Y.) developed and pilot‐tested a data extraction form, which was used by at least two independent reviewers (H.B., R.R.N.R., Y.G., J.L. and M.J.) to extract data from all eligible records. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer when necessary. Data extraction focused on study characteristics, participant details, intervention and CA attributes and reported outcomes. A detailed description of the extracted variables, including classification criteria and rationale, is provided in AppendixS2.

The complex intervention evaluation framework, recommended by the Medical Research Council, guides the assessment of interventions across stages: development, feasibility, effectiveness and implementation. Our review also considered the commercialisation stage for interventions already available for patient acquisition outside experimental settings (Regier et al.2022). This framework acknowledges that, after initial evaluations (i.e., development and feasibility), further investigations (i.e., effectiveness, implementation, regulation) are necessary to ensure the healthcare intervention is safe, effective and implementable. Therefore, the present review organised the research output on CAs for pain management by the evaluation stage.

Where data was missing, we contacted study authors twice via email (1 week apart). Data were considered unobtainable if there was no reply within 1 week after the final email.

Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias in the RCTs using the Cochrane Risk‐of‐Bias‐2 (RoB2) tool (Sterne et al.2019). This tool assesses several domains of bias: bias from randomisation, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, outcome measurements and selective reporting. According to the RoB2 tool classifications, two reviewers judged the risk of bias as either low, some concerns or high.

As described in our preregistration, in the case of meta‐analysis, the certainty of evidence would be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations framework (GRADE, according to the protocol) (Brozek et al.2021). Scoping reviews, including the possibility of meta‐analysis, aim to generate evidence‐based maps and hypotheses. Our hypothesis for such an analysis is that CAs are more effective than controls in managing pain, consistent with the scoping meta‐review approach (Sarrami‐Foroushani et al.2015).

We retrieved 496 records from the search (Figure1), including 492 from the databases and four from other sources (i.e., searching the references of the included studies). After removing 114 duplicates, we screened 382 titles and abstracts for inclusion. We excluded 222 records due to wrong intervention (n= 105), wrong study design (n= 9), wrong population (n= 12) and wrong outcomes (n= 5). We retrieved the full text of 160 potentially eligible records. We included 28 articles, of which 17 were journal articles, four protocols, four trial registers and three abstracts.



PRISMA flow diagram.

The 28 articles included in our scoping review were published between 2011 and 2023, with 78% (n= 22) published in the past five years. The studies originated from nine countries, predominantly from the United States of America (n= 10, 35%). Study characteristics are outlined in Table1.

Study characteristics.

Demange et al. (2019)

Abbreviation: NR, not relevant or reported.

We identified six categories of study designs. There were nine observational studies (comprising 5 cross‐sectional studies, 1 case series, 1 case study and 2 cohort studies), 9 RCTs, 3 RCT protocols, 4 RCT trial registries and 2 RCT abstracts (comprising 15 parallel and 4 crossover trials).

Approximately half of the studies reported the setting where participants received the intervention (n= 16, 57%). The most common settings for investigating CAs in the studies were aged care facilities (n= 7, 25%) and outpatient settings (n= 6, 21%). Participants were primarily recruited through convenience sampling (n= 14, 50%) and local medical practices in which participants were already presenting for standard care (n= 7, 25%).

The 28 studies included 1252 participants in total. Most studies reported a sample size (n= 18, 68%). The median sample size was 65 participants, ranging from 1 to 208.

Sixteen (57%) studies reported age. The mean age of participants ranged from 32 (10.2 SD) to 86.48 (8.81 SD) years. Sixteen (57%) studies reported on sex distribution, with females comprising approximately 63% (n= 913) of these studies' total reported sample size. Seven (25%) studies reported on race, with the majority being White (75.3%). Only five (17%) studies reported on education, with one stating 43.1% of participants had a university degree, another reporting 57.1% had a 4‐year university degree or higher, and the last two reporting late primary school to early high school‐level education, one stating 22% of participants had at least 7 years of education.

We included studies investigating CAs in six conditions with pain as a central or common symptom, including pain and dementia (n= 7), cancer (n= 5), musculoskeletal conditions (n= 4), irritable bowel syndrome (n= 1), peripheral artery disease (n= 1) and abdominal conditions (n= 1).

The included studies, study types, population, country of the study, study objective and sample size are reported in Table1.

We identified four types of CAs, the most common being chatbot design (n= 13) (Table2). The others included therapeutic robotics (n= 7), which could communicate through body language; virtual reality/assistant/coach (n= 7), which refers to the use of an avatar or digital rendering of an individual; and computer‐aided learning system design (n= 1), which broadly refers to the use of integrative technology to assist user learning on a particular subject. We identified six intervention intentions describing the role of the CAs (Figure2). The most common intention was to capture health information (n= 8), followed by providing emotional support (n= 7), facilitating adherence to self‐management physical exercises (n= 6), providing psychological treatment for pain management (n= 5), offering organisational support (n= 1) and educating health care providers (n= 1).

The purpose of the interventions used in the included studies.

The knowledge domain of the CAs was mostly closed (n= 24, 85%) and constrained to specific pre‐programmed topics (n= 15, 53%). The service provided by the CAs was mostly for transmitting information without much intimate connection to users (i.e., interpersonal;n= 16, 57%). The goal of the CAs' interactions was largely conversational (n= 14, 50%) and informative (n= 11, 39%).

Most studies required communication with the CAs at least once a week (n= 15, 53%), including daily use (n= 5), weekly use (n= 3), five times a week (n= 5), at least three times a week (n= 2) and self‐paced (n= 2). The other studies did not report communication frequency, or the frequency was unclear.

The complex intervention evaluation framework was used to evaluate the included studies (AppendixS2). We identified studies in the development (n= 1, < 1%), feasibility (n= 8, 28%), effectiveness (n= 18, 64%), implementation (n= 1, < 1%) and commercialisation (n= 13, 46%) stages (Figure3).



Number of studies in each evaluation stage of the lifecycle of healthcare interventions.

Five CAs had been commercialised and featured in 13 of our included studies (46%). Of these, the marketed focus ranged from mental health (PARO; Wysa) to pain reduction (Secaide), quality of life improvement (BD4QoL) and irritable bowel syndrome management (Zemedy). In the other 15 studies, commercialisation had not been reported (n= 7, 25%) or was not clearly reported (n= 9, 32%). None of the commercialised CAs included in the studies followed all four translation research stages (development, feasibility, effectiveness and implementation). Most commercialised CAs have conducted at least one effectiveness trial, but only one (PARO) conducted a feasibility study before the effectiveness trial.

Twenty of the included studies reported outcomes. Our primary outcomes of interest were pain, physical function and evaluation of CAs. There were three pain‐related outcomes: pain intensity, pain interference and pain communication. Physical function was reported in five studies. Evaluation of the CAs was reported across two domains: engagement (n= 9) and usefulness (n= 5). Psychological outcomes were reported in six studies. Outcomes related to depression (n= 4), anxiety (n= 3) and stress (n= 1) were reported. Other qualitative self‐reported outcomes were also noted, such as distress in practical problems among patients (n= 1) and effort, mental demand and frustration among health professionals (n= 1). AppendixS2shows outcome measures of interest stratified by the evaluation stage.

One study reported data from the development phase of a computer‐aided learning system. The study compared the accuracy of different machine learning models to predict five diagnoses related to abdominal pain. The goal of the development stage was to utilise the most appropriate model to generate personalised feedback for students about specific patient information requested and their diagnostic hypotheses.

All eight feasibility studies measured users' experiences with CAs, including engagement (n= 5), gestures participants used with the CA to express pain (n= 1), empathy and perceived intelligence of the CA using questionnaires (n= 1) and general experiences with the CA through interviews with users (n= 3). Three feasibility studies compared the effects on pain‐related outcomes (n= 3), physical function (n= 2) and psychological factors (n= 2) between baseline and post‐intervention. The results are heterogeneous.

Six RCTs reported results on pain intensity. All six studies reported differences between groups. Four studies that reported differences between groups found significant improvements in pain intensity. The other two studies found no significant differences.

Two RCTs reported results on pain interference. Both studies reported differences between groups, with no significant group differences.

One RCT reported results on pain communication, indicating a difference between groups. Participants in the intervention group who used the CA to report their pain described, on average, one additional item about their experience (i.e., expressed more pain‐related content) than the control group (i.e., people who viewed a videotape with or without a practitioner pain coach in the videotape).

Two prospective cohort studies reported results on physical function. Both studies reported no significant differences within groups.

Four RCTs reported results on psychological outcomes.

Two studies measured outcomes related to depression. One study reported no difference between groups. Another study showed that CA improved depressive symptoms in the completer analysis. However, the benefits ceased to be statistically significant when the intention‐to‐treat analysis was included.

One RCT that reported anxiety outcomes showed no differences between groups. One study measured distress‐related outcomes (0 to 10 scale, 10 being the worst on practical everyday issues) with no significant differences between groups. Another RCT reported outcomes for stress, showing statistically significant differences between groups.

Additionally, one RCT focused on psychological outcomes among healthcare professionals treating patients exposed to CA, finding significant changes within groups in feelings of frustration, mental demand and effort before and after these interventions.

Of the 18 RCTs included in our scoping review, the risk of bias assessment was not possible for nine studies: protocols (n= 3), trial registries (n= 4) or abstracts (n= 2). We assessed nine RCTs for risk of bias (AppendixS2) and provided a summary for the risk‐of‐bias assessment (RoB 2) in Figure4.



Risk‐of‐bias summary of the included RCTs in the scoping review.

Our scoping review investigated the applications and effectiveness of CAs for supporting pain management in adults. CAs differ from other digital health interventions by providing an interactive, adaptive and often personalised user experience. While traditional digital interventions, such as mobile apps and web‐based programmes, typically rely on static content delivery, CAs engage users through real‐time dialogue, enabling dynamic responses based on user input (Laranjo et al.2018). We showed that the interest in CAs for pain management is relatively new; most published and unpublished studies (90%) have been reported between 2019 and 2024. Most CAs for pain management were designed to capture health information, facilitate adherence to self‐management and offer emotional/psychological support for patients. CAs have been studied mainly in people with chronic pain‐related conditions such as cancer pain, musculoskeletal conditions, dementia, irritable bowel syndrome, peripheral artery disease and abdominal conditions when patient‐centred assessments, information, advice and self‐management approaches play a critical role in the treatment (Carville et al.2021).

Among these conditions, dementia is particularly relevant given the high prevalence of pain in this population and the challenges associated with its assessment and management (e.g., cognitive decline and communication barriers). Nearly half of individuals diagnosed with dementia have at least one documented pain‐related condition (Lin et al.2018) and co‐occurring chronic pain significantly exacerbates self‐care limitations and disability (Haque et al.2025). Digital health solutions, such as CAs, might assist caregivers in tracking cognitive and symptom changes, monitoring daily routines and providing structured reminders for essential tasks, such as taking medication, maintaining hydration or engaging in social activities. Given the growing interest in AI‐driven tools for healthcare, further research is warranted to explore how CAs can effectively support underserved populations (Lott et al.2024).

Most of the research on CAs for pain management intended to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention (18/28, 64%). However, only half of the RCTs have been published (i.e., other studies were described in protocols and trial registries without results). Of 14 unique technologies identified in the 18 RCTs, only one reported being investigated in a feasibility study to guide the main trial (Pu et al.2019), and none provided sufficient details or references on how the CA was developed for the trial. This is concerning because the lack of development (e.g., reliability of the tool) and feasibility studies (e.g., usability, usefulness, acceptability, desirability of the tool in a particular context) before conducting RCTs may interfere with the recruitment process, follow‐up rates, effectiveness and adherence to the intervention (Martinengo et al.2023).

Each translational stage (i.e., development, feasibility, effectiveness and implementation) can provide insightful details about the technological aspects of the CAs, users' experiences or effectiveness of the intervention and support commercialisation and clinical application (Wang et al.2023). Most commercialised CAs (4/5, 80%) were evaluated through RCTs specific to pain management. The CA without an RCT for pain conditions, Wysa, has been investigated in several feasibility studies and has been incorporated in an ongoing RCT for mental health (NCT059434182023). Regulatory agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA (The Food and Drug Administration [FDA]2023) and the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in Australia (The Therapeutic Goods Administration [TGA]2024), regulate the commercialisation process of digital technologies for medical and well‐being purposes. The regulation for medical purposes has more stringent regulatory controls, including the tool's reliability and transparency, efficacy and safety assessments, which implies that most CAs would not be approved if the primary intention is to change patients' health outcomes.

Most CAs for pain management required users to use text messages as the primary mode of communication (i.e., text‐based input interface), whereas some used voice, and a few used gesture and movement input modes. Stand‐alone text‐message interaction is commonly used to provide health education and psychological support and capture patient health information. Multimodal input or output interfaces (e.g., text, voice or visual) are commonly used to provide education or emotional support to patients. Gesture/movement interfaces are combined with virtual reality, avatars or robots to provide emotional support to patients.

CAs for pain management commonly use AI, and some use NLP or machine learning technologies. Most technologies are characterised by a closed knowledge domain (i.e., questions have a predefined answer), constrained (i.e., pre‐programmed options) and interpersonal (i.e., without much intimate connection with users). This is expected to change in the years to come due to the popularity of Open AI technology, which allows users to interact with the CA on various topics without being limited to a specific set of answers. In our scoping review, we only identified one recent RCT protocol, published in 2023 (Blasco et al.2023), using an open knowledge domain, unconstrained and intrapersonal user interaction. After knee replacement, this text‐based chatbot will be given to patients to increase adherence to home physiotherapy.

Most studies did not explicitly report the characteristics of the CAs. Our research team occasionally used external sources to identify the technology and service provision and determine if the CA had been commercialised. Poor reporting of interventions is common in medical research (McGrath et al.2024) but may be improved through reporting guidelines. In 2020, two reporting guideline extensions for interventions involving artificial intelligence were published: The SPIRIT‐AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials‐Artificial Intelligence) for protocols (Liu et al.2020) and the CONSORT‐AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials‐Artificial Intelligence) for clinical trials (Rivera et al.2020). The CHART (Chatbot Assessment Reporting Tool) reporting guideline has been developed to improve the reporting standards of chatbot assessment studies (Collaborative2024). As these guidelines are recent, the studies evaluated in this scoping review did not have these tools available to guide the reporting of their findings; however, we recommend that future research adopt reporting guidelines to improve the quality of evidence.

The effects of CAs on patient outcomes are still very uncertain. The RCTs were judged as having a high or some risk of bias, and we could not pool the effects of CAs primarily due to the population's heterogeneity. Overall, CAs using psychoeducation and emotional support appeared not to provide significant benefits in reducing pain interference and function, with mixed results in reducing pain intensity and psychological factors related to chronic pain conditions. Although CAs can be used to improve evidence‐based practice and facilitate shared decision‐making, the current studies in pain management do not explore these applications. Our finding is consistent with a recent Cochrane systematic review that did not find CAs used as decision aids in 209 RCTs (Stacey et al.2024). Decision‐making tools to faciliate evidence‐based practice commonly use paper‐based or web‐based platforms.

Recently, the potential of using CAs has been increasingly discussed in healthcare, including pain management (Martinengo et al.2023; Rossettini et al.2023). For patients, based on input collected in standardised questionnaires or conversational manner, CAs can provide tailored information on rehabilitation exercises, pain management strategies and self‐care techniques, remind patients to use effective communication strategies to self‐manage their conditions, and translate medical terminologies into patient‐friendly language to close the gap between evidence and practice. Chatbots can assist clinicians in clinical reasoning, diagnosis and administrative tasks, such as summarising patients' reports and scheduling and delivering shared decision‐making. Besides their potential applications, CAs also pose risks such as privacy concerns, misinformation, lack of personalisation, overreliance on technology, dataset bias and errors. These challenges can be partially mitigated through transparent development, feasibility and effectiveness studies and regulatory assessments before commercialisation.

This study has some limitations that should be noted. Despite combining different study designs, conducting a meta‐analysis of the included RCTs was impossible due to the high heterogeneity among their populations, interventions, comparisons and individual analyses. After screening initial records, we clarified in our protocol registration that the GRADE assessment would be conducted only if meta‐analyses were performed. Although we use a broad definition for CAs based on previous studies, we acknowledge that CAs may be defined differently (Martinengo et al.2023), which could have potentially affected the inclusion of studies in our scoping review. Another limitation of this review is that although we did not restrict the inclusion of studies based on language, our literature search was conducted exclusively in English‐language databases, which may have inadvertently limited our review to predominantly English‐language studies.

This scoping review found the use of CAs to support pain management is relatively new, with most studies published in the last 5 years. Currently, CAs are used in pain management to provide education, emotional and psychological support, and to capture health data in a more natural and interactive way to guide treatment and facilitate decision‐making, particularly for chronic pain conditions. The effectiveness of CAs in changing pain‐related outcomes remains highly uncertain. Meta‐analyses cannot be conducted due to a lack of trials examining similar conditions. In addition, we found that there were more RCTs than preliminary studies, such as qualitative studies, reliability assessments and feasibility trials, conducted before the trials. Future RCTs should be informed by preliminary findings on users' experiences, the reliability of CAs and feasibility studies.

It has been demonstrated that the implementation of rapid response teams (RRT) may improve clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, predictors of mortality among patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) or to the step-down unit (SDU) after a RRT activation are not fully understood.

To describe clinical characteristics, resource use, main outcomes, and to address predictors of in-hospital mortality among patients admitted to the ICU/SDU after RRT activation.

Retrospective single-center cohort study conducted in a medical-surgical ICU/SDU located in a private quaternary care hospital. Adult patients admitted to the ICU or SDU between 2012 and 2020 were compared according to in-hospital mortality. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of in-hospital mortality.

Among the 3841 patients included in this analysis [3165 (82.4%) survivors and 676 (17.6%) non-survivors], 1972 (51.3%) were admitted to the ICU and 1869 (48.7%) were admitted to the SDU. Compared to survivors, non-survivors were older [76 (64–87) yrs. vs. 67 (50–81) yrs.; p < 0.001], had a higher SAPS 3 score [64 (56–72) vs. 49 (40–57); p < 0.001], and had a longer length of stay (LOS) before unit admission [8 (3–19) days vs. 2 (1–7) days; p < 0.001). Non-survivors used more non-invasive ventilation (NIV) (42.2% vs. 20.9%; p < 0.001), mechanical ventilation (MV) (36.7% vs. 9.3%; p < 0.001), vasopressors (39.2% vs. 12.3%; p < 0.001), renal replacement therapy (15.5% vs. 4.3%; p < 0.001), and blood components transfusion (34.9% vs. 14.0%; p < 0.001). Independent predictors of in-hospital mortality were the SAPS 3 score, the Charlson Comorbidity Index, LOS before unit admission, immunosuppression, respiratory rate < 8 or > 28 ipm criteria for RRT activation, RRT activation during the night shift, and the need for high-flow nasal cannula, NIV, MV, vasopressors, and blood components transfusion.

Multiple factors may affect outcomes of ICU/SDU-admitted patients after RRT activation. Therefore, efforts should be made to boost RRT effectiveness to improve patient safety.

Failure to promptly recognize and address clinical deterioration stands as a primary contributor to harm among hospitalized patients [1–3]. The endorsement of Rapid Response Teams (RRT), also known as Medical Emergency Teams (MET), aims to decrease harm and improve safety for hospitalized patients, and has been supported by the Institute of Healthcare Improvement (IHI) [4] as well as by various medical specialty societies [5,6]. The RRT is, by definition, a multidisciplinary emergency team composed of trained intensive care unit (ICU) physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists who provide specialized care to patients presenting clinical deterioration outside the ICU [4–6].

It has been demonstrated that the implementation of RRT may improve inpatient care outcomes by providing a proactive and timely response to clinical deterioration, thereby mitigating unsafe ICU transfers, the development of cardiac arrest, and death [7–9]. Furthermore, several safety mechanisms and tools have been developed and incorporated into healthcare systems to further improve inpatient security and clinical outcomes [10–15]. For instance, the use of early warning score systems such as the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) [11] and the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) [10] allow an early identification of clinical deterioration in ward patients, triggering prompt and timely interventions to prevent the occurrence of deleterious events. Moreover, safety huddles [12,14], telemetry monitoring [13], and the identification of patients at a higher risk of clinical deterioration outside the ICU, commonly referred to as “watchers” [15,16], have demonstrated promising results in enhancing safety awareness among multidisciplinary care teams [17].

Nevertheless, predictors of in-hospital mortality among patients admitted to the ICU or to the step-down unit (SDU) following RRT activation are not completely understood. We postulated that patient-related factors [i.e., age, comorbidities, frailty, reason for hospitalization, and length of hospital stay (LOS) before RRT activation] and RRT activation factors (i.e., trigger, time span between clinical deterioration, and activation and response time) may be associated with in-hospital mortality in patients admitted to the ICU/SDU after RRT activation. Therefore, our primary objective was to address the predictors of in-hospital mortality among this patient cohort. Secondary objectives included describing clinical characteristics, resource use, and main outcomes.

Retrospective, single-center cohort study. This study was approved by the local Ethics Committee at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein (CAAE: 40072720.0.0000.0071), and the need for informed consent was waived. This study was reported in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement [18].

This study was conducted in a private quaternary care hospital located in São Paulo, Brazil. The Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein has 724 inpatient beds. Of these, 54 were open medical-surgical adult ICU beds, and 95 were adult SDU beds. The SDU serves patients considered too unstable to be admitted to the wards but without requiring the full availability of resources in an ICU, and patients discharged from the ICU recovering from a critical condition.

All adult (≥18 years) patients admitted to ICU or SDU after RRT activation between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2020, were eligible for this study. The exclusion criteria comprise pediatric patients (<18 years), admissions after blue code activation (unexpected cardiac or respiratory arrest), and ICU/SDU readmissions. In the case of recurrent RRT activation and ICU/SDU admission for the same patient, only the first ICU/SDU admission was included in this analysis. Patients under end-of-life care or no escalation of treatment order are usually not eligible for RRT activation. Therefore, these patients were not included in this analysis.

All study data were retrieved from an institutional yellow code data bank, and from Epimed Monitor System® (Epimed Solutions, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) [19], which are structured electronic case report forms where patients’ data are prospectively entered by trained hospital case managers. All data were extracted by an independent research assistant who did not participate in this study. All data were fully anonymized before being made available to the researchers. The data were accessed and extracted on 28/06/2021.

The collected variables included demographics, comorbidities, Simpliﬁed Acute Physiology Score (SAPS 3 score) [20], Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score [21] at ICU/SDU admission, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) [22], Modified Frailty Index (MFI) [23], reason for ICU or SDU admission, the MEWS [10] at the moment of RRT activation, reason for RRT activation, patient’s location before unit admission, the time elapsed between patient deterioration and RRT activation, the time between RRT activation and the team’s arrival, destination after RRT activation (ICU or SDU), resource use and organ support [vasopressors, non-invasive ventilation (NIV), high flow nasal cannula (HFNC), mechanical ventilation (MV), renal replacement therapy (RRT) and blood components transfusion] during the first hour of ICU/SDU admission and during the ICU/SDU stay, unit and hospital length of stay (LOS), and hospital mortality.

The intensivist-led RRT was implemented in our institution in 2008. The RRT is headed by a senior staff member, who is available 24 hours a day and has expertise in critical patient care, airway management, and advanced cardiovascular life support.

Criteria to activate the RRT included at least one of the following: peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) < 90%, respiratory rate < 8 or > 28 incursions per minute (ipm), systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 90 mmHg or SBP > 180 mmHg, heart rate < 40 or > 130 beats per minute (bpm), altered neurological status, seizures, MEWS > 6 points, and a multidisciplinary staff member expressing significant concern about the patient condition (“worried” staff). The RRT is activated via a dedicated single emergency telephone number (Yellow Code). Once activated, the RRT was expected to assess the patient within five minutes and define the patient’s subsequent allocation based on clinical judgment and institutional protocols. Additionally, unexpected cardiac or respiratory arrest on the wards is managed by a specialized team known as the Blue Code team. This team, led by a senior certified cardiologist in advanced cardiac life support, is also available 24 hours a day.

Categorical variables were reported as absolute and relative frequencies, while continuous variables were presented as median with interquartile ranges (IQR). Normality was evaluated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

Comparisons were performed between survival and non-survival patients. Categorical variables were compared with the X2test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. Continuous variables were compared using an independentt-test or the Mann–Whitney U test in cases of non-normal distribution.

Univariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify which predictors were associated with in-hospital mortality. Multivariable logistic regression analyses with a backward elimination procedure, including all the predictors showing a p-value < 0.20 in the univariable analysis, were undertaken to obtain an adjusted odds ratio (OR) along with 95% confidence interval (CI) and to identify which predictors were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Therefore, the final model contained only variables significantly associated with in-hospital mortality after a multivariable backward logistic regression analysis.

To avoid collinearity, the characteristics included in the SAPS 3 score (namely, age) and the comorbidities included in the CCI [namely, diabetes mellitus, chronic heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), solid tumor, liver cirrhosis, hematological malignancy, and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)] were not individually added to the model. Collinearity was assessed using the variance inflation factor (VIF). A VIF > 2.5 was arbitrarily defined as an indicator of collinearity.

We tested the linearity assumption for continuous variables included in logistic regression models by analyzing the interaction between each predictor and its own log (natural log transformation) [24]. Whenever the linearity assumption was violated, continuous numerical variables were categorized [24]. Final multivariable logistic regression model discrimination [area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)] and calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-square statistic) were reported [25].

Two-tailed tests were used, and statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. All analyses were performed using the IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Statistics for Macintosh, version 28 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).

Between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2020, there were 412,385 hospital admissions and 12,753 RRT activations. Of these, 5,531 (43.4%) resulted in ICU or SDU admissions after RRT activation. After the exclusion of 1,690 ICU/SDU admissions due to ICU/SDU readmissions after RRT activation, admissions after code blue activation, and age below 18 years, 3,841 patients were included in the final analysis. Among these, 3,165 (82.4%) patients were survivors, while 676 (17.6%) were non-survivors (Fig 1). Among the non-survivors, 34.4% (232/676 patients) died during the ICU/SDU stay.

The baseline characteristics of the studied patients are presented inTable 1. Compared to survivors, non-survivors were older [76 (64–87) vs. 67 (50–81) years; p < 0.001], had a higher proportion of males (55.5% vs. 49.7%; p = 0.007), a higher SAPS 3 score [64 (56–72) vs. 49 (40–57) points; p < 0.001], a higher SOFA score [4 (2–7) vs. 1 (0–3) points; p < 0.001], were more frequently frail (21.6% vs. 11.5%; p < 0.001), had a higher CCI [3 (2–6) vs. 1 (0–3) points; p < 0.001], a longer LOS before unit admission [8 (3–19) vs. 2 (1–7) days; p < 0.001], exhibited a higher prevalence of solid tumors (44.4% vs. 25.6%; p < 0.001), immunosuppression (35.9% vs. 16.5%; p < 0.001), chronic heart failure (18.5% vs. 12.3%; p < 0.001), hematological malignancy (14.3% vs. 5.7%; p < 0.001) and chronic kidney disease (14.1% vs. 7.9%; p < 0.001) (Table 1).

NYHA classification for heart failure is based on the severity of the symptoms, it ranges from I to IV, and Class IV indicates that the patient is unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort, symptoms of heart failure in rest, and if any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort increases.

Most RRT activations occurred on the ward (93.6%) and approximately half of them during the night shift (Table 2). The main reason for RRT activation was a multidisciplinary staff member “worried” about the patient’s condition (64.2%), followed by SpO2< 90% (30.8%) and SBP < 90 mmHg (20.4%). Notably, only 22.2% of activations were based solely on the subjective ‘worried’ criterion. The median (IQR) time between patient deterioration and RRT activation and between RRT activation and team arrival was, respectively, 3 (2–6) minutes and 3 (2–5) minutes. Out of the 3,841 patients attended by RRT, 1,972 (51.3%) were transferred to the ICU, and 1,869 (48.7%) were transferred to the SDU (Table 2).

Compared to survivors, non-survivors had a higher frequency of RRT activation triggered by SpO2< 90% (44.1% vs. 28.0%; p < 0.001), respiratory rate < 8 ipm or > 28 ipm (27.4% vs. 13.9%; p < 0.001), SBP < 90 mmHg (23.2% vs. 19.8%; p = 0.043) and altered neurological status (22.3% vs. 12.6%; p < 0.001), and were more commonly transferred to the ICU (68.8% vs. 47.6%; p < 0.001) (Table 2).

Whitin the first hour of ICU/SDU admission, non-survivors used NIV (23.2% vs. 11.0%; p < 0.001), MV (12.0% vs. 3.9%; p < 0.001), and vasopressors (15.8% vs. 5.0%; p < 0.001) more frequently compared to survivors (Table 3). The utilization of supportive therapies during the entire ICU/SDU stay was also higher among non-survivors: NIV (42.2% vs. 20.9%; p < 0.001), MV (36.7% vs. 9.3%; p < 0.001), vasopressors (39.2% vs. 12.3%; p < 0.001), renal replacement therapy (15.5% vs. 4.3%; p < 0.001), and blood components transfusion (34.9% vs. 14.0%; p < 0.001) (Table 3). Additionally, non-survivors had a more prolonged unit [3 (1–8) vs. 2 (1–4) days; p < 0.001] and hospital [27 (14–58) vs. 11 (5–24) days; p < 0.001] LOS compared to survivors (Table 3).

The results of univariable and multivariate logistic regression analysis are presented inTable 4. Independent predictors of increased in-hospital mortality on the multivariate analysis included the SAPS 3 score, the CCI, LOS before unit admission, presence of immunosuppression, respiratory rate < 8 or > 28 ipm criteria for RRT activation, RRT activation during the night shift, and the need for HFNC, NIV, MV, vasopressors, and blood components transfusion during the ICU/SDU stay (Table 4).

The multivariable model (n = 3350 patients) had an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (95%CI) of 0.85 (0.83–0.86) and a Hosmer-Lemeshow χ2 of 19,867 (p = 0.011).

In this single-center retrospective cohort study, we found that patients admitted to the ICU/SDU due to clinical deterioration and RRT activation often required organ support therapies, mainly NIV, vasopressors, and blood transfusion. Furthermore, approximately one in five patients who had RRT activation and who were admitted to the ICU/SDU did not survive to hospital discharge. Additionally, there were several predictors of increased mortality among patients with clinical instability attended by RRT.

Hospitalized patients attended by RRT are commonly characterized by advanced age, the presence of multiple comorbidities and frailty, which have been associated with an increased risk of poor clinical outcomes [2,26–30]. Moreover, patients who had RRT activation often required bedside interventions and organ support therapies [26,31,32]. Goh and cols demonstrated that approximately 80% of patients who required RRT activation needed at least one intervention, mainly ICU/SDU admission, point-of-care ultrasound, fluid administration, vasopressors, and endotracheal intubation [32]. Therefore, the adoption of effective safety protocols and proactive interventions that allow an early recognition and prompt assessment of patients with clinical instability outside the ICU/SDU has been recommended [4,6,33,34].

Triggers for RRT activation vary widely among different institutions [28,29,35]. Similarly to our findings, Shappell and cols., using a large multicenter registry of patients attended by RRT across the United States, demonstrated that SBP, hospital LOS before RRT call, and respiratory rate were important predictors of in-hospital mortality [29]. Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that RRT activation based on subjective criteria, i.e., a multidisciplinary staff concern about patients’ clinical condition in the absence of a specific physiologic trigger (also known as “worried” staff or “nursing concern”) represents an important tool that allows the multidisciplinary team to escalate care aiming to prevent adverse events in hospitalized patients [36]. We found that approximately two-thirds of all RRT activations were triggered by the “worried” criteria in association with any other physiologic criteria, and approximately one-fifth of RRT were activated exclusively by “worried” staff criteria. Similar results were reported by other authors in a cluster randomized trial conducted in 23 hospitals addressing the characteristics and frequency of triggers for emergency team activation [37].

We demonstrated that the patient’s comorbidity (CCI and immunosuppression) and severity (SAPS 3 score), LOS before unit admission, respiratory depression or tachypnea, RRT activation during the night shift, and the need for supportive therapy during the unit stay were independent predictors of in-hospital death among patients admitted to the ICU/SDU after RRT activation. Although the SAPS 3 score was originally developed to predict mortality upon ICU admission [20], our findings suggest that it may also serve as a marker of poor outcomes in patients admitted to the ICU/SDU after a RRT activation. In addition, comorbidities play a significant role in the outcomes of patients requiring RRT activation. For example, patients with hematological malignancies who require RRT activation face a higher risk of adverse outcomes [38]. The participation of RRT in these instances can facilitate prompt identification of clinical deterioration, which has been associated with faster ICU admissions and reduced SOFA scores during the ICU stays [39].

Moreover, it has been demonstrated that a prolonged LOS prior to the RRT activation [29,40–43], code activation during the night shift [28,44], and the need for life support therapies [41,43,45] are important risk factors for in-hospital death among patients receiving RRT calls. For instance, Calzavacca and cols. identified vasopressor use as a predictor of in-hospital mortality in patients receiving multiple RRT activations [41], while Lee and cols demonstrated that the duration of hospitalization before RRT activation, and the need for endotracheal intubation were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality [43]. Additionally, the presence of respiratory failure at the time of RRT activation should be considered as a warning sign; Schneider’s research demonstrates that NIV use at the time of RRT activation is associated with a higher risk of ICU admission, underscoring the critical role of respiratory monitoring in the RRT context [46].

Although previous studies have demonstrated an association between delayed RRT activation and increased in-hospital mortality [47,48], we were unable to confirm this association in our analysis. The low median time between patient deterioration and RRT activation and between RRT activation and team arrival observed in our cohort and differences in organizational characteristics between our center and other institutions may explain, at least partially, these discrepant results.

Our study has limitations. First, the observational nature of this study and the identification of several factors associated with increased mortality do not necessarily imply causation. Second, this study was conducted in a single center, where RRT was implemented more than 15 years ago. Conversely, our findings may not apply to hospitals that have recently adopted RRT. Third, we did not investigate the impact of recurrence of RRT activation on outcomes [2,47,49]. Fourth, our study was limited to a cohort of patients admitted to the ICU/SDU following RRT activation, which precluded us from assessing patients attended by RRT but not transferred to the ICU/SDU. Finally, although respiratory distress is a well-established predictor of worse outcomes in patients following RRT activation, our results may have been affected by patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections admitted to the UCU/SDU during the COVID-19 pandemic [50].

Patients admitted to the intensive care unit or step-down unit after RRT often required organ support and exhibited an increased risk of death. Multiple factors may affect the clinical outcomes of ICU/SDU-admitted patients after RRT activation. Therefore, efforts should be made to boost RRT effectiveness to improve quality of care and patient safety.

A 66‐year‐old male patient diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure with reduced EF (32%), and complete left bundle branch block (CLBBB) received cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)‐D implantation. Left bundle branch pacing (LBBP) was successfully performed, but during the follow‐up 6 weeks later, the electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a sinus rhythm tracked by ventricular pacing with a ratio of approximately 2:1 due to T‐wave over‐sensing, which might be caused by the changes in T‐wave morphology due to electrotonic modulation and hyperkalemia or by the lower sensitivity threshold set by the auto sensing algorithm of the ICD.

A 66‐year‐old male patient received successful left bundle branch pacing, but the follow‐up electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a sinus rhythm tracked by ventricular pacing with a ratio of approximately 2:1 due to T‐wave over‐sensing, which affected the efficacy of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Shortening post‐ventricular atrial refractory period (PVARP) restored the ventricular pacing tracking of the atrium, and the T‐wave changes improved as time went by.



A 66‐year‐old male patient presented with dyspnea on exertion had been admitted to the hospital repeatedly for 4 years. The patient had a past medical history of chronic kidney failure (Scr: 286 μmol/L upon admission). Only mild stenosis was found in coronary angiography. Electrocardiogram (ECG) manifested a wide QRS complex with CLBBB pattern (Figure1a, QRS 164 ms), which was accordant with the diagnostic criteria of true CLBBB proposed by Strauss et al. (2011). Echocardiography showed an increased left ventricular diastolic diameter (LVDd) of 60 mm and a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 32%. He was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy (NYHA III) and had received optimized medication for more than 1 year without any improvement, at which point cardiac resynchronization therapy was indicated. Thus, the patient received CRT‐D implantation in our center.



Surface electrocardiograms (ECG) of the patient. (a) ECG of the patient before the procedure. Sinus rhythm, CLBBB, which was according to the criteria of Strauss. The duration of the QRS complex was 165 ms, and the QT interval was 460 ms. QTc was 541 ms. (b) ECG after the procedure with optimal programming. Narrow QRS complex (97 ms) with significant T‐wave inversion. QTc was 429 ms. (c) ECG 6 weeks after implantation. Sinus rhythm (80 bpm), tracked by ventricular pacing with a ratio of approximately 2:1. c‐1 intrinsic QRS complex. c‐2 QRS under LBBP with optimal programming. c‐3 a fusion of pacing and intrinsic conduction. QTc under pacing was 503 ms. (d) ECG 12 weeks after implantation. Sinus rhythm, tracked by ventricular pacing with a ratio of 1:1. QT interval was 402 ms. QTc was 421 ms.

The defibrillation lead was implanted into the apical area of the right ventricle; afterwards, the pacing lead (model 3830, 69 cm, Medtronic Inc.) was delivered through a fixed‐curve sheath (C315 His, Medtronic Inc.) into the His bundle area. Electrogram under intrinsic conduction was then recorded, showing His potential with an HV interval of 62 ms (Figure2a). LBBB could be corrected completely when pacing under 10 V/0.5 ms at this position, partially corrected under 5v/0.5 ms and failed in correcting the LBBB under 2v/0.5 ms (Figure2b–d). Another 3830 lead was positioned about 1.0 cm away from the primary lead and headed to the apex, where the pacing QRS morphology presented a “W” type in the V1 lead. The pacing lead was screwed under careful monitoring until the pacing QRS presented a QR morphology and the stimulus to left ventricular activation time (Sti‐LVAT) stayed stable (87 ms) under both high and low output (Figure2e,f). The first lead (3830) for HBP was then withdrawn and implanted into the right atrium septal, and CRT‐D (D364TRG, Medtronic Inc.) was applied.



Intracardiac electrograms (EGM) during the procedure. (a) EGM under intrinsic conduction. His potential was recorded. HV interval was 62 ms. (b–d) EGM under HBP with different outputs, from 10 V to 2 V. The CLBBB was corrected completely when pacing under 10 V/0.5 ms, partially corrected under 5v/0.5 ms, and failed in correcting the LBBB under 2v/0.5 ms. (e, f) EGM under LBBP with high and low output, respectively, shared the same stim‐LVAT (87 ms). When pacing under the threshold output (0.3v/0.5 ms), the QRS morphology presented an rSR pattern in V1, with an equipotential line between the stimulus and the QRS complex, which was identified as a selective LBBP pattern.

The patient received optimal program and medication therapy including irbesartan, metoprolol, and spironolactone before discharge. When the sensed atrioventricular delay (SAVD) was set to 100 ms, the pacing QRS complex presented a full normalization with ST‐T changes and a QT interval of 429 ms (Figure1b). Six weeks after the CRT‐D implantation, the patient came back for a routine follow‐up without any discomfort. Upon physical examination, the heart rhythm was found to be regular, but the heart sound alternated from strong to weak beat to beat. ECG showed a sinus rhythm tracked by ventricular pacing with a ratio of approximately 2:1 (Figure1c). Interrogation of the pacemaker revealed T‐wave over‐sensing (TWO) after ventricular pacing, which resulted in some P waves falling in the post‐ventricular atrial refractory period (PVARP) and failing to trigger the following ventricular pacing (Figure3a). The blood test showed hyperkalemia (6.1 mmol/L). The level of potassium ion decreased to normal (5.2 mmol/L) after treatment, and the pacemaker was reprogrammed by changing the ventricular sensing polarity and reducing the ventricular sensitivity. However, the TWO could not be eliminated with these methods. Therefore, PVARP was shortened during pacemaker programming to restore ventricular pacing tracking of the atrial signal with a ratio of 1:1 (Figure3b). During the next follow‐up 3 months later, the patient's heart function improved to NYHA I, with ECG showing sinus rhythm, alleviated T‐wave inversion, and a QT interval of 402 ms (Figure1d). Device intracardiac electrogram (IEGM) revealed no T‐wave over‐sensing (Figure3c). The chest X‐ray showed a remarkable reversion of cardiomegaly with the cardio‐thoracic ratio decreasing from 0.66 to 0.48, while echo showed a decreased LVDd of 43 mm and an elevated EF of 69%.



Device Intracardiac electrograms after procedure. (a, b) EGM before and after reprogramming 6 weeks after procedure. (a) There are three different patterns of QRS complexes that appear in “trigeminy” from Lead I: narrow, intermediate, and widened. The first narrow QRS complex was the optimal result of LBBP merging with intrinsic right bundle branch conduction, but the following TWO resulted in the pacemaker reaching its upper tracking rate limit and triggered the prolongation of SAVD, which in turn led to an intermediate fusion beat formed by the improper merging of intrinsic and paced QRS. Moreover, the progressive prolongation of SAVD resulted in the delay of QRS complex and subsequent TWO, causing the next intrinsic atrial signal to fall into PVARP and fail to trigger ventricular pacing, which led to the widened baseline CLBBB QRS morphology. (b) PVARP was shortened, resulting in the P wave falling outside the PVARP and identified correctly as atrial sense (AS), making ventricular tracking of the atrial signal possible with a ratio of 1:1. Upper tracking rate limit was reset higher as well. (c) EGM 12 weeks after procedure. TWOs disappeared.

Left bundle branch pacing (LBBP) has recently emerged as an innovative approach to correct CLBBB. According to the accordant experiences from several centers, it is a promising way of cardiac resynchronization therapy (Zou et al.2018; Strauss et al.2011; Huang et al.2019; Zhang et al.2019). In this case, LBBP was successfully performed and the paced QRS morphology presented a selective LBBP pattern under threshold output, which suggested that the pacing site was beyond the blocked area and succeeded in the capture of LBB (Chen et al.2019). The widened QRS complex due to CLBBB became fully normalized with fusion of the RBB conduction by adjusting the sensed atrial ventricular delay (SAVD). The electro‐synchrony brought along a super‐respondence of CRT in this patient. However, TWOs were found during follow‐up, which in turn led to a decrease in pacing ratio during ventricular tracking mode and affected the efficacy of CRT therapy. From the ECG shown in Figure3a, we can notice three different patterns of QRS complexes: narrow, intermediate, and widened. The optimal narrow QRS complex (first, fourth and seventh) was the result of successful LBBP, but the following TWO resulted in the pacemaker reaching its upper tracking rate limit and triggered the prolongation of SAVD, which in turn led to an intermediate fusion beat formed by the merging of intrinsic and paced QRS (second, fifth, and eighth). Moreover, the following TWO reset the PVARP, causing the next intrinsic atrial signal to fall into this period and fail to trigger ventricular pacing, which led to the widened baseline CLBBB QRS morphology (third and sixth).

The T‐wave over‐sensing in this case was caused by T‐wave inversion (TWI) during LBBP, which has been observed and reported previously by Geng et al. (2022), and was probably the result of cardiac memory (CM). The idea is that, after the cessation of abnormal ventricular depolarization, the changes in myocardial repolarization can be manifested by a change in the T‐wave axis, also known as electrotonic modulation of the T wave, as a result of the restoration of normal cardiac excitation and the subsequent changes in ventricular repolarizing sequence (Rosenbaum et al.1982; Walton et al.2013). Rosenbaum et al. proposed in 1982 that the T waves during normally conducted beats seemed in some way “to remember” the QRS complex of the abnormally conducted beats and showed the same direction as these abnormal QRS complexes, and named this effect ‘cardiac memory’. They confirmed with experiments in their article that the occurrence of left bundle branch block may produce deeply negative T waves (TWIs) during subsequent normalization of conduction, and that this effect exhibits a cumulative nature (the longer LBBB lasted, the longer it took for the TWIs to return back to normal) (Rosenbaum et al.1982). Detailed mechanism of this phenomenon is still unknown, but has been explored in various animal heart models regarding action potential duration heterogeneity and endogenous ventricular gradients (Walton et al.2013; Blair et al.2025). In summary, successful LBBP can alter the ventricular activation sequence of LBBB cases back to normal, resulting in transient and reversible TWIs that may persist for days or even weeks with said mechanism.

Furthermore, despite the fact that the occurrence of prominent T‐wave changes might be the main reason for TWOs, in this case TWOs did not occur immediately after the procedure when TWIs already existed. Hyperkalemia caused by renal failure and side effects of certain medication might be responsible for the high and sharp T‐wave morphology and therefore precipitated the malfunction in this patient, for the sharp T waves with higher amplitude would be more easily identified as R wave by the CRT‐D.

Also, the unique algorithm of ICD might have played a role in this situation as well. With the auto sensing algorithm of ICD, it is more probable for TWOs to happen with the lower sensitivity threshold after ventricular pacing (Brown and Swerdlow2016). The changing of sensitivity threshold after sensing and pacing also made it more susceptible for CRT‐D to identify the T wave as the R wave.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that describes electrotonic modulation‐related T‐wave over‐sensing after LBBP. The present case suggested that LBBP was capable of correcting the true CLBBB and normalizing the QRS complex completely. However, this significant change in ventricular repolarization sequence could precipitate T‐wave changes in the early phase after pacemaker implantation, which might induce TWOs and interfere with the operation of CRT‐D. This problem can be solved by reprogramming the parameters of the pacemaker. In this case, T‐wave changes improved as time went by, and this problem no longer existed according to our observation. Nevertheless, the phenomenon of electrotonic modulation‐related T‐wave changes after LBBP should receive more attention in future clinical practice.

Augmented reality (AR) allows the real environment to be altered with superimposed graphics using a head-mounted-display (HMD), smartphone or tablet. AR in surgery is being explored as a potential disruptive technology and could be used to improve patient understanding of treatment and as an adjunct for surgery. The aim was to explore this use of AR and assess potential benefits for consent and patient education. A systematic review was conducted using PRISMA-SCR guidelines. 4 major bibliographic databases were searched using the terms: ‘(augmented reality OR mixed reality) AND surgery AND (consent OR patient education)’. Included papers evaluated an AR intervention on consenting patients for enhancing surgical consent or education about a procedure. Non-English language papers and studies which did evaluate an intervention were excluded. Three reviewers screened all abstracts and full text papers for inclusion. The review protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (ID: CRD42020207360). 52 records were identified. Following removal of 13 duplicates, 21 were removed after abstract screening leaving 17 articles for full assessment. One article was a letter and 8 did not evaluate interventions, leaving 8 articles published between 2019 and 2023. 3 papers were randomised controlled trials comparing AR enhanced processes to standard consent, 2 cohort studies evaluated patient satisfaction with AR interventions and there was one randomised crossover trial of AR against traditional consent consultation. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used most studies were deemed as high risk of bias. Patient satisfaction and understanding were improved using AR. However, advantages over other enhanced techniques are less clear. Using AR to enhance written literature was shown to require less mental effort from patients and was preferred to standard resources to understand complex surgery. The few randomised trials are limited by bias and lack of power calculation, highlighting the need for further research.

This study used a robust evidence search to identify and synthesise key applications of augmented reality (AR) in the field of surgery. Augmented reality is a technique where graphics can be superimposed onto models or a real environment. Papers that attempted to improve patients’ understanding of surgical procedures and/ or better communicate risk of surgery using AR were included in the final review. There were 8 papers that met the criteria for our review published between 2000 and 2023 included in the review that examined interventions in a range of surgical specialties and used different study types. Most of the articles reported a benefit to using AR including better mental comprehension of complex concepts, visualisation of anatomical structures and better understanding of what a certain operation involves. Some of the studies included were prone to bias, specifically ‘novel technology’ bias whereby the benefits are likely over-stated by participants. We concluded that AR could improve patients’ understanding of difficult concepts which are important to convey during the surgical consent process. Higher quality evidence is needed in this field and it unclear to what extent AR can provide benefits over less expensive models and moving images.

Augmented reality (AR) is an evolving technology which allows three-dimensional computer-generated graphics to be superimposed onto physical objects in the real environment via the use of a viewing device [1]. Another term given to this technology is ‘mixed reality’ or ‘virtual environments’, which are perceived to be the future for innovation in a range of consumer, industrial and scientific settings [2]. The development of AR for use in surgery is in its infancy, however it is clear there may be potential benefits to its use for many aspects of surgical and clinical practice [3].

There are key differences between AR and virtual reality (VR). VR sees the user fully engaged in a virtual environment [4] and gives a ‘perception’ of being in this environment [2]. AR incorporates computer-generated elements with the real environment and physical objects, creating a fusion or blending of the real world and virtual elements [4]. A fundamental concept of AR is that of ‘registration’, this is how the real-world objects spatially connect to the superimposed data or graphics [5].This is typically done with a ‘reference frame’, which is a fixed point the computer uses to reference throughout the activity. Newer generation AR systems are finding ways to effectively remove the need for a reference marker.

There are four key components to an AR system: a computer, tablet or smartphone; a software graphics rendering package; a viewing device or electronic display – this may be a smartphone with camera or head-mounted display (HMD), usually an AR headset or smart-glasses – and a reference frame (physical object to track or mounted QR code, for example) [6]. There are a number of commercially available AR headsets, including Hololens by Microsoft, Google Glass by Google and Magic Leap 1 by Magic Leap.

There is also recognition of the need for quality input data to allow for the most accurate and clinically appropriate translation of data into AR for use in surgery [6]. Consideration of the limitations of AR in the early aspects of its use means there is a feeling that routine, commonplace use of AR in surgery is still a way off [7].

Uses for AR can be considered from both patient and clinician perspectives [4]. Its use can be divided into pre-operative, intra-operative and post-operative stages of the patient pathway, as well as its role in training surgeons and wider medical education [8,9]. Pre-operative uses include patient-specific surgical planning [10], patient education and use as a tool for visualisation and understanding of the procedure for consent [11]. Intra-operatively, potential roles for AR include visualisation of pre-operative imaging, fluoroscopy, navigation of complex anatomy and implant positioning [12]. Post-operative uses include rapid access to patient diagnostics, laboratory results, integration of further investigation results and vital signs in real time [13].

Uses for AR in training include rehearsal of operative or procedural steps and stages, remote assistance/guidance and immersive teaching programs [5,9]. There is also the role for AR in improving understanding of how to correct deformities or problems intraoperatively [5] and immersive learning of important and relevant anatomy [14]. It is not unrealistic to view AR in surgery as a potential ‘disruptive technology’, with Moroet al.[14] recognising adverse effects for users of AR and the need for additional personnel in technical setup/aspects of AR use in surgery [10]. However, as with all new techniques and technologies in surgery, each role must be robustly evaluated with high quality clinical research methods to assess benefits and drawbacks. There is currently no classification system for applications of AR in surgery.

One of the limitations of AR is the need for a physical reference marker to ensure intra-operative patient movement does not impact on the accuracy of the system. Marker-less systems have yet to prove as reliable and their use is currently limited even within pre-clinical research [5]. Another issue is accommodation and focusing conflict with HMDs, creating a useable overlay depth of field is important to ensure minimal visual strain when using AR systems intra-operatively, with headaches and blurred vision cited as recognised adverse effects for HMD users [14]. Furthermore, the HMD must be designed carefully to prevent problems with sterile field contamination, user fatigue and strain whilst allowing the surgeon to perform the procedure or task in the real environment with minimal interference when necessary. HMDs are the preferred AR devices in intra-operative applications due to their minimal invasion of the operative field and other user factors.

In the UK the cost of clinical negligence and impact of surgical complications is vast [15] and this is a potential area where AR use could be implemented. Several surgical specialties have examined AR’s potential benefits and limitations in assisting the surgical consent process. In the current medicolegal landscape, it is important clinicians find new ways to assist patients in making decisions around surgery and maximise the informed nature of the consent process [16].

The aim of this paper is to systematically analyse the literature for published work examining the role of AR in the surgical consent and patient education process, highlight potential benefits and limitations of this and identify areas for further work and future research.

A search strategy was designed around PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews [17]. This was PROSPERO registered in line with criteria for inclusion of systematic reviews (PROSPERO registration ID CRD42020207360). The use of AR for surgical consent is a novel area and a meta-analysis was not planned due to a likely paucity of evidence.

A literature search was performed of Medline, PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar bibliographic databases using the following search terms ‘(augmented reality OR mixed reality) AND surgery AND (consent OR patient education)’.

These terms were chosen to yield maximal results and identify papers that focused on the use of AR to improve patient understanding of complex concepts or procedures. Results were limited to papers published after the year 2000 in English language (or translated to English). The aim of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of AR in consenting surgical patients and patient education interventions. Included papers evaluated an AR intervention on consenting patients for enhancing surgical consent or education about a procedure. Non-English language papers and studies which did evaluate an intervention were excluded.

All references were exported with their abstracts to a word processing document for each database searched. All abstracts and full text articles were screened independently by the reviewers (TDS, TE and GGJ). A fourth reviewer (AT) was used to adjudicate for any disagreements. Full text articles were read for each included study after abstract screening and reference lists for each were analysed for potential further studies to be included via abstract screening of relevant papers.Fig 1outlines the systematic scoping methodology in line with PRISMA techniques. The original search was conducted in April 2020 with a further search in August 2020 to incorporate latest results. A further search was conducted with the same search terms in February 2023 on account of the paucity of available literature found in the initial search period. The same search criteria and methods were used in this additional round of searches.



The search yielded fifty-two results, of which 13 were removed due to duplication. A further 21 did not cover the inclusion criteria on review of the abstract. 8 papers were included following full text review by both authors (Fig 1).

One of the full text papers was ultimately excluded due to being a published commentary style letter and another eight were excluded as they did not evaluate an intervention. Each paper included in the final study is summarised and discussed below and inFig 2.



All included studies were published between 2019 and 2023. Two studies examined use of AR in urology [18,19], one study focussed on trauma and orthopaedics [20], two studies were in plastic and reconstructive surgery [21,22] and three studies were in neurosurgery [23,24,25]. The three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) identified [18,23,24] and the single randomised crossover trial are assessed for risk of bias below using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB-2) by consensus between two reviewers. Participant level variables were not extracted in this largely narrative analysis. Owing to heterogeneity between studies and highly variable experimental designs a narrative synthesis was chosen.

In neurosurgery for refractory epilepsy, Houseet al. [23] evaluated a commercially available software package combined with Microsoft Hololens. This was shown to significantly improve patient comprehension and imagining (ability for a patient to imagine the steps involved in such an operation) and relieve anxiety before surgery. This seventeen patient study compared standard verbal consent with imaging review to use of plastic brain model and patient-specific AR brain model with superimposed MRI and CT scans [23]. The authors conclude that AR consent made surgery significantly more comprehensible and imaginable than standard consent processes and aided a reduction of pre-operative patient anxiety. Limitations of this study include risk of bias due to the ‘new technology effect’, low sample size and limitations establishing how much information was retained by patients. There was also a possibility of unrealistic expectations of the simplicity and ease of completing the procedure by viewing animations on the HMD. Interestingly, the same study did not show a statistically significant increase in comprehension, imagining or reduction in anxiety for patients’ relatives. Three of the authors of this manuscript declare conflicts of interest as advisor, chief executive office and employee of the parent company of the software solution tested.

Wakeet al.[18] assessed patients undergoing surgery for renal and prostate cancer. Patients were consented with imaging alone, 3D printed patient-specific models, 3D models viewed with AR (Microsoft Hololens) or the same model viewed on a standard computer monitor. This randomised study of 200 patients showed 3D printed models performed significantly better than imaging alone for patients’ understanding of their disease and surgical treatment plan. The paper found 3D models performed significantly better than AR models for improving patients’ understanding of anatomy, disease process and comfort level with treatment plan. However, detailed analysis of arms of the trial revealed that only 25 patients were randomised to the AR group compared with 55 and 46 in the 3D printed and 3D model on computer groups. No detail was provided on the randomisation technique. The authors followed up with a systematic review examining the role of 3D printing and AR for patients with urological cancer concluding that these technologies could have an increasing role in the management of these patients [19]. Aside from their own data on AR discussed above, they found no further studies examining AR specifically for pre-operative patient education.

In trauma and orthopaedic surgery, Connaghanet al.[20] evaluated a bespoke AR application –‘I X-RAY’– a tablet-based AR application to improve children’s and parents’ understanding of a common paediatric orthopaedic injury, a distal radius torus fracture. This injury is commonly managed in a removable splint without the need for specialist follow up and provision of high-quality information and reassurance is crucial. The application uses AR to overlay graphics onto the child’s arm to demonstrate their injury and show them how the bone is likely to heal whilst explaining their treatment and recovery plan. Sixty-six fully completed questionnaires from children between the ages of 5 and 15 years who used ‘i X-RAY’ were included. 74% of children stated their understanding of the injury and recovery process was improved after using the AR app. 89% of children and their families agreed or strongly agreed this technology should be used more in school and hospital environments. Unfortunately, this study was not randomised and tested in a healthy trial group but does show promise for the use of AR technology.

Lo and Chapman [21] reported a global first using an AR enhanced patient information leaflet for reconstructive surgery using an anterolateral thigh flap following sarcoma resection. Patients use a smartphone app to scan photographs on the leaflet which ‘come to life’ with videos and further information. The AR leaflet was found to require significantly less mental effort to comprehend (1.57 vs 6.36 on Mental Effort Rating Scale) than traditional resources. 86% of the fourteen patients in the study stated they felt less anxious about surgery after using the AR intervention with all respondents feeling similar leaflets would be beneficial for patients and that further AR enhanced leaflets should be developed. This highlights patient support for similar resources and the potential accessibility of AR supported patient education and consent by using the patient’s own smartphone, reducing the high setup costs associated with VMDs yet retaining the benefits brought by AR in improving patient understanding of treatment and surgical procedures.

Loet al.[22] further evaluated the benefits of AR enhanced patient leaflets for parents of children undergoing cleft lip or palate procedures. They similarly found that the role of AR saw significant improvements in multiple domains when compared to traditional patient leaflets. An AR enhanced leaflet was used in a randomised crossover trial as a pilot study for further trials on the use of AR in patient consent or education. The trial showed less mental effort required to understand resources when scrutinised on the Mental Effort Rating Scale (2.00 for AR leaflet vs 4.75 for traditional methods), which was the primary outcome measure of the trial pilot. There was significantly improved visual analogue scale (VAS) for AR leaflet (93.50) than traditional methods (54.50) and recognition that AR enhanced leaflets are more useful for patients than conventional leaflet types (Usefulness Scale for Patient Information Material scores of 74.08 compared to 49.42). Furthermore, the Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IIMS) result suggested improved motivation for choosing to proceed with surgical intervention after the use of AR enhanced leaflet when compared to traditional patient leaflets (161.75 compared to 112.50).

Leeet al.[25] similarly ran a pilot study comparing neurosurgical patient understanding of procedures before and after an AR intervention involving a 360-degree virtual surgical theatre session with a neurosurgeon. Understanding of procedures was improved in all patients included in the pilot (19 patients strongly agreed, 5 patients agreed on intervention questionnaire) and there were reported levels of both improved understanding of procedures – 9.3 vs 6.8 on questionnaire scale of 1-10 of understanding of procedure. 95.8% patients felt their inclusion in decision making was improved as a result.

The use of two different 3D imaging AR platforms (Surgical Theater™ in group 1 and Vesalius™ in group 2) prior to craniotomy was favourable in improving understanding of both pathology and the surgical process when compared to the traditional use of 2D imaging in the pre-operative consent process in the SPLICE (Surgical Planning and Informed Consent) study by Perinet al.[24]. Their three-armed trial showed that whilst there was a similar subjective level of understanding of the surgical process (88.33; 89.76; 89.09 on ad-hoc questionnaire scale), objectively there was significant improvement in comprehension of diagnosis, therapeutic alternatives, tumour and intervention type in the AR enhanced arms of the trial compared to the control group, with scores of 92.73 for both AR arms and 67.57 in the control group on a pre-designed multiple-choice question test given after the consultation. Interestingly, Perinet al. [24] did not see any meaningful difference in the levels of pre-procedure anxiety across the trial groups.

As previously mentioned, there was a significant risk of bias in the three RCTs included in this systematic review.Fig 3demonstrates the extent of these risks using the Cochrane risk of bias toolkit (RoB-2).



The intervention trials included following the systematic literature search were found to have high risk of bias or some concern of bias risk. Neither Houseet al.[23] or Wakeet al.[18] included power calculations in their methodology and the Houseet al. [23] study may have been conflicted by commercial interest. It was also likely to have been significantly underpowered. Overall, the risk of bias in these papers was significant. Perinet al.’s[24] SPLICE study was slightly more robust in its methodology and returned some concern of bias when calculated through the RoB-2 toolkit. Loet al.’s [22] randomised crossover study was also analysed for risk of bias and showed low risk of bias according to the calculations. However, it is worth pointing out that this was a pilot study with a small study group and so the significance of this low-risk status must be taken in the context of these details.

Overall, the nature of the trials analysed in this review means that a true blinding process is very difficult. By analysing the effects of AR in consent and education processes, being able to conceal the arm of the trial each participant is in would realistically be impossible. However, small sample sizes and other external risks mean that the potential risk of bias for the studies is nonetheless still high.

Literature reports of applications of augmented reality in this field should describe the development of the product and involve patient or carer reported measures of effectiveness and include a comparator group where possible as well as mental effort scores to assess the ease of understanding. This could follow healthcare technology assessment methodology. Simpler and cheaper uses of AR are likely to be easier to deploy in healthcare systems where hardware purchasing can be prohibitive. Applications could be classified according to level of fidelity from simple enhanced written materials viewed using a smartphone through to high-fidelity smart glasses programmes for patients. Classification could improve searchability of reports and provide a common language similar to that for medical simulation.

The use of AR in patient education and surgical consenting process is a poorly studied application of the technology and there is little high-quality evidence available to analyse. The trials which have attempted to randomise patients to standard and AR enhanced consent pathways for surgery give conflicting conclusions to the value of AR for patient education and there are issues surrounding risks of bias and/or conflict of interest. Further randomised controlled trials are required in this area and would ultimately answer the question of how this technology could enhance and improve the surgical consent process for patients. Whilst the authors of this systematic review are confident the literature search strategy was carefully constructed to yield maximum relevant results, it is possible some records in grey literature or conference proceedings were not detected and given the rapidly evolving nature of technology in surgery there is a real possibility that more current literature has since been published.

There are few published studies demonstrating the use of AR for surgical consent and patient education processes and most of the evidence is descriptive and experimental in nature. Grouped analyses of the current literature is not possible. Studies detailed in this paper where AR consent interventions are evaluated are limited by small sample sizes, unequal subgroup allocation and selection bias. Despite this, patients in almost all the studies preferred an AR enhanced consent or information programme compared to standard or traditional resources hence proving a foundation for these technologies [20,21,23,25].

There is certainly potential for the use of AR in improving surgical patient education and it is likely, especially in children, that using this technology could improve engagement and potentially aid retention of more information about their condition and the full scope of treatment [20]. Barriers to the technology in a clinical setting have not been fully explored nor has the ability of elderly patient groups to engage with AR. Surgical practice encompasses patients of all ages and it is important the needs of all patient groups are considered with any new intervention. There may be particular value in utilising AR to help explain concepts that cannot be easily relayed to patients with simple 2D imaging or where particularly complex elements are being explained [20,21,23].

There is currently a lack of well-designed RCTs within the literature to evaluate AR in the surgical consent and patient education process. The benefits of AR over other technologies such as 3D printed models and 3D models viewed on computers or portable devices must be carefully assessed [19]. Power calculations assessing interventions are needed and more robust efforts to control the effect of performance and detection bias are required. The expensive nature of AR and emerging technologies means a strong evidence base needs to be established before routinely utilising AR software packages and hardware in publicly funded healthcare systems to ensure good value for money and reasonable use and distribution of valuable resources. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) – a topical and similarly emerging technology- to enhance written information and patient communications is another potential solution that could improve patient education whilst delivering value for money [21].

Overall, the evidence presented suggests patients tend to prefer information regarding their condition and surgery using AR enhanced resources and their understanding may be improved as a result. This paper provides a foundation for the ongoing work in the area and support for further related research.

Most studies showed AR increased patients’ understanding of their disease process and proposed treatments above standard discussion and imaging review

AR may be of most value for complex procedures or where there are complex decisions regarding treatment options

Further high-quality and carefully designed trials would help assess benefits of AR for this specific use

Studies on accessibility and ease of use of AR technology for different patient demographics are required

AR enhanced patient information leaflets are a low-cost intervention which may deliver the added benefits of AR by using patients’ own smartphones or tablets

During running, it is difficult to control breast motion and change torso motion or vice versa within empirical data collection. This study investigated how different levels of breast support (and consequently breast motion) influence torso motion, breast forces, lumbar and thoracic spinal moments during running, using a computer simulation model. A subject‐specific female full body musculoskeletal model with an articulated thoracolumbar spine and sliding joints between the breasts and torso to enable breast motion was customised for this study. One female (bra size 34DD) had 59 markers attached to anatomical locations and ran over three force platforms at a self‐selected speed (3.15–3.40 m/s) in three breast support conditions (no bra, everyday bra and sports bra). An ‘extreme’ bra condition was simulated during the modelling process by eliminating all breast motion relative to the torso. Two categories of simulations were run, investigating 1) how different breast support garments affect torso motion, breast and spinal moments; and 2) how changes in torso motion affect breast and spinal moments. Key findings suggest that peak lumbar and thoracic spine moments demonstrate changes (> 0.05 Nm/kg) between bra conditions due to changes in running gait kinematics. Additionally, eliminating breast motion relative to the torso, but using the same input running gait kinematics, increased (> 0.05 Nm/kg) lumbar joint moments. Therefore, it is possible that bras aimed at preventing relative motion between the torso and breasts may increase internal loading within the spine.

A customised subject‐specific female musculoskeletal model was capable of providing a first approximation of changes in spinal moments following simulated changes in breast motion during running.

Reducing the magnitude of breast motion relative to the torso (∼0.03 m) in this participant, via a more supportive sports bra, caused a reduced torso flexion angle (∼4°) and an increase in peak extension (∼0.15 Nm/kg) spinal joint moments.

Simulating a theoretical bra product that could eliminate all breast motion relative to the torso (100% bounce reduction), but uses identical experimental gait kinematics increased (0.04 to 0.10 Nm/kg) peak lumbar extension moments.

Improvements in bra design that aim to maximise bounce reduction may increase internal loading on the spine and hence possible back pain during running.

Due to their lack of intrinsic support during dynamic activity, breasts deform (McGhee and Steele2020; Risius et al.2015) and move relative to the torso (Mills et al.2014). Breast support garments, such as bras, provide additional extrinsic support to reduce breast movement and subsequently minimise exercise‐induced breast pain (J. White et al.2015). In both research and commercial activity, bras are commonly categorised as high support, which usually refers to sports bras, or lower support, which can refer to everyday/fashion bras (McGhee et al.2013; J. L. White et al.2009). All bras afford different amounts of breast motion reduction depending upon their design and construction (Wang et al.2017).

Many bra manufacturers place emphasis within their marketing on ‘bounce reduction’ with greater reductions in breast motion indicating improvements in design and bra performance (Bunchanan and Joshi2023; Oluban2023). Although reducing breast motion has been shown to reduce breast pain (Brown et al.2014; McGhee and Steele2020), it may be that bra designs with greater breast motion reduction have an ‘unseen’ consequence on the musculoskeletal system. Soft tissue motion within other parts of the body, such as the thigh or shank, has been reported as an important factor in reducing internal joint loading (Pain and Challis2006; Gittoes et al.2006). The magnitude of soft tissue motion of the breasts may alter the joint moments within the spine, and hence reducing soft tissue breast motion (improved bounce reduction within a bra) may in fact increase spinal moments.

Spinal loading plays an important role in back pain (Actis et al.2018) and a difference of 0.05 Nm/kg in lumbar spine moments has been reported between male participants with and without back pain (Hasegawa et al.2018). Postural changes at the thoracic spine, due to potentially heavy loads from the breasts on the anterior chest, have also been a proposed causal mechanism for nonspecific back pain (McGhee et al.2018). Nonspecific back pain has been reported to be greatest in the lumbar and thoracic regions, with breast support garments that reduce the nipple‐to‐sternal notch distance relieving nonspecific back pain (Haworth et al.2023). Finally, Leme et al. (2020) stated that if the appropriate breast support is not used, women may perform adaptations throughout the body to relieve the discomfort of breast movement when not supported. This suggests that the magnitude of breast support afforded by bras may be linked to changes in vertebrae alignment, and hence potentially changes in spinal moments of greater than 0.05 Nm/kg may provide an indication of increased risk of potential back pain (Hasegawa et al.2018).

The musculoskeletal modelling approach has been utilised to understand how occupational load carriage tasks alter spinal load (Kim and Zhang2017) and to estimate internal spinal loading, providing an insight into the underpinning mechanism causing back pain. However, previous female musculoskeletal models have either incorporated breast mass within the torso segment or as fixed segments on the anterior of the torso (Morino and Takahashi2017), neglecting relative motion between the torso and breasts.

As previous research reported that soft tissue motion reduced internal joint loading, it is hypothesised that increases in breast motion relative to the torso will decrease the internal loading within the spine, during an activity like running. However, the magnitude of breast motion may also affect torso motion (Fong et al.2022), leading to adjustments in torso or full body mechanics to compensate for changes in forces elsewhere. During running, it is difficult to control breast motion and change torso motion or vice versa within empirical data collection; however, this novel application of computer modelling provides a unique way to assess breast motion changes and their effects on torso motion and spine moments.

Therefore, this study aims to investigate how breast motion changes effect torso motion, breast forces and lumbar and thoracic spinal joint moments. Subsequently, two objectives were created: Objective 1, to understand how different simulated breast support garments (sports bra, everyday bra and no bra) affect torso motion, breast and spinal joint moments during running. Objective 2, to simulate a bra with 100% bounce reduction to understand how completely constraining breast motion relative to the torso, when running, would change breast forces and spinal joint moments.

Following institutional ethical approval, one female (74.6 kg, 1.79 m, 26 years, UK bra size 34DD) provided written informed consent to participate. One participant was recruited for this study and one trial in each condition used, similar to previous modelling research (Mills et al.2008; Pain and Challis2006; Masters and Challis2022), as the purpose of this paper was to understand the underpinning mechanics of how simulated breast movement reduction effects the spine rather than the variability of an individual's performance. A customised marker set of 57 reflective markers was attached to anatomical locations (Figure1), with a handheld ultrasound machine (Sonosite Edge, USA) used to guide spine marker placement. One additional marker was placed on each nipple (over the bra, where appropriate). Three force platforms (9281E, Kistler, Switzerland; 1000 Hz) and a 19‐camera motion capture system (Qualisys, Sweden; 250 Hz) were synchronised for data collection. Left and right breast boundaries were identified using the folding line method (H. Lee et al.2004) and the most superior, inferior, medial and lateral boundary positions marked using a surgical pen for breast volume and mass estimation. The participant completed a running trial in three bra conditions: bare breasted (no bra; NB), wearing a nonpadded, underwired everyday bra (EB) (Marks & Spencer; made from 88% Polyamide and 22% elastane Lycra) and a sports bra (SB) (Triumph, Triaction; made from 30% polyamid, 25% elastan, 25% cotton, 20% polyester) and had their bra size assessed by a trained bra fitter using the best‐fit criteria (J. White and Scurr2012). The participant stood statically for 15 s while a handheld 3D surface scanner (Artec Eva) recorded torso and breast geometry in each bra condition to estimate breast volume, mass and centre of mass location. Following a gentle warm‐up and familiarisation, the participant stood statically for 5 s and then performed separate running trials at a self‐selected speed (3.15–3.40 m/s), in each bra condition (to maximise ecological validity), while kinematic and kinetic data were collected.



Customised marker locations on participants. Lumbar spine markers located at L1, L3 and L5 and thoracic markers located at T1, T3, T5, T7, T9 and T11.

Surface breast scans were processed in Artec Studio 17 Professional (Artec3D, Luxembourg) using the marked breast boundary in the no‐bra condition. Each breast was extracted from the torso and the posterior of the breast was flat filled and the volume calculated using the software. Breast mass was estimated using the breast volume and breast density of 945 kg/m3(Sanchez et al.2017), giving a mass of 0.747 kg (right) and 0.754 kg (left). Second, for each bra condition (no bra, everyday bra, sports bra), the breast centre of the mass position was calculated using the static breast 3D surface scan and assuming each breast was a geometric solid hemisphere (Haddox et al.2020). The centre of mass was calculated usingY= 3 R/8, where ‘Y’ was the distance to the centre of mass and ‘R’ was the radius of the hemisphere. The radius was calculated from the nipple marker (breast apex) to the breast boundary. The centre of mass was at a distance Y anteriorly from the breast base towards the breast apex. A virtual breast centre of the mass marker was created in all static and dynamic trials within the Qualisys Track Manager software. All kinematic and kinetic data were processed and exported via a customised MATLAB script for importing into OpenSim (Simtk.org).

A validated female full‐body model (Burkhart et al.2020) with a fully articulated thoracolumbar spine (T1 through L5) and 3 rotational degrees of freedom at each intervertebral joint was selected for customisation for this study. The female model was modified to include two breast segments positioned on the anterior of the torso. Previous literature has defined the motion of the breast in three dimensions (Scurr et al.2011); therefore, each breast segment was represented by a point mass and attached via a three degrees‐of‐freedom sliding joint to the torso allowing the translation of the breast segment relative to the torso segment in three planes (anterior/posterior, medial/lateral and superior/inferior). This is a tracking‐based (data‐driven) inverse dynamics solution and the viscoelastic behaviour of the breast tissue is inherently included in the experimental kinematic data. The initial position of each breast segment was defined by the centre of the mass position of the breast during standing. The standard OpenSim workflow (Akhavanfar et al.2022) was followed to ensure the generic female model (Burkhart et al.2020), scaled to the participant based on marker data from the static trial (model to experimental marker RMS < 1 cm, maximum error < 2 cm) and was within recommended thresholds (Hicks2019). The breasts were not included in the scaling process and their mass was included within the torso segment. After successful completion of the scaling process, the mass of each breast was subtracted from the sum of the lumbar and thoracic spine, ribs, sternum, clavicular and abdominal segment (torso) masses (24.04 kg) and added to the relevant breast segment; therefore, the whole‐body mass remained unchanged. The Inverse Kinematics Tool, in OpenSim, was used to find the values for the generalised coordinates (joint angles and positions) in the model that best matched the experimental kinematics using a weighted least squares approach, whose solution aimed to minimise both marker and coordinate errors. The resulting kinematics were filtered with a low pass Butterworth filter and a cut‐off frequency of 5 Hz (Rácz and Kiss2021). Subsequently, the inverse kinematics solutions were combined with the ground reaction force data within the Inverse Dynamics Tool for each bra condition in order to calculate the spinal joint moments during the running trials. This protocol enabled us to understand how different bras affect torso motion and spinal moments (Objective 1).

To address Objective 2, a hypothetical bra condition (extreme bra) was created with the breast segments locked in their static trial position within the OpenSim software. The inverse dynamics were re‐run using the running gait kinematics from the other bra conditions (no bra, everyday bra and sports bra). This simulated an ‘extreme’ sports bra condition in which all relative motion between the breast and torso segments was eliminated (100% bounce reduction). This allowed any changes in running gait kinematics caused by previous bra conditions to be examined independently of the breast support provided by the bra for the participant in this study.

The local coordinate system for the torso was defined by markers on the sternal notch, xiphoid process, seventh cervical vertebra and eighth thoracic vertebra (Wu et al.2005) and used to calculate torso flexion/extension, lateral bend and axial rotation within the global coordinate system for each breast support condition. Nipple markers were used to calculate the range of motion relative to the torso segment (Mills et al.2016) during the gait cycle of each breast support condition to ensure the selected trial was indicative of typical published nipple motion data (Mills et al.2016; J. L. White et al.2009; Scurr et al.2010) and hence suitable for subsequent comparison between breast support conditions. The nipple range of motion (No bra = 0.057 m superior‐inferior (SI); 0.034 m mediolateral (ML); 0.035 m anterior‐posterior (AP). Everyday bra = 0.022 m (SI); 0.014 m (ML); 0.008 m (AP). Sports bra = 0.022 m (SI); 0.008 m (ML); 0.004 (AP)). Subsequently, the breast centre of the mass position and breast joint force (the force applied by the breasts on the torso at the sliding joint) was calculated in the torso local coordinate system in three directions (anterior‐posterior, medial‐lateral and superior‐inferior). For each bra condition, the net joint moment of each lumbar (L1–L5) and thoracic spine joints (T1–T12) were averaged to give single lumbar and thoracic moment values at each time point (Raabe and Chaudhari2016). Time histories were normalised and key events within the gait cycle were identified using the vertical ground reaction forces (threshold > 10 N). All spinal joint moment data were normalised to the participant's mass (74.6 kg).

The participant's self‐selected horizontal velocity was 3.40 m/s in no bra, 3.27 m/s in the everyday bra and 3.14 m/s in the sports bra. The torso remained in flexion throughout the trials (∼11° range of motion), with symmetrical axial rotation and slightly greater (∼4°) left bend of the torso (Figure2). Figure2suggests that for the participant in this study, the bra condition affected the orientation of the torso, with a more upright torso position in the sports bra condition. However, the bra condition did not alter the torso range of motion during the running gait cycle.

The greatest range of motion of the breast centre of mass (∼0.052 m) occurred during no‐bra running in the superior‐inferior direction (Figure3). Following decreases in the breast centre of mass motion, the magnitude of peak breast joint force also decreased (up to 4 N) between bra conditions. There were small changes in the timing of peak breast joint forces (Figure3). Peak lumbar and thoracic spine moments showed differences (> 0.05 Nm/kg) between bra conditions in most planes (Table1), with a trend of increased lumbar extensor moments with increased breast support.

Despite relative breast motion being zero, a force is still applied at the breast joints during running. There were minimal changes (∼2 N) in peak breast joint force between the three bra gait kinematics when breast motion was zero (Figure4). A phase delay of ∼10% of the gait cycle was apparent for breast joint force in the medial‐lateral direction within the sports bra and everyday bra running gait kinematics compared to the no bra.

Constraining breast motion to zero (extreme bra) caused peak lumbar and thoracic spine moments to change by more than 0.05 Nm/kg, depending on input gait kinematics (e.g., gait kinematics from the no bra, everyday bra or sports bra trials) (Table2). The greatest magnitude of joint moments occurred during lumbar extension, with a 0.09 Nm/kg (7%) increase, to 1.36 Nm/kg, in extensor moments when running with no bra compared to sports bra gait kinematics. However, the greatest change was seen in the gait kinematics from the everyday bra trial reducing clockwise loading by 32% (0.36 Nm/kg reduction) compared to the no‐bra gait kinematics; furthermore, there was a 0.28‐Nm/kg (32%) reduction in the right bending from no‐bra to sport bra gait kinematics.

When examining lumbar joint moment time histories in the extreme bra trial, there were minimal differences in lateral bending; axial rotation showed both increases and decreases in lumbar moments time histories when compared to their corresponding gait kinematics (Figure5). However, extension lumbar joint moments tended to be greater in the extreme bra conditions and the no‐bra gait kinematics exceeded 0.05 Nm/kg (Figure5). When examining the thoracic joint moment time histories, the magnitudes were lower than the lumbar spine (Figures5and6); however, similar patterns to the lumbar spine were evident with some joint moments exceeding 0.05 Nm/kg in the extreme bra when compared to their corresponding gait kinematics.

This study used a subject‐specific female musculoskeletal model to investigate how different bras influence torso motion, breast joint forces and lumbar and thoracic spinal moments during running. Key findings suggest that reducing the magnitude of breast motion relative to the torso (∼0.03 m), via a more supportive sports bra, is associated with a reduction in the torso flexion angle (∼4°) and an increase in peak extension (∼0.15 Nm/kg) spinal joint moments, compared to running in no bra, for the participant modelled in this study. Furthermore, when simulating an ‘extreme’ bra that eliminated breast motion relative to the torso, but used identical experimental gait kinematics from each bra condition, the ‘extreme’ bra condition increased (0.04 to 0.10 Nm/kg) peak lumbar extension moments. Although the bra industry may strive towards maximising bounce reduction, this novel method of modelling breast motion relative to the torso has demonstrated that achieving 100% bounce reduction will not enable any energy dissipation and hence may increase internal loading on the spine and possible risk of back pain.

The female musculoskeletal computer model developed for this study enabled the authors to understand how different breast support garments (bras) affected torso motion, breast joint forces and spinal moments. The breast support conditions (no bra, everyday bra and sports bra) were associated with changes in the self‐selected horizontal running velocity, the magnitude and timing of breast centre of mass position, torso motion and breast joint forces during running for the participant and trials in this study. The self‐selected horizontal running velocity was 0.26 m/s lower in the sports bra compared to the no‐bra condition. Furthermore, the greatest breast range of motion occurred within the no‐bra condition and in the superior‐inferior direction, similar to previous studies (Scurr et al.2010). Both the sports bra and everyday bra attenuated superior‐inferior breast motion similarly; however, the sports bra lifted the breast more superiorly relative to the torso (by ∼0.01 m). The sports bra was more successful at reducing breast motion in other directions than the everyday bra when compared with no bra. A different horizontal running velocity in each bra condition may have contributed to the reduction in the magnitude of torso flexion by ∼4° in the sports bra compared to the no bra, suggesting a slower but more upright running technique. The torso range of motion remained similar across bra conditions.

The force applied by the breasts on the torso at the sliding joint (breast joint force) also reflected similar changes to the breast motion, supporting previous evidence that a combination of design features and viscoelastic properties of the fabric materials used can alter breast motion (Zhou et al.2013; C.‐w. Lee et al.2022). Finally, peak lumbar and thoracic spine moments showed (> 0.05 Nm/kg) differences between bra conditions, possibly indicating a change in the potential for the participant to experience back pain (Hasegawa et al.2018). Running in no bra changed the gait kinematics, reduced peak lumbar extensor moments, increased peak right bending and clockwise rotation moments compared to the sports bra condition. Furthermore, running in no bra increased left and right bending moments and clockwise and anticlockwise rotation moments within the thoracic region when compared to the sports bra condition. Thus, running while wearing a sports bra may increase the risk of lumbar back pain (indicated by an increased extension moment > 0.05 Nm/kg; Hasegawa et al.2018), but it may also help reduce thoracic back pain. The results associated with Objective 1 suggest that the ‘level’ of breast support (i.e., amount of breast movement reduction relative to the torso) does impact the magnitude of breast force, torso position and lumbar and thoracic spinal moments for the participant in this study.

The bra industry increasingly markets ‘bounce reduction’ or reduction in relative breast motion as a measure of bra performance. The extreme bra condition was created to simulate a theoretical product that could eliminate all relative breast motion while maintaining gait kinematics from the other experimental bra conditions (Objective 2). The results suggest that the change in gait kinematics associated with the different bra conditions (no bra, everyday bra and sports bra) has a similar impact on the magnitude of spinal moments as the breast motion reduction afforded by the bras. For example, the difference in peak lumbar extension moments between bra conditions was 0.15 Nm/kg; however, the difference due to the extreme bra (while maintaining matched bra gait kinematics) was 0.09 Nm/kg. Therefore, if the participant in this study ran with the gait kinematics observed in the sports bra trial while wearing a hypothetically more supportive ‘extreme’ bra, the limited energy dissipation would likely lead to increased spinal loading, particularly in flexion, extension, and right bending. It is suggested that the participant in this study may have used a compensatory mechanism whereby gait kinematics were altered as breast kinematics changed due to the bra condition in order to maintain a similar level of spinal moments. This, in combination with theoretical mechanics, suggests that bra industries that strive for greater bounce reduction in their products may need to consider the ‘unseen’ consequence on the musculoskeletal system such as compensatory mechanisms or changes in spinal loading.

This study offers a unique new insight into the effect of breast support on spinal moments using a musculoskeletal modelling approach, conflicting with the common assumption that breast movement reduction is always a positive outcome in sports bra design. Although this study investigated three bra conditions and a further simulated ‘extreme’ bra condition, future research could look to find the optimal combination of breast motion and timing (bounce reduction) that minimises spinal loading to inform future bra design. Biomechanical or engineering‐related modelling research that utilises females could benefit from including moveable breast segments into models to ensure improved realism of female torso characteristics that could impact equipment design or estimating of internal loading within female injury risk prediction.

Although the results of this study demonstrate differences in spinal moments between simulated changes in breast motion, the limitations associated with this modelling approach are important to discuss. The actual data presented may vary given the individual single subject nature of the model and single trial approach used, and thus aspects such as the self‐selected individual gait kinematics of participants in different bras may influence whole body kinematics (Taylor M et al.2020; Fong et al.2022) and the exact spinal moments reported; however, the general principles can be inferred (Yeadon and Pain2023). The proposed threshold of 0.05 Nm/kg (Hasegawa et al.2018) as an indicator of possible changes in back pain must be considered given this was reported for male participants and the lumbar spine. Therefore, although this may provide an indicator, any conclusion regarding bras and back pain must be considered with caution and could be investigated in future work with symptomatic patients while standing, walking and running. The breast kinematics were captured using a marker placed on the bra; although careful bra fit criteria were followed (J. White and Scurr2012), it may be possible for relative motion between the breast tissue and bra to occur, altering the magnitude of actual breast motion. This tracking‐based (data‐driven) inverse dynamics solution incorporated the basic gross level viscoelastic behaviour of the breast tissue inherently in the experimental kinematic data; however, a future forward dynamics model would enable the manipulation of viscoelastic soft tissue properties to determine how they affect soft tissue motion. Finally, although this model did not account for musculature and the resulting muscle contraction forces on spinal joint compression and shear, the model utilised the same input gait kinematics to provide an initial insight into the underpinning mechanisms of how changes in breast motion could affect spinal moments during running.

Although caution must be applied when interpreting the magnitude of differences in spinal moments between the simulated changes in breast motion, there is evidence to suggest that an individualised subject‐specific female musculoskeletal model was capable of providing a first approximation of changes in spinal moments following simulated changes in breast motion. Furthermore, it is possible that a bra that achieves 100% bounce reduction may increase extensor loading within the spine.

These macroinvertebrates may play a key role in the Anopheles population's bioregulation in aquatic habitats and malaria control. There are few studies characterizing macroinvertebrate predators and other macroinvertebrates coexisting with Anopheles larvae in Burkina Faso. This study aimed at characterizing and evaluating the different interactions between anopheline mosquito larvae, predatory macroinvertebrates, and other co-habitants in aquatic habitats in the three climatic zones of Burkina Faso.<h4>Methods</h4>A larval survey was performed in the three climatic zones of Burkina Faso (Sahelian, Soudano-Sahelian, and Soudanian zones) from September to November 2022. Mosquito larvae and other macroinvertebrates were sampled using standard dippers or bucket, preserved in Falcon tubes containing 80% ethanol, and transported to the laboratory for morphological identification. Alpha diversity analysis was used to measure macroinvertebrate diversity according to climatic zones and correlation matrix analysis was performed to determine the different interactions between Anopheles and other macroinvertebrates in breeding sites.<h4>Results</h4>In the studied larval habitats, Anopheles were found with several aquatic macroinvertebrate predators and other cohabiting macroinvertebrates. The abundance and alpha diversity indices of macroinvertebrate predators and other coexisting macroinvertebrates varied significantly according to climatic zone (P = 0.01). Correlation analyses showed that in the Sahelian zone, Anopheles spp., Corixidae, and Notonectidae shared the same aquatic habitats. In the Soudano-Sahelian zone, Anopheles spp. occupied the same larval habitats with Belostomatidae, Notonectidae, and Achatinidae, and in the Soudanian zone, their presence in larval habitats was correlated with that of Beatidae.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study showed a significant trophic association between Anopheles and predatory and other coexisting macroinvertebrates in larval habitats in Burkina Faso.

In Nepal, deeply rooted socio-cultural norms, economic disparities, and patriarchal values greatly impact women's access to educational opportunities, particularly in the field of medicine. Although there has been an increase in female enrollment in medical programs, pervasive biases, gendered expectations, and informal cultural scripts-often referred to as the ""hidden curriculum""-continue to influence their aspirations, specialty choices, and professional journeys. Understanding these dynamics is vital for ensuring women's full engagement in the medical workforce.<h4>Methods</h4>This qualitative study employed semi-structured interviews with fifteen final-year female undergraduate medical students at a private medical college in Bharatpur, Nepal. Thematic analysis was employed to identify and interpret the key themes.<h4>Results</h4>Five key themes emerged: (1) The Marriage Mandate: Negotiating Family, Tradition, and Professional Aspirations; (2) The Gendered Clinic: Unveiling Bias in Medical Education and Practice; (3) Investing in Daughters, Expecting Returns: The Gendered Economics of Medical Education; (4) Transnational Aspirations: Negotiating Mobility, Marriage, and Medical Careers and (5) Claiming Space: Agency, Resistance, and Redefining Success in the Medical Profession.<h4>Discussion</h4>The pervasive ""hidden curriculum"" of gendered barriers persists despite policy efforts, constitutional safeguards, and increasing female representation in medical schools. These challenges, if unaddressed, risk perpetuating a cycle of underutilizing women's talents, limiting the diversity of the healthcare workforce, and hindering progress toward achieving equitable health outcomes. The findings underscore the urgent need for gender-transformative approaches that acknowledge and actively dismantle these deeply rooted biases at institutional, community, and policy levels. These approaches should focus on creating supportive structures that empower women to fully contribute to the medical profession.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Female medical graduates encounter significant obstacles, including entrenched patriarchal norms, systemic inequalities, and a pervasive ""hidden curriculum"" of biases.

Achieving gender equality in education is crucial for promoting social equity, driving economic growth, and improving overall population health. In Nepal, deeply rooted socio-cultural norms, economic disparities, and patriarchal values greatly impact women’s access to educational opportunities, particularly in the field of medicine. Although there has been an increase in female enrollment in medical programs, pervasive biases, gendered expectations, and informal cultural scripts—often referred to as the “hidden curriculum”—continue to influence their aspirations, specialty choices, and professional journeys. Understanding these dynamics is vital for ensuring women’s full engagement in the medical workforce.

This qualitative study employed semi-structured interviews with fifteen final-year female undergraduate medical students at a private medical college in Bharatpur, Nepal. Thematic analysis was employed to identify and interpret the key themes.

Five key themes emerged: (1) The Marriage Mandate: Negotiating Family, Tradition, and Professional Aspirations; (2) The Gendered Clinic: Unveiling Bias in Medical Education and Practice; (3) Investing in Daughters, Expecting Returns: The Gendered Economics of Medical Education; (4) Transnational Aspirations: Negotiating Mobility, Marriage, and Medical Careers and (5) Claiming Space: Agency, Resistance, and Redefining Success in the Medical Profession.

The pervasive “hidden curriculum” of gendered barriers persists despite policy efforts, constitutional safeguards, and increasing female representation in medical schools. These challenges, if unaddressed, risk perpetuating a cycle of underutilizing women’s talents, limiting the diversity of the healthcare workforce, and hindering progress toward achieving equitable health outcomes. The findings underscore the urgent need for gender-transformative approaches that acknowledge and actively dismantle these deeply rooted biases at institutional, community, and policy levels. These approaches should focus on creating supportive structures that empower women to fully contribute to the medical profession.

Female medical graduates encounter significant obstacles, including entrenched patriarchal norms, systemic inequalities, and a pervasive “hidden curriculum” of biases. However, they demonstrate remarkable resilience and determination in challenging stereotypes, redefining success, and reimaging their professional identities. Their experiences align with global efforts toward gender parity in education and employment. Equitable representation of women in the medical workforce is not only a moral imperative but also a strategic necessity for advancing public health, strengthening healthcare systems, and promoting social justice.

Gender equality in education is foundational for advancing global equity, strengthening public health, and achieving sustainable development goals. Extensive research has established that improving girls’ and women’s access to quality education yields long-term benefits for families, communities, and entire nations, enhancing their agency and economic prospects [1–3]. However, despite these recognized benefits, significant disparities persist. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) data from 2023 indicate that over 122 million girls worldwide remain out of school [4], representing a substantial obstacle to global progress. Investments in women’s education have been linked to increased earnings, reduced poverty, and improved health outcomes [5,6]. For example, a World Bank study demonstrated that increasing the share of women with secondary education by just 1% point can boost annual per capita income growth [7]. Furthermore, research has shown strong correlations between maternal education and child health, with children born to mothers with secondary education experiencing significantly reduced mortality in early childhood [8]. Beyond these quantifiable benefits, educated women tend to exercise greater decision-making power within households and foster democratic participation [9–11]. This interconnectedness underscores that gender parity in education is not merely a human rights issue but a strategic imperative for achieving inclusive economic growth, improved health, and sustainable social development.

Addressing gender disparities in education assumes even greater significance in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where limited resources, fragile infrastructures, and entrenched social hierarchies exacerbate existing inequalities, hindering progress towards the broader goals of gender equality. In these settings, educational inequities not only reflect but also drive broader structural vulnerabilities, limiting the capacity of individuals and communities to break intergenerational cycles of hardship [12,13]. While primary school enrollment has improved in many LMICs, significant gender gaps persist, particularly in secondary and tertiary education, disproportionately curtailing women’s socioeconomic mobility and civic engagement [14]. Socio-cultural norms frequently prioritize boys’ education [15], relegating girls to domestic responsibilities and early marriage, a practice that continues to affect a substantial number of girls in LMICs [16]. These practices not only interrupt their educational trajectories but also erode human capital and negatively impact national development and public health outcomes [17]. These factors create formidable barriers for women seeking to enter and succeed in higher education, especially in demanding medical fields, where extended training and professional development are essential [18].

The urgency of addressing educational inequities in LMICs is further compounded by socioeconomic vulnerabilities and infrastructural deficiencies that disproportionately affect girls and women. Economic hardship often exacerbates gender-biased household resource allocation, prioritizing boys for limited educational resources (e.g., school fees, materials, transportation) due to perceived greater potential for future financial returns [19]. Inadequate educational infrastructure, particularly the scarcity of safe and gender-sensitive learning environments, further compounds these challenges. The lack of essential amenities, such as secure sanitation facilities and menstrual hygiene resources [20], coupled with the risk of gender-based violence in and around educational institutions [21], negatively impacts girls’ motivation, attendance, and academic performance, creating significant obstacles to their progression into higher education [20]. Consequently, achieving gender equality in education within LMICs is not merely an aspirational goal; it constitutes a crucial intervention that can transform social structures, enhance human capital, and establish a foundation for more equitable and resilient health systems.

While these pervasive challenges significantly impede girls’ access to and completion of basic education, the pursuit of gender equality in education extends beyond mere access. Even when women overcome these initial barriers and attain higher education, persistent societal pressures related to marriage, childbirth, and familial responsibilities continue to significantly shape their career trajectories [22,23]. From early education through postgraduate training and beyond, women encounter societal expectations and norms prioritizing family obligations over professional ambitions, leading to compromised career progression, interruptions, or even complete abandonment [24]. This phenomenon warrants scrutiny, reflecting deeply ingrained societal values undermining women’s professional development and limiting their contributions to the healthcare workforce [25]. Existing research underscores the difficulties women face in balancing familial expectations with career aspirations [26,27]. This issue is particularly evident in the South Asian context. For example, in Pakistan, women constitute a significant majority (80%) of medical college enrollments. Yet, a substantial proportion (50%) of graduated female doctors either do not enter practice or leave the workforce shortly after starting, according to the Pakistan Medical Council (PMC) [28]. In Pakistan, this loss of trained female physicians is a major contributor to the country’s overall doctor shortage. This example highlights how societal pressures can prevent women from fully realizing their professional potential in medicine. This highlights the critical need for supportive structures and policies that enable women to pursue their professional goals in medicine without sacrificing personal fulfillment or succumbing to these intense societal pressures.

In the Nepalese context, the interplay of socio-cultural norms and economic constraints creates a complex landscape for women’s educational and professional development, particularly within the medical field [29]. Nepal, classified as a lower-middle-income country in 2020 with a gross national income (GNI) per capita of $1,090 [30], faces considerable challenges in delivering adequate healthcare to its population [31]. While Nepal has made progress in improving women’s status [32], persistent patriarchal values and traditional kinship structures continue to shape expectations that confine women’s roles to the domestic sphere [32,33]. These expectations can limit schooling opportunities for girls [34] and contribute to poorer health outcomes, as evidenced by research linking lower educational attainment to adverse reproductive health outcomes [35]. In this context, women’s educational disenfranchisement in Nepal cannot be separated from broader questions of economic justice and cultural transformation—both of which are integral to fostering a healthier, more equitable society.

Building upon this understanding of the broader socio-cultural and economic context in Nepal, it is crucial to examine the specific challenges faced by women within the medical profession. While an increase in female enrollment in medical programs in Nepal, exemplified by the 61.56% enrollment of women in the academic year 2018/19 [36], indicates progress, quantitative gains alone are insufficient due to the ongoing underrepresentation of women in the Nepalese medical workforce despite this rise in female medical student enrollment. Currently, women represent only 25% of Nepal’s generalist medical practitioners’ workforce [37]. A “hidden curriculum” of tacit values, behavioral norms, and institutional biases persists, directing female trainees away from high-prestige specialties and leadership positions while reinforcing traditional caregiving roles [38]. These implicit forces shape students’ clinical competencies [39], attitudes, and professional identities [40], ultimately influencing the caliber and diversity of future healthcare delivery [38,41]. These challenges are compounded by economic disparities [42,43] and uneven enforcement of gender equality policies [44], leading to persistent gender-based discrimination and harassment within academic and clinical settings [45,46]. Taken together, these findings call for attention to the urgent need for a more transformative approach—one that not only broadens female participation in medical education but dismantles the entrenched cultural, economic, and institutional impediments that still stand in the way of equitable professional attainment and meaningful healthcare contributions by women.

Building upon the established context of pervasive gender inequities in Nepal, this study explores the challenges female medical graduates face as they transition into the medical profession. Focusing on their lived experiences, this research examines the interplay of gendered expectations, implicit biases, and structural inequalities embedded within their educational and clinical environments. It aims to illuminate the subtle yet powerful forces that shape their professional identities and influence their future roles as healthcare providers. Specifically, this study addresses the following research question: How do female medical graduates in Nepal perceive, navigate, and respond to the “hidden curriculum” of gendered norms and biases throughout their medical education, and how do these experiences shape their specialty choices, career paths, and contributions to the medical workforce?

This study employed a qualitative methodology, explicitly utilizing a narrative inquiry approach [47]. This design was selected as it is well-suited for exploring the lived experiences and personal stories of individuals, aligning directly with the study’s central aim: to understand how final-year female medical students in Nepal perceive, interpret, navigate, and make meaning of the gendered ‘hidden curriculum’ throughout their education and as they anticipate their career trajectories. Ontologically, narrative inquiry in this context adheres to a constructivist paradigm [48], acknowledging that individuals’ realities are subjective, socially constructed, and deeply embedded within their specific socio-cultural context. Epistemologically, it recognizes that knowledge is co-constructed through the interaction between the researcher and participant, emerging from the interpretation of the narratives shared [49].

Adopting narrative inquiry facilitates an in-depth exploration of the temporal and contextual dimensions of the participants’ journeys through medical education [50]. This allows for the capturing of complex sequences of events, the personal meanings ascribed to pivotal moments such as encountering bias or making career decisions, and the ways participants story their past experiences, present realities, and future aspirations in relation to pervasive gender norms and institutional structures. To ensure methodological rigor and transparency in reporting, the conduct and reporting of this study adhere to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) guidelines [51].

The study was conducted at a tertiary institution located in Bharatpur, a major urban center in Nepal’s Chitwan district. This institution was selected due to its prominent role as a leading provider of tertiary education and its large cohorts of undergraduate medical students, providing a relevant context for exploring the experiences of female medical students in a competitive learning environment.

Participants were recruited using a combination of purposive [52] and convenience sampling strategies [53]. Specifically, purposive sampling was employed to identify individuals who met predefined inclusion criteria designed to capture information-rich perspectives pertinent to the research question. The recruitment then proceeded based on convenience among those eligible within the selected institution. To ensure participants possessed a comprehensive understanding of the clinical environment and its associated challenges, the following inclusion criteria were established: Medical students were eligible if they (1) were enrolled in the final or fifth year of their undergraduate medical degree; (2) had completed at least 80% of their required clinical rotations; and (3) identified as female. This selection strategy aimed to gather perspectives from students with substantial clinical exposure, enabling them to offer rich insights into the factors influencing career progression within the medical field. Focusing on final-year students allowed the study to capture the nuanced perspectives of those nearing the transition from medical education to professional practice. A final sample size of fifteen participants was deemed sufficient for the study’s narrative inquiry approach, guided by the aim of achieving code and thematic saturation through in-depth exploration, focusing on the richness and complexity of experiences rather than statistical generalizability [54].

Data for this study was gathered through individual semi-structured interviews conducted following the COREQ guidelines. Semi-structured interviews were deemed the most appropriate method for data collection because they provide a flexible framework for exploring participants’ experiences and perspectives in depth while also allowing for emergent themes and unexpected insights to be captured [55]. This approach allowed the interviewer to establish rapport with the participants, creating a comfortable and supportive environment for them to share their stories and reflections on their experiences in medical education. No prior relationship existed between the researchers and the participants.

Each interview was conducted at a time and location convenient for the participant, lasting approximately 60 min. The data collection phase spanned from June 2024 to September 2024. A semi-structured interview guide was developed to facilitate a focused yet open-ended exploration of the research topic (see Table1). This guide ensured that key areas of inquiry were covered while allowing flexibility to probe deeper into emerging themes and individual experiences. Recognizing the importance of allowing participants to express themselves authentically, they were given the option to respond in either English or Nepali. While English is the primary language of instruction in medical education, the choice to use their native language allowed for a more nuanced and comfortable expression of their experiences, particularly when discussing sensitive topics related to gender and cultural norms.

Interview questions

The researcher actively engaged with the participants throughout the interviews, employing probing and follow-up questions to elicit detailed and insightful narratives. This interactive approach fostered a deeper understanding of the participants’ perspectives and allowed for clarification and elaboration on key themes. All interviews were audio-recorded with the participant’s explicit consent, ensuring accurate capture of their narratives and facilitating subsequent analysis.

A thematic analysis approach was employed to analyze the qualitative data gathered from the semi-structured interviews. This analysis was structured by the six-phase framework developed by Braun and Clarke [56], providing a systematic and rigorous method for interpreting the rich narratives shared by the participants.

To maintain analytical consistency and mitigate potential researcher bias, the lead author (AG), an academic with expertise in both qualitative research methodologies and clinical education, moderated all interviews and directed the analytical process. Initially, all audio recordings of the interviews were transcribed verbatim. To ensure accuracy and cultural appropriateness, interviews conducted in Nepali were first translated into English by the lead author and subsequently validated by the second author, who possesses fluency in both Nepali and English.

The research team, comprised of academics with extensive experience in qualitative public health research, then engaged in a thorough immersion process, involving multiple readings of the transcribed interviews. This in-depth familiarization with the data facilitated a comprehensive understanding of the participants’ experiences and viewpoints. Subsequently, the team systematically identified and extracted significant textual segments from the transcripts, each representing distinct ideas, experiences, or reflections expressed by the participants. These significant segments were then synthesized to capture their core meaning while retaining their essential content.

An inductive approach to coding was utilized [57], whereby these synthesized segments were assigned descriptive codes derived directly from the data, rather than relying on preconceived categories. A comprehensive codebook was then created to organize these codes into meaningful categories based on shared conceptual attributes. The study aimed for code and thematic saturation, focusing on the depth and richness of themes rather than achieving data saturation [54]. A collaborative approach was implemented to ensure analytical rigor and consensus. Initial coding was performed independently by two researchers, and the codebook underwent iterative refinement through comparative analysis and team discussions. Any disagreements in coding or interpretation were resolved through team consensus meetings, where the relevant data extracts were reviewed, and a shared understanding was established. This iterative cycle of independent coding, comparative analysis, and discussion continued until the research team achieved consensus on the final set of themes and sub-themes.

This meticulous analytical process facilitated the consolidation of initial codes into overarching themes that captured the key patterns and insights present within the data. In the final stage of analysis, a detailed narrative account was developed to present the thematic findings, incorporating illustrative quotations from the participants to provide rich contextual evidence. To further enhance the trustworthiness of the analysis, a peer debriefing process was undertaken. An external expert in qualitative research reviewed the interview transcripts, the research methodology, and the emergent findings, providing valuable critical feedback and identifying potential biases or inconsistencies. The research team revisited the transcripts and audio recordings as needed to ensure the final report faithfully represented the participants’ voices. This comprehensive and collaborative approach to data analysis was designed to ensure the rigor, trustworthiness, and transparency of the findings, establishing a robust foundation for understanding the complex dynamics of gender within medical education and practice in Nepal. The entire data analysis procedure is summarized in Table2.

Data analysis process

To ensure the trustworthiness and rigor of the qualitative data and subsequent analysis, this study adhered to established criteria for qualitative research quality, encompassing credibility, dependability, confirmability, and transferability [58].

Credibility was established through a comprehensive member checking process. This involved actively seeking feedback from participants regarding the accuracy and interpretation of their narratives. Member checking was conducted in two phases. First, during each interview, the moderator (AG) summarized key points and emerging interpretations to allow participants to confirm or challenge their understanding. This ongoing member checking during data collection ensured that the researcher’s interpretations were aligned with the participants’ intended meanings. Second, after the initial thematic analysis, a summary of the key themes and supporting quotes was compiled and emailed to all 15 participants. They were invited to review the summary and provide feedback on the accuracy and resonance of the themes with their experiences. Participants were given two weeks to respond, and any feedback received was carefully considered and incorporated into the final analysis. This iterative process of member checking enhanced the credibility of the findings by ensuring that they accurately reflected the participants’ perspectives.

Dependability was achieved through a meticulous approach to data collection and analysis. The semi-structured interview guide was developed based on a comprehensive literature review and the author’s deep familiarity with the Nepalese context, particularly regarding gender disparities in education and career progression. Furthermore, experts in medical education and qualitative methodology reviewed the interview guide and research protocol to ensure their relevance and rigor. This thorough preparation and expert input contributed to the dependability of the data collection and analysis process.

Confirmability was ensured through transparent and detailed documentation of the analytical process. This included maintaining a detailed audit trail of the research process, including descriptions of how data were summarized, meaning units extracted, condensed, coded, and ultimately synthesized into categories and themes. This meticulous record-keeping allowed an independent auditor to trace the research process and verify the findings, enhancing the confirmability of the study.

Transferability, which pertains to the potential applicability of the findings to other contexts, was supported through detailed descriptions of the study participants, the research setting, and the data collection and analysis process. This comprehensive documentation allows readers to assess the relevance and transferability of the findings to their own settings and situations.

Reflexivity was addressed through the research team’s ongoing critical self-reflection. Recognizing that the researchers’ own positions—specifically, their roles as academics embedded within Nepalese education and health contexts, which provided an ‘insider’ perspective, and their distinct gender identities, with the lead author being male and the second author female—could potentially shape interpretations and introduce biases. Hence, to mitigate this, the researchers maintained reflexive journals throughout the study to document assumptions, preconceptions, and reactions to the data, facilitating critical examination of how their perspectives might influence the research process. Furthermore, the diverse gender composition of the core research team involved in data analysis is considered a strength, fostering a more balanced interpretive lens during discussions. Regular team meetings provided a crucial platform for open dialogue and reflexive discussions, where interpretations were rigorously challenged, compared, and iteratively refined to ensure emerging themes were demonstrably grounded in participant data rather than researchers’ preconceived notions. Additionally, the peer debriefing process with an external qualitative research expert, mentioned previously, served as another vital mechanism to identify and mitigate potential unconscious biases. This multi-faceted commitment to reflexivity aimed to enhance the trustworthiness and transparency of the research process, ensuring the findings authentically represented the participants’ experiences and perspectives.

Ethical clearance was obtained from the Nepal Health Research Council (approval number– 437/2024) and the institutional review board of Chitwan Medical College. Written voluntary informed consent was obtained from each participant, who was assured of their right to withdraw from the study at any time.

This study involved fifteen final-year female medical students from a tertiary institution in Bharatpur, Nepal, aged between 26 and 31 years. Nine participants had entered the medical program directly following high school, while three held prior undergraduate degrees in health sciences. All participants reported medicine as their first-choice career path, expressing a deep passion for healthcare. All fifteen participants reported being unmarried at the time of the interviews; marital status was not an inclusion criterion for the study. Table3provides a detailed overview of the participants’ socio-demographic characteristics. The key themes emerging from the analysis of these participants’ experiences are visually summarized in Fig.1.

Key themes shaping the experiences of female medical students in Nepal

This theme encapsulates the profound influence of societal expectations surrounding marriage and family on the professional aspirations of female medical graduates in Nepal. Participants described navigating a complex landscape where traditional gender roles often clash with their ambitions for a fulfilling medical career. This tension manifests in various ways, ranging from overt familial pressure to subtle societal cues, ultimately impacting their career choices, mental well-being, and sense of self.

Many participants felt torn between fulfilling familial expectations and pursuing their professional ambitions. This internal conflict often stemmed from the deeply ingrained belief within their communities that a woman’s primary role is that of wife and mother.

My parents, like many others in our community, believe that a woman’s ultimate goal is marriage and motherhood. They supported my decision to study medicine, but I sometimes feel it’s seen as a temporary pursuit, something to do before I settle down and start a family. My mother often talks about how proud she’ll be when I’m married to a ‘good man’ and have children. It’s hard because I want to make them proud, but I also have this burning desire to become a skilled surgeon. I dream of specializing in neurosurgery, which requires years of further training and dedication. Sometimes, I worry that my family won’t understand or support that path, especially if it means delaying marriage or having children later in life. I feel caught between their hopes and dreams for me and my own ambitions. (Anya)

Anya’s poignant reflection illustrates the precarious position many female medical students occupy. While their families may support their initial pursuit of medical education, it is often perceived as a precursor to marriage rather than a lifelong career. The pressure to conform to traditional timelines for marriage and childbearing creates a significant burden, particularly for those aspiring to demanding specialties like neurosurgery.

Beyond explicit familial expectations, participants also described experiencing a more subtle yet pervasive form of societal pressure. This “silent pressure” is conveyed through unspoken cues, assumptions, and indirect messages that reinforce the primacy of marriage and family for women.

While no one explicitly tells me to get married and give up my career, the unspoken societal expectation is always there, hanging over my head like a cloud. It’s in the way relatives look at me with pity when I mention my plans for specialization, the questions neighbors ask about when I’ll find a husband, and the assumptions people make about my priorities. Even some of my female classmates, who initially shared my ambitions, are now talking about finding a husband and settling down. It’s a constant reminder that my value as a woman is often tied to my marital status, not my accomplishments as a doctor. It’s frustrating because I’ve worked so hard to get where I am, and I have so much more I want to achieve. (Maya)

Maya’s experience highlights the insidious nature of societal expectations. Even in the absence of direct pronouncements, the constant reminders and subtle cues from family, friends, and the wider community can create a sense of unease and pressure, impacting their self-perception and professional aspirations. This internalized pressure can be particularly damaging, leading to feelings of anxiety, stress, and self-doubt.

Despite these considerable pressures, some participants demonstrated a strong determination to challenge societal norms and pursue their professional goals. These women actively resisted the expectation to prioritize marriage and family, choosing instead to forge their own paths.

I refuse to let societal expectations dictate my future. I’ve seen how women in my family have sacrificed their dreams to fulfill their roles as wives and mothers. I respect their choices, but I want something different for myself. I want to become a skilled doctor, contribute to my community, and make a difference. I’m particularly interested in public health and working to improve maternal and child health in rural areas. I know it won’t be easy, and my family is already pressuring me to get married before I go abroad for further studies. But I’m determined to pursue my dreams, regardless of the challenges and obstacles I may face. By achieving my goals, I can inspire other young women to do the same. (Nisha)

Nisha’s narrative exemplifies the resilience and agency of some female medical students. Her determination to pursue her ambitions, even in the face of familial pressure, underscores a growing shift in attitudes among some women who are actively redefining traditional gender roles. Their pursuit of professional fulfillment inspires other young women and contributes to a gradual but significant change in societal norms.

This theme explores the pervasive gender biases that manifest within medical education and clinical practice, creating a challenging environment for female medical graduates. These biases, operating at both overt and subtle levels, shape opportunities, influence career trajectories, and perpetuate inequalities within the medical profession. The participants’ narratives reveal how these biases are embedded in their training, from clinical rotations to curriculum content and the overall culture of certain specialties.

Participants described experiencing subtle but persistent pressure to conform to gendered expectations regarding specialty choices. This “pigeonholing” often steered them away from high-prestige or traditionally male-dominated specialties and towards those perceived as more “suitable” for women.

During my rotations in cardiology, I was often assigned tasks like taking patient histories and assisting with basic procedures. While my male colleagues were given more opportunities to observe complex surgeries and engage in critical discussions with the consultant. When I expressed my interest in pursuing cardiology, some doctors suggested I consider pediatrics or obstetric/gynecology instead, saying those fields were ‘more suitable’ for women. It felt like my potential was being limited by their preconceived notions about what women should and shouldn’t do in medicine. (Priya)

Priya’s account vividly illustrates how implicit biases can limit women’s career options. The subtle channeling of female students towards certain specialties, often based on outdated stereotypes about women’s capabilities and preferences, restricts their professional development and perpetuates gender segregation within the medical field. This undermines individual aspirations and deprives the profession of diverse perspectives and talents.

Beyond clinical experiences, participants also highlighted the presence of gender biases within the medical curriculum itself. The underrepresentation of female patients in case studies and the tendency to present women’s health as a deviation from the male norm contributes to a skewed understanding of health and disease.

In many of our textbooks, case studies and clinical examples predominantly feature male patients, even when discussing conditions that affect both genders. Women’s health issues are often relegated to specific chapters or presented as variations of the male norm. This reinforces the idea that male physiology is the standard, while female bodies are somehow ‘different’ or ‘exceptional.’ This not only perpetuates stereotypes but also limits our understanding of women’s unique health needs. (Riya)

Riya’s observation points to a critical issue: normalizing male physiology as the standard in medical education. This perpetuates harmful stereotypes and has significant implications for patient care. By neglecting the specificities of women’s health, medical professionals may be less equipped to diagnose and treat female patients effectively, potentially leading to disparities in healthcare outcomes.

Participants also described encountering a “boys’ club” mentality, particularly within surgical specialties. This culture, characterized by exclusionary practices, condescending attitudes, and subtle or overt discrimination, creates a hostile environment for female medical students and doctors.

Surgery is still very much a ‘boys’ club.’ During my surgical rotation, I felt I had to work twice as hard to prove myself. Some of the male surgeons would dismiss my questions or make condescending remarks. I once overheard a senior surgeon say that women are ‘too emotional’ to be good surgeons. It’s disheartening because I know I have the skills and dedication, but I worry that these ingrained biases will hinder my progress. It’s exhausting constantly having to fight for recognition and respect. (Reena)

Reena’s experience highlights the significant challenges women face aspiring to careers in traditionally male-dominated specialties. The “boys’ club” mentality creates a hostile environment, requiring women to constantly prove their competence and resilience. This not only creates undue stress and hinders their professional development but also discourages many talented women from pursuing these fields, further perpetuating gender disparities at higher levels of the medical profession.

This theme explores the complex economic dimensions of female medical education in Nepal, highlighting how familial investment is often intertwined with expectations of social and economic returns, particularly related to marriage and future family support. This creates a unique set of pressures for female medical students, who must navigate their academic and professional pursuits and the weight of familial financial sacrifices and the associated expectations.

For many participants, the financial investment in their medical education represents a significant sacrifice for their families, often involving mortgaging land or taking on substantial debt. While this investment is intended to provide opportunities, it also creates a burden of expectation, with families often anticipating specific social and economic returns.

My parents mortgaged our land and took out loans to pay for my medical education. They have poured all their resources into me, hoping I will become a successful doctor and uplift our family. While I am grateful for their support, I feel immense pressure to fulfill their expectations. They often talk about how my future husband needs to be well-educated and financially secure, someone who can ‘take care’ of me. It’s as if my education is not just an investment in my future but also a means to secure a good marriage and financial stability for the family. (Anjali)

Anjali’s poignant narrative reveals the complex dynamics at play. While families invest in their daughters’ education with hopes for a better future, this investment is often linked to traditional expectations of marriage and financial security. The pressure to find a “good match” and contribute to the family’s economic well-being can weigh heavily on female medical students, adding another layer of complexity to their already demanding academic pursuits.

The obligation to repay familial sacrifices financially and through fulfilling social expectations creates a feeling of “daughter debt” for many participants. This can lead to internal conflicts, particularly when their career aspirations diverge from familial expectations.

I feel a deep sense of obligation to my parents for the sacrifices they have made. They have invested everything in my education, hoping I will have a better life than they did. But sometimes, this feels like a debt I need to repay, not just with financial support but also by fulfilling their expectations of marriage and motherhood. It makes me question my desire to pursue a career in public health, which may not be as lucrative as private practice. I worry that my choices will disappoint them and that I won’t be able to ‘repay’ their investment in the way they expect. (Bina)

Bina’s reflection highlights the moral dilemma faced by many female medical students. The desire to pursue their passions, such as public health, can clash with the perceived need to choose a more financially rewarding career path to repay their families. This internal conflict can significantly impact their career choices and reinforce traditional gender roles.

Despite these pressures, some participants strongly desired to break the cycle of traditional expectations and redefine success on their own terms. They recognize the importance of financial independence and personal fulfillment as key components of their future.

I am grateful for my education and the opportunities it has given me. However, I also recognize that the traditional expectation for daughters to ‘marry well’ and prioritize family over career perpetuates a cycle of inequality. I want to break that cycle. I want to use my education to achieve my own goals and contribute to society. I believe that by pursuing my path and achieving financial independence, I can inspire other young women and show them they have the right to choose their future. (Chanda)

Chanda’s perspective reflects a growing awareness among female medical students of the need to challenge traditional norms. By prioritizing their goals and achieving financial independence, they aim to fulfill their aspirations and inspire other young women to break free from societal constraints and pursue their own paths. This represents a powerful shift towards greater gender equality and empowerment within the Nepalese context.

For many participants, seeking opportunities abroad represents not only a chance for professional advancement but also an opportunity to navigate and, in some cases, escape the constraints of traditional gender roles and societal expectations within their home country. This pursuit of international experience creates a complex interplay between personal ambition, familial expectations, and a desire to contribute to improving healthcare in Nepal.

For some participants, pursuing opportunities abroad offered a sense of liberation from the social and familial pressures they experienced in Nepal. This pursuit of international experience was seen as a way to prioritize their careers and define success on their own terms.

For me, going abroad for further studies isn’t just about advancing my medical career; it’s about gaining independence and escaping the suffocating expectations of my family and society. Here, I feel constantly pressured to get married, settle down, and prioritize family life. However, I can focus solely on my studies and career in the US [United States] without those pressures. It’s a chance to create my own path and define success on my own terms. (Deepa)

Deepa’s powerful statement encapsulates the desire for autonomy and self-determination that motivates some female medical graduates to seek opportunities abroad. The prospect of escaping the “suffocating expectations” of their home environment allows them to prioritize their professional development and pursue their ambitions without the constant pressure to conform to traditional gender roles.

However, pursuing transnational aspirations is not without its challenges. Participants also described the complex negotiations they face with their families, who often have concerns about their well-being and adherence to cultural norms. This creates a delicate balancing act between personal desires and familial obligations.

My family supports my ambitions, but they also worry about me going abroad alone. They want me to get married before I leave, believing it will provide me with stability and support. I understand their concerns, but I also fear that getting married might limit my mobility and flexibility. It’s a delicate balancing act, navigating my personal and professional aspirations while respecting my family’s wishes. I’m hoping to find a way to pursue my dreams without sacrificing my relationships with my loved ones. (Gita)

Gita’s experience highlights the tension between pursuing personal ambitions and maintaining familial harmony. While families may support their daughters’ desire for professional growth, they often express concerns about their safety and well-being abroad, suggesting marriage as a means of ensuring stability. This creates a complex negotiation for female medical graduates, who must navigate these conflicting expectations while striving to achieve their professional goals.

Despite the allure of international opportunities, many participants expressed a strong commitment to returning to Nepal and contributing to the improvement of healthcare within their own communities. They viewed their international experiences as a means of gaining valuable knowledge and skills they could bring back to their home country.

I believe that pursuing further studies abroad will not only broaden my medical knowledge and skills but also expose me to different healthcare systems and approaches. I want to learn from the best in the world and bring those experiences back to Nepal. I envision myself working in rural communities, providing quality healthcare to underserved populations. My international experience will make me a more well-rounded and compassionate doctor, better equipped to address our country’s unique health challenges. (Hema)

Hema’s perspective underscores the potential for “brain gain” rather than “brain drain.” By gaining international experience and expertise, these female medical graduates can be crucial in strengthening the Nepalese healthcare system and addressing health disparities within their communities. Their transnational aspirations are thus not simply about personal advancement but also about contributing to the betterment of their home country.

Participants demonstrated agency through various forms of resistance, from directly challenging discriminatory practices to redefining conventional notions of success and fostering supportive networks among women in medicine. This theme highlights their proactive efforts to create a more equitable and inclusive environment for themselves and future generations of female medical professionals.

Participants described various ways in which they actively challenged the prevailing status quo within their medical education and training. This included voicing their opinions, questioning outdated practices, and advocating for greater gender equality within their institutions.

I refuse to accept the status quo where women are expected to be passive and compliant. I actively voice my opinions in class, challenge outdated practices, and advocate for gender equality within the medical college. I’ve even initiated discussions with faculty about the need for more female representation in leadership positions and a more inclusive curriculum. It’s not always easy, and I sometimes face resistance, but I believe it’s important to speak up and create space for myself and other women in this field. (Ishwari)

Ishwari’s active involvement as a student representative demonstrates a powerful form of resistance. By directly challenging existing norms and advocating for institutional change, she and others like her are working to create a more inclusive and equitable environment for women in medicine. This proactive approach is crucial in dismantling systemic barriers and fostering a culture of gender equality.

Participants also expressed a shift in their understanding of what constitutes success in the medical profession. They challenged the traditional emphasis on career advancement and external recognition, prioritizing instead a more holistic definition of success that encompasses personal well-being and work-life balance.

For a long time, I thought success meant becoming a renowned specialist, working long hours, and sacrificing personal life for my career. But now, I realize that success can be defined in many ways. I want to be a skilled and compassionate doctor, but I also want to have a fulfilling life outside of medicine. I want to have time for my family, pursue my hobbies, and contribute to my community. Achieving a balance between my personal and professional life is essential for my well-being and ultimately makes me a better doctor. (Jyoti)

Jyoti’s reflections highlight a significant shift in perspective. By prioritizing work-life balance and personal fulfillment, these women are redefining success on their own terms. This challenges the traditional, often male-centric, model of professional success that prioritizes career advancement above all else. This redefinition of success is crucial for creating a more sustainable and fulfilling career path for women in medicine.

Recognizing the challenges they face, participants emphasized the importance of creating supportive networks and fostering a sense of solidarity among women in medicine. Mentorship, both formal and informal, played a crucial role in empowering and supporting female medical students and graduates.

I believe it’s crucial for women in medicine to support each other and create a sense of community. I actively mentor younger female students, sharing my experiences and offering guidance. I encourage them to pursue their dreams, challenge stereotypes, and believe in their own abilities. I also connect them with female doctors who can serve as role models and provide further support. By building a strong network of female mentors and allies, we can create a more inclusive and empowering environment for women in medicine. (Kalpana)

Kalpana’s emphasis on mentorship and solidarity highlights the power of collective action. By creating supportive networks and sharing their experiences, women in medicine can empower each other, challenge discriminatory practices, and foster a greater sense of belonging within a traditionally male-dominated field. This sense of community is essential for promoting gender equality and creating a more inclusive and supportive environment for all.

The “marriage mandate,” as articulated by participants, constitutes a formidable social norm in Nepal, prioritizing women’s roles as wives and mothers, often at the expense of their professional ambitions. This finding aligns with broader patterns of gender inequality in education and employment observed across the Global South, where socio-cultural norms frequently impede women’s access to and advancement within higher education and professional spheres [59–61]. While Nepal has witnessed notable progress in the enrollment of female medical students [36], deeply entrenched gender disparities persist within the medical profession. Alarmingly, only 19% of specialist medical practitioners in Nepal are female [37] a stark statistic that underscores the enduring challenges women face in pursuing and sustaining medical careers. The narratives shared by participants illuminate the complex interplay between individual agency, familial dynamics, and pervasive societal pressures. While some participants expressed a resolute determination to defy these expectations and forge their own paths, they also poignantly described the emotional and, at times, financial burdens associated with challenging deeply ingrained traditional norms. This internal conflict reflects the struggles of women globally who grapple with reconciling personal aspirations with familial obligations and societal expectations [62]. Indeed, globally, women dedicate 3.2 times more time than men to unpaid care work—an average of 4 h and 25 min per day [63]. This disproportionate burden of unpaid care work significantly constrains women’s capacity to pursue demanding careers, particularly in fields like medicine, which demand extensive time commitments and unwavering dedication.

The pressure to marry early and prioritize family life has profound implications for women’s career trajectories, particularly within Nepal’s already strained healthcare system. 2021 data from the Government of Nepal, Ministry of Health and Population, reveals that only 57% of births in Nepal are attended by skilled health personnel, and maternal mortality rates remain alarmingly high, especially in rural areas [64]. The perpetuation of the “marriage mandate” can further exacerbate these critical challenges by curtailing the career paths of female doctors, leading to a critical shortage of skilled healthcare providers, particularly in underserved communities where their expertise is most needed. This resonates with findings from Raza et al. [28] in Pakistan, who identified that patriarchal societal structures, including prevalent stereotypes against working women and the prioritization of early marriage, significantly hinder women’s ability to practice medicine. Their research revealed severe work-life conflict among female doctors, who often find themselves caught between socially ingrained gender roles as homemakers and their professional careers [28]. This not only represents a substantial loss of valuable human capital but also perpetuates gender disparities within the medical profession, limiting women’s representation in leadership and decision-making positions and further hindering the development of gender-sensitive healthcare policies.

Therefore, the “marriage mandate” in Nepal constitutes a significant public health concern with far-reaching consequences. By restricting female doctors’ professional development and limiting their career trajectories, this social norm directly undermines national efforts to strengthen the healthcare system and improve critical health outcomes, particularly for women and children. Addressing this deeply rooted issue necessitates a multi-faceted and comprehensive approach. This includes not only challenging prevailing social norms through targeted community-based interventions that focus on shifting attitudes surrounding marriage timing and spousal expectations [65,66] but also implementing national policies that actively incentivize women’s full participation in the health workforce [67]. This integrated strategy, combining social and policy-level interventions, can strengthen health systems, enhance overall population health outcomes, and promote gender equality within the healthcare sector. It is also crucial to acknowledge and address the intersectionality of gender with other social categories, such as caste, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, as these intersecting identities can further compound the challenges faced by women in the medical profession [68]. By bringing attention to the “marriage mandate” and its detrimental impact on female medical graduates, this study contributes significantly to a growing body of literature that underscores the critical need to address gender inequality in both education and employment as a fundamental pathway to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and promoting equitable and improved health outcomes for all [69,70].

The pervasive gender bias embedded within medical education and clinical practice in Nepal reveals a potent “hidden curriculum” that subtly but systematically reinforces stereotypes and constrains the aspirations of female medical students. Participants’ experiences expose a system where gendered expectations and biases permeate multiple facets of their training, ranging from curriculum content and daily clinical interactions to specialty choices and long-term career pathways. These manifestations of gender bias mirror broader global patterns, where medical education and training frameworks have historically been structured around androcentric norms, effectively centering the male body and experience as the default [71,72]. The participants’ accounts of being steered towards “female-friendly” specialties such as pediatrics and obstetrics while being implicitly or explicitly discouraged from pursuing surgery or cardiology powerfully illustrate how deeply ingrained gender stereotypes can shape professional trajectories. This channeling of female medical students into specific specialties, often based on outdated perceptions of what constitutes appropriate roles for women, not only reinforces traditional gender roles but also severely restricts their career options and potential for advancement [73]. Such biases have a demonstrably detrimental impact on women’s professional development, contributing significantly to their persistent underrepresentation in leadership positions within the medical field. Despite women comprising 67.2% of the global health workforce, they hold a mere 25% of senior leadership roles, according to 2021 data from the World Health Organization (WHO), highlighting the pervasive vertical segregation that continues to plague the health sector [74].

Participants’ observations regarding the lack of inclusivity within medical curricula further underscore the urgent need for systemic reform. The persistent use of textbooks and case studies that predominantly feature male patients, even when addressing conditions that affect both genders, perpetuates the problematic notion of male physiology as the standard, effectively rendering female bodies as deviations or exceptions. Recent research has demonstrated that gender-insensitive curricula can lead to significant diagnostic gaps, delays in treatment, and demonstrably poorer health outcomes for women [75].

Furthermore, the experiences shared by the participants highlight the “boys’ club” mentality that can prevail in certain specialties, creating a hostile environment for female medical students and doctors. The constant need to prove their competence, the frequent experience of dismissive comments and microaggressions, and the struggle to overcome ingrained biases can negatively impact their well-being and professional development. This resonates strongly with research conducted by Lyubarova et al. [76], which found that female physicians were more likely to experience gender discrimination and sexual harassment, contributing to burnout, dissatisfaction, and attrition from the profession. Such workplace cultures directly impede the achievement of gender-equitable progress in the health sector and limit the pipeline of women who can serve as role models and mentors to younger cohorts, thereby perpetuating a vicious cycle of underrepresentation [77]. The implications of these findings extend beyond the individual experiences of female medical students. When medical professionals are trained within a system that systematically reinforces stereotypes and biases, it inevitably affects their clinical decision-making processes. It contributes to demonstrable disparities in the quality of care provided to patients. For instance, research has consistently shown that women are significantly less likely to receive adequate pain management compared to men and are also more likely to be misdiagnosed with certain medical conditions [78].

Beyond the clinical sphere, the gendered economics of medical education play a significant role in perpetuating gender inequality. The participants’ descriptions of “investing in daughters, expecting returns” underscore how daughters’ medical training is frequently viewed as a family strategy that, while facilitating upward mobility, remains tethered to traditional gender norms. While families often make significant sacrifices to support their daughters’ medical education, these investments are often accompanied by expectations of social and economic returns, primarily through marriage and adherence to prescribed gender roles. These dynamic parallels broader patterns observed in the LMICs, where families perceive their daughters’ educational achievements to enhance their “marriageability,” reinforcing patriarchal structures that ultimately constrain women’s autonomy [79,80].

The narratives shared by the participants illustrate the weight of these expectations. Many expressed a profound sense of obligation to fulfill their families’ hopes, feeling pressured to prioritize marriage and family life over their professional aspirations. Such pressures can manifest as “daughter debt,” a form of moral indebtedness that compels young women to align their career choices with familial and societal demands rather than their personal interests. While increased female enrollment in higher education can offer new professional avenues, entrenched gender norms frequently prevent women from translating educational attainment into long-term career advancement [22]. In the Nepalese context, where many families grapple with limited resources, substantial investments in a daughter’s training, often including loans or mortgaging land, intensify the expectation of reciprocal returns. This scenario creates a dual bind: women face not only the societal imperative to marry and stabilize family honor but also the economic imperative to justify the family’s financial sacrifices. Such constraints narrow their professional horizons, compelling them to choose "" appropriate "" pathways for women or forego certain specialties altogether. This phenomenon is not unique to Nepal as research in both LMICs and high-income countries (HICs) indicates that women often shoulder unequal caregiving burdens and experience career interruptions that hinder their advancement in science and medicine [81,82]. Thus, while contextual factors differ, the underlying pattern—where economic considerations intersect with gendered social norms—remains distressingly common across diverse settings. Therefore, when women are denied the full scope of their professional aspirations due to familial or societal pressures, the healthcare system loses valuable human capital and expertise. A 2024 report from WHO underscores the importance of leveraging the entire talent pool of trained health professionals to improve access to quality care, reduce health inequities, and enhance health system resilience [83].

While resilient health systems depend on numerous factors often beyond individual control, participants’ narratives demonstrated personal defiance against traditional expectations and a determination to forge their own paths within the medical profession. Their accounts resonate with feminist theories of agency and resistance, which emphasize the capacity of marginalized groups to contest and reshape social structures that perpetuate inequality [84]. The participants’ accounts of resisting the status quo, advocating for gender equality, and mentoring younger female students reflect a commitment to fostering a more inclusive and equitable medical environment. This collective endeavor aligns with global movements in academic medicine addressing entrenched gender disparities and seeking diversified leadership. Studies indicate that despite increased female participation in medicine, gender gaps persist in senior positions, research funding, and professional recognition [85,86]. By rejecting restrictive frameworks that have historically defined professional advancement, these women align with a broader international community of female health professionals working to dismantle systemic biases and reshape institutional cultures.

Participants explored how transnational mobility can offer liberation and expanded opportunities but also necessitates careful negotiation of familial expectations, cultural norms, and personal desires. For some, pursuing further studies or medical practice abroad represents an escape from Nepal’s “marriage mandate” and societal pressures. This opportunity to focus solely on their careers, free from expectations of early marriage and family life, can be empowering. Research confirms that women who migrate for education and professional development often gain enhanced social capital, broader professional networks, and improved negotiating power within familial and community contexts [87,88]. However, pursuing transnational opportunities presents complexities. Participants expressed concerns about navigating familial expectations and maintaining relationships while abroad. The desire to respect family wishes and maintain cultural ties creates a delicate balance as they reconcile personal and professional aspirations. This tension is compounded by persistent gendered norms that frame women’s mobility as contingent upon marriage or kinship, where female migrants’ trajectories are often shaped by normative assumptions regarding their roles in reproductive labor and caregiving [89,90].

The pursuit of transnational medical careers is also influenced by structural factors, including global demand for healthcare professionals and unequal distribution of resources and opportunities between HICs and LMICs. The “brain drain” phenomenon, where highly skilled professionals migrate seeking better opportunities, can significantly impact public health in source countries like Nepal [91]. The outflow of health professionals from lower-resource settings exacerbates workforce shortages, undermines health system resilience, and delays progress toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) [92]. These global imbalances raise ethical questions about the responsibilities of medical professionals trained in low and middle-income countries and the need for policies that support sustainable healthcare workforce development [93]. However, while “brain drain” is often framed negatively, research on diaspora engagement and return migration suggests more nuanced outcomes. Studies document how returning health professionals bring valuable technical skills, global perspectives, and expanded professional networks that can enhance local healthcare systems [94,95]. This transnational circulation of expertise can foster medical innovation, improve service quality, and address inequalities in healthcare access [96].

However, focusing solely on individual agency and internal networks has limitations. Without systemic reforms, these efforts risk reinforcing a model where women are expected to compensate for institutional shortcomings through personal perseverance and adaptability. Organizational interventions—including transparent promotion criteria, gender-sensitive policies, and structural accountability measures—are necessary to dismantle deeply embedded biases and create equitable career pathways [97,98]. By advocating for broader policy reforms and institutional transformations, these women and their allies can shift the responsibility for change from individuals to the systems that shape professional opportunities, ensuring that their resilience, innovation, and leadership are met with tangible, enduring progress.

While providing valuable insights into the gendered experiences of female medical students in Nepal, this study has several limitations that suggest important avenues for future research. The qualitative, single-institution design in a relatively urbanized region of Nepal limits the generalizability of findings to the country’s diverse educational and sociocultural landscapes. Future research should employ comparative studies across public and private institutions, rural and urban settings, and diverse linguistic, ethnic, and caste groups to capture a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges and aspirations of female medical students nationwide. Furthermore, the focus on final-year students provides a temporally limited perspective. Longitudinal studies tracking participants throughout their medical education and into their professional careers are needed to examine the evolving influence of the “hidden curriculum” and the long-term impact of institutional reforms. While this study acknowledged the intersectionality of gender with other social identities, future research should explicitly investigate the complex interplay of these intersecting identities (e.g., caste, socioeconomic status, ethnicity) and their influence on access to opportunities and career trajectories. Finally, future comparative research across different LMICs would determine whether the findings reflect Nepal-specific norms or broader global patterns of gender inequality in medical education. Future research should also explore the perspectives of male medical students and gender-nonconforming learners to provide a more nuanced understanding of gender dynamics in medical education. Investigating the perspectives of faculty, administrators, and policymakers could elucidate the institutional mechanisms that perpetuate gender inequalities and inform targeted interventions. Moreover, longitudinal studies tracking female doctors’ career progression and its impact on health system performance indicators would provide valuable insights. Finally, expanding the scope to include other health professions would offer a more holistic view of gender dynamics within the healthcare workforce.

This study reveals the intricate barriers faced by female medical graduates in Nepal as they navigate entrenched patriarchal norms and systemic inequalities within their professional aspirations. Despite these constraints, their narratives demonstrate remarkable resilience and a determination to challenge traditional expectations, redefine success, and forge new professional identities. These findings resonate with global efforts to achieve gender parity in education and employment, emphasizing that equitable representation in the medical workforce is a strategic necessity for advancing public health and social justice.

Based on these findings, we recommend the following actionable strategies to promote gender equity in the Nepalese medical field:

Implement Gender-Transformative Medical Curricula: Move beyond simply integrating women’s health content. Implement curricula that actively deconstruct gender stereotypes, address implicit bias, and promote critical reflection on gender dynamics in healthcare. This includes incorporating intersectional perspectives and training faculty in gender-sensitive pedagogy and assessment methods, focusing on actively changing mindsets.

Establish Institutional Gender Equity Offices: Create dedicated offices within medical institutions with the mandate and resources to monitor, investigate, and address gender bias and discrimination. These offices should be empowered to implement transparent policies, provide confidential reporting mechanisms, and conduct regular gender audits of institutional practices related to recruitment, promotion, and leadership.

Develop Targeted Leadership and Mentorship Programs: Implement structured leadership development programs specifically designed for female medical professionals. These programs should provide training in critical skills like negotiation and strategic planning, while also facilitating access to influential mentors and sponsors to accelerate women’s advancement into leadership roles.

Mandate and Monitor Gender Quotas in Leadership: To promote equitable representation in decision-making processes, it is essential to build upon Nepal’s constitutional commitments and existing principles of affirmative action. For example, the allocation of 33% of the budget for scholarships aimed at women [99] could be expanded to include a similar representation quota for women in all leadership and senior positions within medical colleges, hospitals, and health governance bodies. This structural intervention is crucial for accelerating gender parity and enriching perspectives within health governance.

Implement Targeted Financial Support and Incentives: To alleviate the financial burdens identified and incentivize service in underserved areas, establish targeted financial mechanisms for female medical graduates, including needs-based scholarships, tuition waivers, and debt relief or loan forgiveness programs conditional upon a commitment to practice in designated rural or high-need communities for a specified period. This addresses economic barriers and supports the distribution of the health workforce.

Promote Family-Friendly Policies and Support Systems: Implement and enforce policies that support work-life balance for all medical professionals, including flexible work arrangements, accessible childcare, and adequate parental leave. Couple these policies with initiatives challenging traditional gender roles in caregiving to create a more supportive environment for women in medicine.

These recommendations aim to shift from simply acknowledging inequities to actively transforming the structural and cultural conditions that perpetuate them. Empowering women within the medical profession will not only enrich the workforce but also enhance healthcare quality, responsiveness, and equity, contributing to a more just, healthy, and inclusive Nepalese society.

DNA methylation age (DNAmA) and its deviation from chronological age, DNAmA acceleration (DNAmAA), which was calculated as residuals of leukocyte cell count adjusted linear regression of DNAmA on chronological age, were used to estimate biological age in this study. Low levels of serum selenium, selenoprotein P (SELENOP), and the selenocysteine-containing glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3) are associated with adverse health outcomes and selenium supplementation is discussed as an anti-aging intervention.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, we cross-sectionally analyzed 1568 older participants from the observational Berlin Aging Study II (mean age ± SD: 68.8 ± 3.7 years, 51% women). Serum selenium was measured by total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) spectroscopy and SELENOP was determined by sandwich ELISA. GPx3 was assessed as part of a proteomics dataset using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The relationship between selenium biomarkers and epigenetic clock measures was analyzed using linear regression analyses. P values and 95% confidence intervals (not adjusted for multiple testing) are stated for each analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Participants with deficient serum selenium levels (< 90 μg/L) had a higher rate of biological aging (DunedinPACE, β = - 0.02, SE = 0.01, 95% CI - 0.033 to - 0.004, p = 0.010, n = 865). This association remained statistically significant after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, smoking, and first four genetic principal components (β = - 0.02, SE = 0.01, 95% CI - 0.034 to - 0.004, p = 0.012, n = 757). Compared to the highest quartile, participants in the lowest quartile of SELENOP levels showed an accelerated biological aging rate (DunedinPACE, β = - 0.03, SE = 0.01, 95% CI - 0.051 to - 0.008, p = 0.007, n = 740, fully adjusted model). Similarly, after adjustment for confounders, accelerated biological age was found in participants within the lowest GPx3 quartile compared to participants in the fourth quartile (DunedinPACE, β = - 0.04, SE = 0.01, 95% CI - 0.06 to - 0.02, p = 0.001, n = 674 and GrimAge, β = - 0.98, SE = 0.32, 95% CI - 1.6 to - 0.4, p = 0.002, n = 608). Only the association with GPx3 remained statistically significant after multiple testing correction.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our study suggests that low levels of selenium biomarkers are associated with accelerated biological aging measured through epigenetic clocks.

<h4>Background</h4>Biological age reflects inter-individual differences in biological function and capacity beyond chronological age. DNA methylation age (DNAmA) and its deviation from chronological age, DNAmA acceleration (DNAmAA), which was calculated as residuals of leukocyte cell count adjusted linear regression of DNAmA on chronological age, were used to estimate biological age in this study. Low levels of serum selenium, selenoprotein P (SELENOP), and the selenocysteine-containing glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3) are associated with adverse health outcomes and selenium supplementation is discussed as an anti-aging intervention.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, we cross-sectionally analyzed 1568 older participants from the observational Berlin Aging Study II (mean age ± SD: 68.8 ± 3.7 years, 51% women). Serum selenium was measured by total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) spectroscopy and SELENOP was determined by sandwich ELISA. GPx3 was assessed as part of a proteomics dataset using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The relationship between selenium biomarkers and epigenetic clock measures was analyzed using linear regression analyses. P values and 95% confidence intervals (not adjusted for multiple testing) are stated for each analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Participants with deficient serum selenium levels (< 90 μg/L) had a higher rate of biological aging (DunedinPACE, β = - 0.02, SE = 0.01, 95% CI - 0.033 to - 0.004, p = 0.010, n = 865).

Compared to the highest quartile, participants in the lowest quartile of SELENOP levels showed an accelerated biological aging rate (DunedinPACE, β = - 0.03, SE = 0.01, 95% CI - 0.051 to - 0.008, p = 0.007, n = 740, fully adjusted model).

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review synthesising and critically assessing evidence from longitudinal, observational studies on the prospective association between neurodevelopmental conditions (NDCs) in childhood or adolescence collectively and physical long-term conditions in adulthood.

We will conduct a comprehensive search across multiple databases, without publication restrictions and will adhere to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols recommendations to ensure methodological rigour.

This study’s focus on longitudinal evidence from observational studies will strengthen the conclusions drawn from results and may facilitate causal inference across studies.

Depending on its findings, this study may represent a healthier sample of people with NDCs due to studies with significant loss to follow-up.

We plan to meta-analyse outcome data; however, due to possible heterogeneity between studies, this may not be appropriate.

The number of young people being diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental condition (NDC) has dramatically increased in recent years.1Specifically, there has been a substantial upsurge in the number of children and adolescents being referred to mental health services for suspected attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism and tic disorders (ie, Transient or Chronic Tic Disorders and Tourette’s Syndrome), without an associated intellectual disability.2,6Although neurodevelopmental profiles change across the life course, it is widely recognised that these are lifelong conditions with implications extending into adulthood.7As such, an accurate understanding of the future health needs of these young people is essential to informing the development and implementation of services and policies that address these.

It is now widely accepted that when left without appropriate support, young people with NDCs are at an increased risk of many of the social and psychiatric outcomes, which are known to be key drivers of physical health inequalities globally.8 9Specifically, recent systematic reviews of longitudinal studies have shown that compared with the general population, young people with NDCs are more likely to experience a range of mental health difficulties in adulthood, including substance use, anxiety, and depressive disorders.10 11Potentially partially due to these comorbidities, alongside a lack of educational support,12having an NDC in childhood or adolescence can also increase the risk of future unemployment,13socioeconomic disadvantage14and social exclusion.15However, despite knowledge of these heightened risks, until recently, relatively little research or clinical attention has been paid to the physical health trajectories that young people with NDCs may experience.

It is well recognised that in childhood, NDCs are associated with a range of physical health conditions and complaints.16Specifically, a systematic review of cross-sectional studies identified that children with NDCs are at an increased risk of autoimmune conditions, epilepsy and gastrointestinal complaints.17A growing body of evidence is also now emerging to demonstrate a longitudinal association between specific NDCs in childhood and adolescence and certain physical long-term conditions (LTCs) in adulthood. For example, an increased risk of type II diabetes mellitus has recently been shown among adults diagnosed with Tourette’s Syndrome as children,18while an increased risk of coronary artery disease has been identified among those previously diagnosed with ADHD.19Epidemiological studies suggest that most people with these common chronic morbidities have at least two other, and frequently more, LTCs.20It is also now increasingly understood that NDCs rarely occur in isolation and frequently co-occur.21For instance, young people with autism are known to have a mean of 3.2 comorbid NDCs,22and there is significant overlap in the aetiology, symptoms and consequences associated with these conditions.23 24

The risk of experiencing multiple physical LTCs in adulthood associated with experiencing any NDC in childhood and adolescence may therefore be substantial. However, whether this is the case remains unclear, as to date this emerging research area has been hindered by a selective focus on specific childhood NDCs or on particular physical health outcomes. Moreover, the emerging body of longitudinal research which does exist has never been systematically collated or appraised. As recently highlighted by Larsson and colleagues,25a crucial first step in advancing our understanding of all of the future health risks that young people with NDCs face is therefore integrating the results of the existing longitudinal studies in this area.

Second, while some of the factors which may account for this association have been hypothesised, the exact mechanisms which underpin it are unclear and potential targets for early intervention are therefore obscure.26These underlying mechanisms are likely complex, but modifiable lifestyle and social factors most probably play a role.25Genetic and biological factors (ie, neuromodulatory systems) have also previously been implicated,27 28but their role has never been systematically appraised. Another important task in furthering this research area is therefore identifying any biological, behavioural, psychosocial, material, structural or genetic factors which influence the risk of physical LTCs in NDCs across the life course. Comprehensively appraising the longitudinal studies which do exist is necessary in order to determine which of these factors have so far been conclusively implicated and to identify any remaining research or knowledge gaps on underlying mechanisms.

The purpose of the current review is therefore to systematically collate and appraise the research which has been conducted to date exploring the longitudinal association between three common NDCs (ADHD, autism and tic disorders) in childhood or adolescence (ie, <18 years of age) and isolated or multiple physical LTCs in adulthood (ie, >18 years of age). In doing so, we aim to answer the following research questions.

(RQ1) Is there existing evidence to suggest a longitudinal association between ADHD, autism or tic disorders in childhood or adolescence and the subsequent development of isolated or multiple physical LTCs in adulthood?

(RQ2) Are there any modifiable factors (ie, biological, behavioural, psychosocial, material, structural or genetic) which have been shown to mediate or moderate this association?

For conditions where an appropriate body of homogeneous evidence exists, we will also conduct a meta-analysis to determine what the pooled estimate is, from the existing literature, regarding the risk of each condition or condition category in adulthood among those diagnosed with an included NDC in childhood or adolescence.

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) recommendations have been used to guide the reporting in this systematic review protocol. We will follow the guidance provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions29for conducting the review itself and the PRISMA statement (2020)30for the reporting of our results.31This systematic review protocol has been registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews.

Patients and the public were involved in the development and scope of this review and will be involved in the reporting of its findings. This has been undertaken with the support of a working patient and public involvement and engagement (PPIE) group. We sought PPIE group members’ thoughts on the reviews objectives and included conditions during an initial focus group discussion. Based on their feedback during further focus groups, we will ensure that this review reports outcomes of relevance and importance to stakeholders and that the implications of our findings to the neurodivergent community are considered. Finally, we will also seek the guidance of PPIE group members prior to disseminating our findings, via a lay summary, peer-reviewed publication and conference presentations, to ensure translatability of results.

Study selection and eligibility criteria will be based on the population, exposure, comparison, outcome and study design (table 1).

ADHD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; PECOS, population, exposure, comparison, outcome, study design.

We will search for observational, longitudinal studies, from any country, which have explored the prevalence of isolated physical LTCs and/or multimorbidity among adults (ie, those over the age of 18) diagnosed with an included NDC in childhood or adolescence (ie, before the age of 18). Studies will subsequently be deemed eligible for inclusion if they adhere to the inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined below.

Longitudinal observational studies exploring the association between anincidentincluded NDC identified in childhood or adolescence (ie, before the age of 18) and anysubsequentphysical LTCs present in adulthood (ie, over the age of 18).

To minimise heterogeneity within our sample population, studies will be required to have adopted a systematic approach to the identification of NDC symptoms in childhood as defined by the relevant Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) or International Classification of Disease (ICD) criteria, or through the use of a research diagnostic protocol that matched these standards by considering symptom range, threshold, presence of impairment, chronicity and pervasiveness.

To ensure studies can be considered as beginning in childhood or adolescence, only those where participants had a mean age of <18 years old at baseline will be included.

To ensure studies are longitudinal in nature and that participants could reasonably be considered adults at follow-up, only studies where a proportion of participants were ≥ 18 years old at the time of assessment of our outcome of interest will be included.

The outcome conditions of interest are any physical LTCs (eg, cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, painful musculoskeletal conditions, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease etc) occurring in adulthood (i.e., at or over the age of 18). As per the National Institute of Health Research recommendations, this will be defined as any health problem that requires ongoing management over a period of years and which cannot currently be cured but can be controlled with the use of medication and/or other therapies.

Studies which include any cancer as an outcome will also be included, as this is now widely considered to be an LTC.

Only studies which include a comparison sample of individuals without an NDC identified in childhood or adolescence, either through the inclusion of a reference population or a control group, will be included.

Publication in English in a book or peer-reviewed journal.

Cross-sectional studies.

Studies which exclusively include those diagnosed with an included NDC in adulthood, based on either symptoms currently experienced or the retrospective reporting of childhood symptoms, will be excluded.

Studies which do not include a comparison to a non-exposed control group (ie, case series) will be excluded.

Interventional studies, including drug trials which primarily focus on the outcomes associated with a single medication or intervention for an included NDC, will be excluded.

As the interest of the current review is on the development of LTCs across the life course, studies which focus on incident or comorbid congenital conditions (ie, congenital cardiac malformations, cerebral palsy, phenylketonuria etc) will also be excluded.

Any studies which only report on physical outcomes which are not considered to meet the above definition of an LTC (ie, acute infections, accidents or injuries) will be excluded.

As our focus is on the physical health trajectories associated with our exposure of interest, studies which only report on psychiatric or mental health outcomes will also be excluded.

Databases searched electronically will be MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus and Web of Science (WoS). We have selected MEDLINE, EMBASE and WoS databases based on recommendations for the Cochrane Handbook covering major health sciences topics. We also selected specialist subject databases CINAHL Plus and PsycINFO based on their relevance to the study objectives. WHO’s trials portal and clinicaltrials.gov will be searched to identify unpublished studies or studies still ongoing. We shall conduct a manual search of the reference lists and forward and backward citation of all included studies using the WoS database for any additional papers. We shall exclude studies that are published in systematic or literature reviews but shall also examine the reference lists of relevant reviews for additional candidate studies.

The final search strategy was developed in collaboration with two medical librarians and is included inonline supplemental appendix 1.

Our exposure of interest was common NDCs, and we therefore chose ADHD, autism and/or tic disorders to be the focus of this review. Search terms for the NDCs of interest were drawn from recent Cochrane reviews for these conditions.32,34

Our outcome of interest is any physical LTCs occurring in adulthood. Therefore, we used broad search terms for physical LTCs generally. However, in order for our search strategy to be as comprehensive as possible, we also included search terms for the four conditions which account for the greatest number of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) due to physical LTCs in high-income countries where the majority of NDC studies have been conducted to date (i.e., cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, painful musculoskeletal conditions and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).35In addition, we included search terms for any other conditions which have been repeatedly identified as the most prevalent co-occurring physical LTCs among adults with an incident common mental health condition generally (hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, obesity, peptic ulcer disease, irritable bowel syndrome and chronic pain)36,40or among those with autism, ADHD or a tic disorder specifically (asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, acne, enthesopathy, migraine and epilepsy).39

Broad search terms for physical LTCs generally and for the majority of included LTCs were drawn from the most recent Cochrane review of multimorbidity.41Specific search terms for the remaining LTCs were drawn from previously published reviews on chronic pain,42 43epilepsy,44obesity,45allergic rhinitis,46peptic ulcer disease,47irritable bowel syndrome,48atopic dermatitis49and acne.50Search terms for longitudinal studies were drawn from the British Medical Journal Best Practice Guidelines.51These key terms will be combined with Boolean logic to search for relevant studies, and medical subject headings will be used to capture concepts and maximise the number of studies retrieved.

Titles and abstracts of studies retrieved from each database search will be exported to EndNote (V.X9) for deduplication, and then imported to Rayyan software for screening.52All identified manuscripts will be screened manually by one of the included authors, and artificial intelligence software will not be employed.

Following de-duplication, the titles and abstracts of all identified studies will be independently screened by two reviewers against the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify potentially relevant studies. Articles deemed potentially eligible during this initial screening will then be retrieved in full text for further assessment. Full-text articles will then be independently reviewed by two authors to confirm eligibility based on the inclusion criteria. Reasons for exclusion at each stage will be documented in a PRISMA flow diagram. Any disagreements surrounding the eligibility at either screening stage will be resolved through discussion or consultation with a third reviewer. This two-stage screening process will ensure a thorough and systematic approach to study selection.

Using a standardised data collection form, two reviewers will independently extract data from the eligible studies. For included studies, this will include the author, year of publication, country of origin, study design, sample size, a breakdown of total sample ethnicity and sex, mean age of sample at study start and end, and/or mean period of follow-up, definition of exposure (ie, NDC assessment method) and outcome (ie, physical LTC assessment method), mediators or moderators investigated, confounders adjusted for (if any), crude and adjusted effect estimates (with 95% CI) and estimates of subgroup analysis (if any) (eg, by differing forms of NDC). For studies where the mean age of the exposure and control groups are different, where possible we will calculate a pooled mean age of the total sample at the study start and report this in our results. We anticipate that for the majority of studies, the mean age of the exposure group at study entry and the mean age at NDC diagnosis will be the same. However, where these differ, we will extract and report both mean ages where possible. Where this is not possible, we will indicate whether the mean age reported in our results refers to the mean age at study entry or the mean age at NDC diagnosis. Discrepancies will be resolved by a third reviewer if necessary.

Our primary outcome of interest will be the risk of physical LTCs in adulthood among those diagnosed with an NDC in childhood, and this will be prioritised. Our secondary outcome of interest is any factors which have been identified to mediate or moderate this association. Data on any mediators or moderators involved in this association will subsequently be extracted from studies which also include this and will be analysed separately.

Quality assessment of the included studies will be conducted by two reviewers independently using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).53The NOS is a widely used measure designed to assess the quality of observational studies, with versions available for both case–control and cohort studies. It is currently a tool recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration and assesses studies according to eight items, categorised into three dimensions: selection, comparability and outcome or exposure for cohort studies or case–control studies respectively. Studies can be graded up to 1 point for all items, except comparability which has the potential to score up to 2 points, giving a maximum possible score of 9. Studies will be rated from 0 to 9 according to this scale by both reviewers, and scores will subsequently be compared and discussed. Any discrepancies will be resolved by a third reviewer if necessary. The agreed upon total scores will then be used to indicate the overall quality of each included study, with those studies rating 0–2 being identified as of poor quality, 3–5 as of medium quality and 6–9 as of high quality.

We will tabulate key information (eg, sample characteristics, exposure and outcome characteristics) regarding the association between included NDCs and physical LTCs grouped by body systems, such as those outlined intable 2(ie, cardiovascular, metabolic and endocrine, respiratory, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal and dermatological etc) and perform a narrative synthesis regarding these associations. In this narrative synthesis, we will attempt to explore differences and similarities in outcomes between the included NDCs and will also explore the possibility of reporting results for different sociodemographic (eg, by ethnicity or sex) or other potentially high-risk subgroups (ie, looked after or accommodated children).

ICD, International Classification of Disease; LTCs, long-term conditions.

We will perform a separate narrative synthesis of any identified mediating or moderating factors in this association and present these results separately. Specifically, we will categorise any factors which have been found to influence this association according to either one of the recognised pathways to inequalities in health54or to any biological or genetic influences identified through our search (table 3).

SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism.

Where possible and appropriate, meta-analyses will also be performed to calculate the overall pooled estimates of the relationship between the included NDCs combined and different physical LTCs in adulthood. Both crude and adjusted results will be displayed where possible using the generic inverse variance method. Adjustment will be based on the definition outlined in each identified study, and where possible, a hierarchy of adjustment will be created depending on the factors that are adjusted for. Studies that report similar adjustments will be analysed separately in crude and adjusted models to assess potential confounding among studies that reported adjusted estimates.

A fixed-effects model will be used where heterogeneity is low (I2value of <50%), and a random-effects model where heterogeneity is high (I2value of 50% or more) according to the Cochrane Handbook criteria.29If appropriate, a funnel plot will be used to explore the existence of publication bias by visual inspection. We will also undertake an objective assessment of publication bias using Egger’s regression test. Asymmetry of the funnel plot and/or statistical significance of Egger’s regression test (p <0.05) will be indicative of publication bias.

At least two independent reviewers will assess the strength of the body of evidence (according to the following categories: high, moderate, low and very low) for each individual outcome using the five Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) considerations for downgrading the certainty of evidence (risk of bias, impression, inconsistency, indirectness and publication bias) and the three GRADE considerations for upgrading the certainty of evidence (large magnitude of effect, dose-response gradient and residual confounding decreasing the overall effect).55

The goal of our study was to develop and validate a simple, quick, and sensitive method to detect phosphatidylethanol (PEth) in dried blood spots (DBS). A 30‐μL aliquot of blood was collected on a DBS card and allowed to dry at room temperature. Then, the spot was cut and transferred into a clean tube where the internal standard (PEth‐D5) and 1‐mL hexane were added followed by stirring, sonication, and centrifugation at room temperature. The dried supernatant was reconstituted with 30‐μL acetonitrile and analyzed by UHPLC‐HRMS‐QTOF. Calibration curve was created at 20, 50, 100, 200, 300, and 500 ng/mL; the limit of detection was calculated at 5 ng/mL (S/N > 3) while accuracy, precision, recovery, and matrix effect were successfully evaluated, along with the analyte stability at different time intervals and temperatures. The study demonstrates that quantifying PEth 16:0/18:1 from DBS cards is feasible using UHPLC‐QTOF or UHPLC‐QqQ instrumentation while the QTOF method was validated and proved reliable for PEth detection to assess both excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol abstinence, matching current guidelines. Preliminary data on authentic samples confirmed the method's performance in terms of ease, sustainability, and speed, supporting its great potential for routine toxicological diagnosis of chronic alcohol abuse.

Keywords:alcohol abuse, DBS, dried blood spot, PEth, Q‐TOF

Alcohol is potentially a psychoactive and addiction‐inducing substance, whose abuse is widespread in Europe (WHO2019). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), alcohol consumption has risen to unprecedented levels, resulting in a surge in accidents, crimes, and diseases linked to alcohol abuse and dependence (WHO2019). Binge drinking contributes to car accidents and aggressive behaviors, while chronic excessive drinking leads to severe health issues such as liver cirrhosis, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers (Gmel and Rehm2003; Rehm and Shield2019). Consequently, accurate detection of chronic or frequent excessive alcohol intake is often required by authorities in clinical or forensic contexts, including workplace testing, driving license issuance, child custody decisions, organ transplantation, and alcohol withdrawal monitoring.

Phosphatidylethanol (PEth) is a group of abnormal phospholipids formed in the body only when alcohol is present. PEth has gained popularity as a biomarker for alcohol abuse because it accumulates in red blood cells, providing a detection window of 2–4 weeks (Helander and Zheng2009; Luginbühl et al.2022). The most abundant and commonly used PEth analog for detecting chronic or excessive alcohol intake is PEth 16:0/18:1. PEth formation peaks within 8 h of alcohol consumption and remains detectable for 3–4 weeks after stopping heavy drinking. Notably, PEth is not detectable in teetotalers (Beck et al.2018; Nalesso et al.2011). Due to its extended detection window, PEth serves as an alternative or supplement to ethyl glucuronide (EtG) in hair, the gold standard for chronic alcohol abuse detection (Marques et al.2010; Morini et al.2009; Pirro et al.2011,2013).

Dried blood spot (DBS) is a microsampling technique where capillary blood is collected on filter paper, typically from a finger prick, to minimize blood volume variation. The blood is dried under controlled conditions to prevent damage. This minimally invasive method uses small blood volumes, making it safe, quick, and easy to handle, with low impact on individuals. The collection and preanalytical process are simple and resistant to manipulation.

In 2011, Faller et al. demonstrated the feasibility of detecting PEth in both whole blood and DBS, showing good correlation between venous blood and DBS results (Faller et al.2011). Since then, there have been significant advancements in sample preparation, handling, and analysis, including the automation of sample prep, which has proven effective in reducing analysis time (Fatch et al.2022). However, automation is not yet practical for small sample batches, limiting its use in forensic laboratories that need routine PEth analysis.

The present study was aimed to develop and validate a sustainable and high‐performance laboratory method using ultra‐high‐pressure liquid‐chromatograph (UHPLC) coupled with a quadrupole time‐of‐flight (QTOF) tandem high resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS) to determine PEth 16:0/18:1 concentration in DBS samples and evaluate its applicability to the diagnosis of alcohol abuse in routine laboratory workflow. Then, the results were compared with those obtained with a triple quadrupole (QqQ) tandem mass analyzer working in the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode as the use of LC‐MS/MS is thought the gold‐standard for this kind of analysis (Faller et al.2011; Fatch et al.2022; Luginbühl et al.2021; van Uytfanghe et al.2021).

The method offers several advantages, including the use of only 30 μL of blood, a simple and fast protocol, and sustainability aligned with Green Chemistry principles, such as reduced solvent use, low waste, and minimal energy consumption. The HRMS‐QTOF system enhances sample throughput, with the SWATH acquisition method that captures all MS and MS/MS spectra of detectable ions in a single run, allowing for future questions to be addressed without rerunning samples. This results in lower analysis costs, reduced sample turnaround time, fewer instruments needed, and a streamlined laboratory workflow.

Methanol, isopropanol, ammonium acetate, formic acid, hexane, and acetonitrile, were purchased from Sigma‐Aldrich (Milan, Italy). The analytical standard of PEth 16:0/18:1, PEth‐D5, and the WHATMAN FTA DMPK C cards were also purchased from Sigma‐Aldrich (Milan, Italy). Ultra‐pure water was obtained from a Milli‐Q UF‐Plus apparatus (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). Stock standard solutions were prepared in methanol at 1 mg/mL and stored at −20°C until used. Working solution of PEth 16:0/18:1 and the internal standard (ISTD) PEth‐D5 solution were prepared at the final concentration of 1 μg/mL by dilution with methanol.

The spiked specimens used in the method development and validation were prepared from a blank whole blood matrix obtained by mixing aliquots collected from 5 abstainer volunteers, stored in EDTA blood collection tubes at 4°C. Matrix effect was tested using the five separate specimen, each spiked with the relevant volume of PEth working solution. Ethical consent for the project “Diagnosis and Biomonitoring by means of Dried Blood Spots micro sampling systems” was obtained from the Bioethical Committee of the University of Turin (prot.n. 0459057/2024). The samples were tested with the QqQ for the presence of PEth and found to be negative; 50‐μL aliquots of blank blood were fortified at six concentration levels (20, 50, 100, 200, 300, and 500 ng/mL) with PEth 16:0/18:1. Then, 30 μL was spotted on a WHATMAN FTA DMPK C card using a calibrated pipette after the blood sample was vigorously stirred. The sample preparation has been performed volumetrically so there is no inference by hematocrit level. At this level the hematocrit phenomenon was not evaluated. For future large clinical studies, the hematocrit range of the calibrators should be determined and matched to the one of the target populations. The spot was allowed to dry for at least 3 h at room temperature, away from direct sunlight. The entire spot on the DBS card was punched out and transferred into a glass tube in which the following solutions were consecutively added: 250‐μL water:isopropanol:2‐mM ammonium acetate with 0.01% formic acid (2:4:0.2 vol/vol/vol), 1.5‐μL internal standard PEth‐D5 (1 μg/mL) (final concentration with respect to the blood content 50 ng/mL), and 1‐mL hexane as the extraction solvent. The tube underwent intense stirring and ultrasonication for 30 min at room temperature followed by 10 min in a multimixer and 10‐min centrifugation at 13,000 g. The supernatant was transferred into a fresh tube prior to evaporating the solvent under a nitrogen flow at room temperature (approximately 21°C). The dry residue was reconstituted with 30‐μL acetonitrile centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm and either 5 or 2 μL of the resulting solution—depending on the instrument—was injected into the UHPLC system.

The method development and validation were conducted using a UHPLC SCIEX ExionLC AC (AB SCIEX, Framingham, USA) coupled with a quadrupole/time‐of‐flight SCIEX X500R (QTOF) mass spectrometer equipped with a Turbo VTM ion source operating in electrospray negative‐ion mode (SCIEX, Darmstadt, Germany). In the QTOF instrument, a preliminary high‐resolution full scan spectrum was acquired, followed by a MS/HRMS product ion spectrum collection. The advantage of the SWATH acquisition method is that a single generic MS acquisition method is used, meaning that the mass spectrometer does not require the initial detection of an MS peak to proceed to MS/MS analysis, but it uses a wider Q1 isolation window and steps it across the entire m/z mass detection range, thus providing the possibility to get the full MS and MS/MS picture of every detectable peak in each sample without the need to reinject it. The qualitative identification was based on the accordance of the retention time, precursor ion, and characteristic fragment ions m/z values (the latter in high resolution with an accepted mass error < 5 ppm) with the pure PEth 16:0/18:1 and its theoretical exact mass values. Table1summarizes all the source and gas parameters, as well as the TOF MS and TOF MS/MS parameters used at the acquisition. Figure1shows characteristic chromatograms of PEth 16:0/18:1 at concentrations ranging from 20 to 500 ng/mL obtained with the use of SWATH on the SCIEX X500R QTOF.

Characteristic chromatograms of PEth 16:0/18:1 at concentrations ranging from 20 to 500 ng/mL obtained with the use of SWATH on the SCIEX X500R QTOF.

The results obtained for some crucial features of the method were compared with the ones obtained with a UHPLC SCIEX ExionLCTM AC (AB SCIEX, Framingham, USA) coupled to a SCIEX Triple Quad 4500 system (QqQ) (Sciex, Darmstadt, Germany). For the QqQ instrument, a SRM acquisition mode was used, and the qualitative identification was based on the same principles as above, except that the product ions were selected in low resolution. The SRM transitions used to determine PEth were 701.5 → 281.0, 701.5 → 254.9, 701.5 → 437.3, and 706.5 → 281.0 for PEth‐D5.

Concerning the instrumental analysis characteristics, both UHPLC were equipped with a Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH HILIC column (100 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) maintained at 40°C. The mobile phases for both chromatographic programs consisted of formic acid 0.1% and ammonium formate 10 mM in water (A) and acetonitrile (B). The flow rate was set at 0.5 mL/min. The mobile phase composition was programmed as follows: Elution started from A:B (v:v) 5:95 and retained for 1 min, elution at 30:70 until 3.5 min, and final re‐equilibration for 1.5 min to restore the initial conditions. The total run time was 5 min for both programs. HILIC stationary phase was chosen as it retains polar, hydrophilic compounds that are not retained on standard reversed phase columns and, complementary to strong reversed phase elution solvents starting at high organic percentage, can elute polar compounds like PEth, which is highly lipophilic. Moreover, the HILIC mode column simplifies the sample preparation for metabolites, like PEth, because the metabolic process generally results in the addition of polar groups to enhance elimination from the cellular tissue. Lastly, the injection volume was 5 μL for the QTOF and 2 μL for the QqQ instruments, respectively. The difference in the injection volume stands for the difference in the sensitivity of the two instruments. The triple–quadrupole instrument is known for its sensitivity, and it is used as the gold standard for quantification and quantification of such analytes at low concentration levels. The QTOF offers other advantages that cost a percentage of sensitivity, thus leading to different injection volumes.

For all the samples analyzed, ethical consent for the project “Diagnosis and Biomonitoring by means of Dried Blood Spots micro sampling systems” was obtained from the Bioethical Committee of the University of Turin (prot.n. 0459057/2024). The samples were tested with the QqQ for the presence of PEth and found to be negative.

Preliminary experiments were performed to evaluate the method's performance in authentic blood samples; 20 whole blood samples, collected in EDTA blood collection tubes at 4°C until spotted, deriving from driving relicense program for routine analysis were spotted (30 μL) onto WHATMAN FTA DMPK C filter papers. The aforementioned extraction protocol was applied, and the PEth concentration was determined. Following, 17 DBS samples were collected and analyzed at the laboratory as a part of the research study to further confirm the method's performance in daily practice. DBS collection was approved by the Ethics Committee of the hospital “SAN LUIGI GONZAGA,” and the volunteers participated after signing a written consent. For the method testing, samples were collected from persons in a driving license program, while no other patient‐related information was disclosed as ethical protocol ensures. The sample collection was performed by simply pricking the finger and then depositing the blood drop onto a volumetric CapitainerB Vanadate collection card. The instructions of the manufacturer were followed as described at their brochure.1

The use of CapitainerB Vanadate was selected to also examine and demonstrate the applicability of the method as an on‐site solution for alcohol determination. Before application, a preliminary experiment comparing the WHATMAN FTA DMPK C cards with the CapitainerB Vanadate collection card has been executed and no significant difference was noticed while full comparison of DBS cards with volumetric DBS card has been performed by Beck et al. (2018). Nevertheless, CapitainerB Vanadate card was preferred because it is especially designed for the detection of PEth and the enhancement of the stability. The hematocrit phenomenon did not pose any inference as the collection cards are hematocrit independent designed and the exact amount of blood is being advanced via microfluidic tube. Moreover, the correlation of values of PEth obtained by capillary and venous blood has been already extensively demonstrated and there is no significant difference between them (Beck et al.2018; Faller et al.2011; Kummer et al.2016). Then, the samples were stored at approximately 23°C prior to the analysis, and they were analyzed 1–3 days after sampling, following the extraction protocol described above.

For the method validation, spiked samples were prepared and analyzed in three working sessions along 5 days based on previously published protocols for the validation of analytical methods (Alladio et al.2020a,2020b). The performance parameters evaluated with this data set included calibration curve, intraday and interday accuracy and precision, limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantification (LOQ). Recovery, matrix effect, and analyte stability were investigated by executing further independent experiments. Several of these samples were reanalyzed by the QqQ instrument, and the results were evaluated and used to confirm the analytical method's performance on a commercial instrument other than the QTOF at concentration levels (20, 100, 200, and 300 ng/mL) close to the cut‐off values. The method used in QqQ was validated to evaluate linearity and accuracy (data not shown).

The calibration curve was created by calculating the peak‐area ratios between the target analyte and the internal standard and then plotting them on they‐axis against the known concentration levels (x‐axis). The homoscedastic or heteroscedastic distribution of the data was evaluated by examining the variance of nine data points at six concentration levels; by testing the variance increase from low to high concentrations (p< 0.05), heteroscedasticity was recognized, and the relative weighting factor was assessed (1/xor 1/x2) depending on the linear or quadratic relationship occurring between concentration and variance (Gu et al.2014). The order of the calibration model (linear vs. quadratic) was chosen on the basis of Mandel and lack‐of‐fit test results (Gu et al.2014).

For the calculation of LOD and LOQ, the Hubaux–Vos method was used considering the three lowest calibration points and 90% confidence intervals, corresponding to CCα = CCβ = 5% errors. The calculated LOD value was tested further with independent experiments on intentionally spiked samples at the predicted LOD level and then decreasing the spiked concentration until a signal‐to‐noise (S/N) ratio lower than 3 was observed. The final accepted LOD value corresponded to an S/N higher than 3 (Hubauxl and Vos1970). LOQs were attributed to the lowest concentration of the calibration range yielding accuracy values lower than the accepted limit.

Intraday and interday accuracy (expressed as bias%) were also calculated for each of the 3 days based on Alladio et al. (2020a).

Taking into account the variability factors affecting the sampling operations and the tiny blood volume collected, the accuracy was considered optimal if the bias was lower than 15% and good with bias < 20%. The method was deemed as validated if the average intraday and interday accuracy over all calibration levels remained below 20% even if single values randomly exceeded ± 20% (Alladio et al.2020a).

Intraday and interday precision, expressed as coefficient of variation (CV%), was independently assessed for the 3 days of analysis. In practice, the protocol used for calculating accuracy and precision is based on the same data collected for preparing the calibration curve, obtained in the three separate days (Massano et al.2022).

The matrix effect was estimated at the concentration level of 20 ng/mL by comparing the experimental results obtained from three blank whole blood samples and three hexane solutions, all equally spiked (with target analyte and ISTD) after the extraction step. The ionization suppression/enhancement was expressed as the mean percentage ratio between the two measured signals (Scientific Working Group for Forensic Toxicology2013).

The extraction recovery was determined at the concentration level of 500 ng/mL, by comparing the experimental results obtained from six whole blood samples, three of which spiked before and three after the extraction step. The result was expressed as the mean percentage ratio between the two signals completed with its uncertainty, expressed as extraction repeatability (CV%).

The stability of the target analyte was examined on both purposely spiked blank samples and real blood samples along different temperatures and time intervals. The reasoning of the stability tests is to evaluate at first level the stability of the analyte onto the DBS card when storing for shorter or longer periods of time compared with the initial one in the context of a forensic toxicology laboratory that stores the samples for confirmation analysis. The conditions selected stimulated the possible realistic scenarios concerning transportation (e.g., from the sampling site to laboratory) and short/long‐term storage (in case of confirmation analysis).

Spiked samples were spiked based on the aforementioned protocol at 20, 200, and 500 ng/mL (three replicates each, for each day, for both temperatures), left to dry at room temperature (RT = approximately 21°C) and at 4°C (away from direct sunlight), and stored before analysis for 1, 3, 7, and 15 days. Globally, 72 DBS samples were analyzed. The concentration levels of 20 and 200 ng/mL were selected because they are suggested as PEth 16:0/18:1 cut‐off limit for the ascertainment of abstinence and excessive alcohol intake respectively, by the consensus document recently published by thePEth‐NET society(Luginbühl et al.2022). The concentration level of 500 ng/mL was selected as suggestive of definite alcohol abuse. Likewise, whole blood received from five volunteers and was prepared likewise. The stability conditions were observed through raincloud plots that traces the concentrations calculated at the different storage temperatures and after different storage intervals (Capiau et al.2019) in comparison with those measured immediately.

The present method proved capable of detecting the target analyte at all concentration levels tested. Residues analysis and variance distributions at low, medium, and high concentration levels indicated strong heteroscedasticity of data points and quadratic dependence of the variance on PEth concentration, suggesting the adoption of a 1/x2weighting factor for the calibration model. The resulting equation was as follows:y= −0.1098 + 0.6025x− 0.0092x2. To verify the calibration model further, a linear regression F tests was performed, showing statistical significance of the quadratic component with apvalue lower than 0.05.

A LOD value of 9.7 ng/mL was calculated by the Hubaux–Vos algorithm, (Hubauxl and Vos1970). As described in Section3.2, the calculated LOD values were tested further with independent experiments to verify minimum level still yielding a S/N ratio higher than 3 (Capiau et al.2019). A LOD of 5 ng/mL was experimentally obtained, confirming that the Hubaux–Vos method provides a conservative estimation of LOD, in agreement with the high confidence limits adopted. Similar or lower LOD values for PEth were obtained after intravenous blood sampling at the expense of substantially more complex sample storage and preliminary treatment procedures (Casati et al.2019; Müller and Føreid2022; White et al.2022). The LOQ value was attributed to the lowest concentration of the calibration range, which provides adequate accuracy; consequently, the assigned LOQ for the present determination is equal to 20 ng/mL.

Interday and intraday accuracy and precision for the six concentrations tested are reported in Table2. The intraday and interday accuracy obtained from the QTOF proved optimal for almost all the calibration levels with bias% values lying below 15%; only at 50 ng/mL was this limit exceeded, possibly due to overlapping sources of random variability. The intraday and interday precision were within ± 20% in the 100–500 ng/mL interval (i.e., that useful for the assessment of excessive alcohol consumption) and moderately higher for the lowest points of calibration range. These results were compared with those obtained at the key‐point concentrations (20 and 200 ng/mL) from the QqQ instrumentation and proved consistent with them (CV% and bias % < 15%) (Table2).

Intraday and interday accuracy and precision expressed as Bias% and CV% for QTOF (six levels) and QqQ (two levels) instrumentations.

The relatively worse results obtained at 20 and 50 ng/mL have significance only if PEth determination is used to assess alcohol abstinence, not for the detection of alcohol abuse. From literature data and our own preliminary experiments on real samples, even a moderate drinker has significantly higher PEth concentrations (> 50 ng/mL), while the cut‐off proposed for excessive alcohol intake is higher than 200 ng/mL (Luginbühl et al.2021,2022; Marques et al.2010).

The extraction recovery obtained from triplicated experiments was 34 ± 5%. The relatively low extraction recovery is expected and is coherent with previous studies using DBS for the determination of other analytes (Massano et al.2022; van Uytfanghe et al.2021), because the DBS procedure involves extraction of a dried substrate from a relatively hydrophilic support, leading to potential interactions with the endogenous components present in the DBS matrix (Koster et al.2015). The matrix effect substantially indicates absent or limited ion suppression, corresponding to experimental values of −14% and −3% recorded from QTOF and QqQ instrumentation, respectively.

The stability results are comprehensively described by the raincloud and box‐and‐whiskers plots reported in Figure2a,b(at ambient temperature and 4°C) showing the ratio between the recorded concentration after 3, 7, and 15 days of storage, with respect to the concentrations recorded at Day 1.



Relative concentrations of PEth 16:0/18:1 after 3, 7, and 15 days of storage at 4°C (a) and 21°C (b), with respect to the concentrations recorded at Day 1.

At both room temperature and 4°C, the data point distributions and median showed a slight decreasing trend due to PEth degradation, which literature data report to start after 3–5 days (Heier et al.2016). This degradation trend is apparently less pronounced when the samples are stored in refrigerated conditions. These results are in accordance with the literature findings that compared the PEth stability on DBS cards under similar conditions (Bakhireva et al.2016). Overall, the observed ratio distributions show a maximum close to 1 in all the plots, demonstrating limited PEth degradation even after 1–2 weeks, independently on the storage temperature. The proven PEth stability on DBS cards under different storage conditions and time intervals, combined with the ease of sampling and the cost‐effective transportation and storage protocols, provide the accountable authorities with a practical investigation tool and reliable analysis even when the sampling place is remote and several days necessarily elapse from sampling to laboratory delivery.

After validation, preliminary experiments were performed to evaluate the method's performance in 20 authentic blood samples that were spotted 20 whole blood samples, collected in EDTA blood collection tubes at 4°C until spotted, deriving from driving relicense program for routine analysis (30 μL) onto the filter paper for the identification and quantification of the target analyte. From the 20 samples, five samples were found positive with concentrations ranging from 20 to 500 ng/mL and three to concentrations over 500 ng/mL. Four samples were found below LOQ and eight below LOD.

After having confirmed the applicability of the method, to further test it as an on‐site application, the DBS samples collected with CapitainerB Vanadate devices were analyzed. From the 17 DBS samples collected from volunteers, only two tested positive to PEth, with concentrations of 37 and 66 ng/mL, respectively. The other samples showed no significant PEth signal (below the LOD).

The study demonstrates that PEth 16:0/18:1 detection and quantification using minimal blood volume on DBS cards is reliable with UHPLC‐Q‐TOF. The validated QTOF method offers potential for routine and research use in assessing excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol abstinence, with cutoff concentrations for abstinence (< 20 ng/mL) and excessive consumption (> 200 ng/mL) within the measurable PEth range. While the stability of PEth on DBS cards has been confirmed, further research is needed to fully understand the toxicological significance of PEth levels and to explore the correlation between ethanol intake, metabolism, and PEth concentration.

DBS cards are ideal for PEth analysis due to their minimally invasive nature, easy sample collection, and long‐term PEth stability, even at ambient temperature. The method aligns with Green Analytical Chemistry principles, using minimal blood volume and reducing waste. QTOF‐HRMS instrumentation, particularly with SWATH acquisition mode, offers additional advantages by providing full MS and MS/MS spectra, enabling the detection of other phospholipids and facilitating re‐evaluation in contested cases. This approach allows for efficient, reliable, and cost‐effective alcohol monitoring worldwide.

Future research in PEth analysis should focus on several key areas to enhance its application and reliability. First, large‐scale studies are needed to explore the toxicological significance of PEth concentrations and their correlation with ethanol intake and metabolism, refining cutoffs for clinical and forensic use. Comparing PEth from DBS with other alcohol biomarkers, such as hair EtG, could expand the detection window and provide a more comprehensive approach to monitoring alcohol consumption and abstinence.

Further refinement of PEth cutoff values is essential, particularly for distinguishing moderate from heavy drinking, using real‐world sample data. Automating sample processing could reduce time and costs, improving efficiency for routine analyses, although challenges may remain for smaller forensic sample volumes. Expanding DBS use globally, particularly in low‐resource settings, could revolutionize alcohol monitoring, aided by the development of portable, cost‐effective systems for sample analysis and transport. Lastly, investigating the long‐term stability of PEth on DBS cards under different environmental conditions is also important to ensure the method's sustainability. Addressing these areas will lead to more refined methodologies, broader accessibility, and more accurate assessments of alcohol use and abstinence.

thermal management, and heat sensing applications. However, the large sensitive area is necessary to accommodate enough thermoelectric couples (TCs) for a high thermoelectric performance. This limits the potential in micro energy harvesting and ultra-sensitive sensing applications. Here, we adopted an optimized MEMS-based process to fabricate the ultra-sensitive micro-thermoelectric device (μ-TED). With the help of MEMS-compatible electrochemical deposition, the small size (25 μm), high aspect ratio (1:1.25), and alternating distributed P/N structures are achieved. As a result, the μ-TED realizes an ultra-high integration density of 19,900 thermoelectric couples per cm<sup>2</sup>. Moreover, it shows a great thermoelectric sensitivity of 212 mV/(K·cm<sup>2</sup>) and a competitive power factor of 0.51 μW/(K<sup>2</sup>·cm<sup>2</sup>), which means the μ-TED is competent for miniaturized applications. Additionally, the μ-TED shows an ultra-low detection limit of 5 mm/s and a short response time of 100 ms, revealing great potential in fast detections of the ultra-low airflow. Furthermore, the ultra-sensitive μ-TED is utilized as a flexible breath sensor, due to its compact size. The breath signal of different motion states is successfully detected.

Micro thermoelectric device (μ-TED) emerges with great attention in energy generation, thermal management, and heat sensing applications. However, the large sensitive area is necessary to accommodate enough thermoelectric couples (TCs) for a high thermoelectric performance. This limits the potential in micro energy harvesting and ultra-sensitive sensing applications. Here, we adopted an optimized MEMS-based process to fabricate the ultra-sensitive micro-thermoelectric device (μ-TED). With the help of MEMS-compatible electrochemical deposition, the small size (25 μm), high aspect ratio (1:1.25), and alternating distributed P/N structures are achieved. As a result, the μ-TED realizes an ultra-high integration density of 19,900 thermoelectric couples per cm2. Moreover, it shows a great thermoelectric sensitivity of 212 mV/(K·cm2) and a competitive power factor of 0.51 μW/(K2·cm2), which means the μ-TED is competent for miniaturized applications. Additionally, the μ-TED shows an ultra-low detection limit of 5 mm/s and a short response time of 100 ms, revealing great potential in fast detections of the ultra-low airflow. Furthermore, the ultra-sensitive μ-TED is utilized as a flexible breath sensor, due to its compact size. The breath signal of different motion states is successfully detected. These results confirm that the ultra-sensitive μ-TED holds outstanding potential for ultra-sensitive airflow sensing and energy harvesting devices.



Subject terms:Sensors, Electrical and electronic engineering

Airflow sensors have been witnessed to undergo explosive development in lots of fields, such as climatic, aerospace, and human health monitoring1–6. Recently, much attention has been focused on ultra-sensitive and fast-response airflow detections. For high-sensitivity applications, thin-film resistance sensors have realized airflow detection below 100 mm/s7. At the same time, piezoresistive airflow sensors explored many advanced materials to improve the detection performance, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs)2–4,8,9. A highly sensitive airflow sensor based on in situ-grown CNTs was reported with a detection limit of 50 mm/s2. Graphene/CNT-based airflow sensors further achieved the detection of 17.6 mm/s airflow3. However, the high sensitivity is at the cost of a large sensitive area, which is adverse to response speed. The response time mostly ranges from 0.5 to 1 s2–4,8, hard to satisfy the demand for real-time monitoring. The fiber-optic airflow sensors are superior at fast detection. An airflow sensor based on micro/nanofiber has been reported with an ultra-fast response time of 12 ms10. Unfortunately, the complex instruments limit the applications, including expensive light sources and spectrometers. Up to now, the reported airflow sensors are hard to satisfying both requirements of ultra-low detection limit and fast response time. Urgent efforts are required to promote the common improvement in detection limit and response speed.

Thermoelectric device (TED) is a superior candidate for high-sensitive detections because of its excellent energy generation and heat sensing ability11–20. Typically, the sensitivity of TED can be simply improved by increasing the amounts of thermocouples (TCs). Therefore, MEMS-based (micro-electro-mechanical system) micro thermoelectric device (μ-TED)21–23exhibits a promising potential due to the high-integration ability. The μ-TED of 10082 TCs (in 4 cm2area) is reported to successfully detect the airflow of 4 mm/s21with a response time of 1.7 s. A large sensitive area is needed for high sensitivity, which is harmful to the response speed. The size of TCs remains to be reducing, and quick-response μ-TED is in urgent need of further research.

For fast detection, low-dimension structures featuring ultra-small volume are demonstrated of positive improvements1,9,24,25. Recently reported airflow sensors with suspended CNT networks show an ultra-fast response (~21 ms)9. Single silicon nanowires also exhibit outstanding transient response performance, owning a response time of 40 ms24. Moreover, our previous work on light-driven μ-TED has achieved a fast light response (4.2 ms) by miniaturizing the light absorb layer22. Fast response (8 ms) to IR laser is also demonstrated on μ-TED5. The top connections of the μ-TED play a similar role in airflow detection. Hence, the response speed of the μ-TED is expected to be improved by miniaturizing the top connections. Further miniaturization of the μ-TED is beneficial to the both improvement of sensitivity and response speed. High-integration μ-TED is of great significance in highly sensitive and fast response airflow detections.

In this work, we report the fabrication of an ultra-sensitive micro-thermoelectric device (μ-TED) utilizing an optimized MEMS-based process. The high-performance Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3thermoelectric structures are remarkably reduced to 25 μm via electrochemical deposition (ECD). Technical difficulties in high aspect ratio (1:1.25) and alternating distributed P/N structures are overcome. As a result, this work achieved an extremely high integration density of 19,900 TCs/cm2. Additionally, the suspended top connections were miniaturized alongside the thermoelectric structures, enhancing the transient response performance. Thereafter, the thermoelectric performance and power generation ability were thoroughly investigated. Also, the airflow sensing mechanism of μ-TED is discussed, and the sensing performance of ultra-low airflow is examined. Moreover, the ultra-sensitive μ-TED was employed as a flexible breath sensor to demonstrate its potential for miniaturized and portable applications.

Figure1shows the ultra-sensitive micro thermoelectric device (μ-TED) and the schematic diagram of the airflow sensing application. The μ-TED consists of P and N-type thermoelectric elements with opposite Seebeck coefficients. The minimum units, thermoelectric couples (TCs), each contain a pair of P/N elements and connect in series. Based on the Seebeck effect, the μ-TED could convert temperature difference into electrical signal in a reversible and all-solid-state way11:

where n is the amounts of thermoelectric couples (TCs) per unit area, and SPNis the Seebeck coefficient of the P/N thermoelectric couple, ΔT is the temperature difference along thermoelectric units. The temperature difference is closely related to the heat transfer process, which enables the μ-TED to naturally own the ability of heat sensing and power generation. When the air flows through the μ-TED surface, the air heat convection Qairis generated perpendicular to the device:

wherehνis the convective heat transfer coefficient, ATis approximated to be the area of the top connection of the μ-TED, and Tairand Tμ-TEDare the temperature of the airflow and the μ-TED, respectively. Among that, the convective heat transfer coefficient hνis highly dependent on the flow velocity in reference26:

where a and b are the empirical coefficients in practical experiments, andνis the airflow velocity.



aThe practicality picture and 3D visualization of the μ-TED.bThe 2nH changes with diameter D and thickness H of TE elements. Here, 2nH represents the total length of the thermoelectric legs per unit area.cAirflow sensing simulation of μ-TED with different TE element diameters.dAirflow sensing simulation of μ-TED with different TE element thickness

According to Fourier’s heat transfer theory, the heat flow QTEflowing through the thermoelectric element can be described as the following formula:

where λ is the thermal conductivity of thermoelectric material, ATEis the cross-section area of the thermoelectric elements, and ΔT and H are the temperature difference and thickness of the thermoelectric elements, respectively.

According to formula (1)–(4), the thermoelectric potential U can be expressed as a function of airflow velocityν:

Formula (5) clearly shows the airflow sensing mechanism of the μ-TED and its influence factor. The structural features contribute a lot to sensing performance, such as the top connection area AT, the sectional area ATE, the TC density n, and the TE elements thickness H.

Among them, the ATand ATEare linearly dependent, and AT/ATEcan be approximated to a constant c (around 3.03 in this work). Formula (5) can be simplified as follows:

where the 2nH stands for the total length of the thermocouples (TCs) legs per unit area, which effectively contributes to the thermoelectric performance. Formula (6) indicates the total length of the TCs is the key factor of the airflow sensing performance.

Further, numerical analysis of the μ-TED airflow sensing performance is performed (see the Methods section). Here, the room temperature is set as 20 °C, and the bottom temperature of the μ-TED device is fixed at a constant temperature of 30 °C. For the structural parameters see Supplementary NoteS1and Supplementary Fig.S1a, Supplementary Information. As shown in simulation result Fig.1b, the decrease of the TE element diameter D exponentially contributes to the increase of the 2nH, which will greatly enhance the airflow sensing signal U(v, Tμ-TED). The influence of the TE element thickness H is relatively gentle, close to a linear relationship. The airflow detection simulations are performed as shown in Fig.1c, d. They confirm the great influence of 2nH on the airflow sensing performance. Hence, the high-integration miniaturized μ-TED is of great importance in ultra-sensitive airflow sensing.

Actually, the ultra-sensitive μ-TED is based on the highly integrated TCs. Here, we fabricated an ultra-high integration μ-TED with the MEMS-based process. High-performance thermoelectric materials, N-type Bi2Te3and P-type Sb2Te3, are introduced as TE elements due to their outstanding thermoelectric performance. Particularly, their size is reduced to 25 μm diameter, and the integration density is high to 19,900 TCs/cm2. Besides, the thick TE elements of 20 μm are achieved with a MEMS-compatible electrochemical deposition (ECD). These features make the as-reported μ-TED very competitive in power generation and airflow sensing applications.

The MEMS-based fabrication process of the ultra-sensitive μ-TED is described in Fig.2a–f. Firstly, an Au seed layer of 1-μm thickness is sputtered on the silica glass substrate with a Cr adhesion layer of 30 nm. Here, the Au is chosen as the bottom layer because of its good resistance to nitric acid. A thick photoresist of 20 μm thickness is spin-coated on the substrate, and the N-type pattern is developed by the photolithography process (Fig.2a). Secondly, the N-type Bi2Te3is fabricated directly on the N-type pattern by an electrochemical deposition (ECD) method (Fig.2b). Next, a thin photoresist (2 μm) is spin-coated, and P-type Sb2Te3is deposited by ECD (Fig.2c). Then, the bottom seed layer is etched to form the bottom electrodes (Fig.2d). In the steps of Fig.2c, d, the sample must strictly avoid to be exposed to UV-light. After that, a thick photoresist is coated and polished to the same height with thermoelectric elements. The top seed layer Cr/Au is sputtered and a Ni connection layer (2 um) is fabricated by photolithography and electroplating (Fig.2e). The ductility of Au is excellent which could withstand the subsequent processes above the thick photoresist. Finally, the useless part of the top seed layer is etched, and the residual photoresist is removed by acetone (Fig.2f). The detailed structure image during each process is shown in Supplementary Fig.S2, Supplementary information.

The red line means the test region of the step profiler.hThe height data of the top surface of the μ-TED

Figure2gdisplays the μ-TED image of the optical microscope. The sensitive area is defined as 1 mm*1 mm, which contains 199 thermoelectric couples (TCs). The integration density reaches 19,900 TCs/cm2. Figure2hshows the height information of the red line in Fig.2g. The TE elements are not distinguished from each other, because the probe owns a large angle and can’t get down to the bottom between the TE elements. The overall height of the μ-TED is about 22 μm.

Besides, Bi2Te3and Sb2Te3samples without photolithography patterns are prepared with the same ECD conditions. XRD and EDS tests are performed to investigate the phase composition, as shown in Supplementary Fig.S3(Supplementary information). Results indicate that Bi2Te3and Sb2Te3are successfully fabricated with the ECD condition in Experimental Section “Fabrication details of the ultra-sensitive μ-TED”. Further, the element composition of the μ-TED is studied by the EDS test, as shown in Supplementary Fig.S4(Supplementary information). The Bi2Te3is successfully prepared with Bi:Te ≈ 2:3. In the Sb2Te3area, the ratio of Sb:Te is 2:4.56. There is no other possible chemical compound composed of Sb and Te. Hence, the P-type TE material may be composed of 76% Sb2Te3and 24% Te. We think it is due to the slow diffusion velocity of Sb3+, which is indirectly dissolved in the ECD solution through a tartaric (organic) acid. In the micro-size opening, the diffusion of Sb3+is not efficient for the Sb2Te3deposition. Hence, additional adjustment is required for the ECD deposition of micro-size Sb2Te3structure in future research.

The micro thermoelectric device (μ-TED) converts temperature difference into electric energy with the Seebeck effect. Thermoelectric performance is of great importance in power generation and sensing applications. Here, a homemade dual temperature control platform is introduced to provide ΔT perpendicular to the μ-TED, as shown in Fig.3a(The platform is shown in Supplementary Fig.S5, Supplementary information). The temperature of the top and bottom of the platform is controlled with a resistance heater and a thermoelectric (TE) cooler, respectively. The open-circuit voltage of the μ-TED is continuously measured by a voltmeter. The environmental humidity of the testing is in the range of 40–45% RH. For instance, a step-increasing temperature difference is applied in Fig.3b, and the corresponding open-circuit voltage is recorded in Fig.3c. Here, the hollow structure and the filled structure are compared, which represent μ-TEDs before and after releasing photoresist. A 30% improvement in thermoelectric voltage is observed after releasing the photoresist. This is due to that the average thermal resistance increases and the larger temperature difference concentrates on the TE elements. To illustrate the advantage of the as-reported μ-TEDs, the output voltage density is compared with two types of thermoelectric devices of different TE element diameters. Here, the reference devices are a 4 mm*4 mm micro-TED (280 TCs; diameter: 100 μm) and a 20 mm* 20 mm commercial TEC (49 TCs; square: 1.4*1.4 mm). The as-reported μ-TED shows a thermoelectric sensitivity of 212 mV/(K·cm2), which is over 15 times better than the others. This indicates the superiority of the ultra-sensitive μ-TED. The detailed comparison with other recent research will be discussed later.

Figure3eshows the current and the output voltage with different external resistance at ΔT = 30 K. Along with the increase of external resistance, output power increases first and then decreases, reaching a maximum value of 4.5 μW at Rexternal=Rinternal. For this work, the average resistance of the μ-TED is about 232 Ω. Typically, the output power directly relies on the temperature difference distributed on the μ-TED. The thermoelectric performance of temperature difference of 10–50 K is supplemented in Supplementary Fig.S5, Supplementary information. And, the energy outputs performance of them are shown in Fig.3f. The as-reported μ-TED could generate an output power of 1.18 mW/cm2at ΔT = 50 K, showing a good power generation ability.

The airflow sensing experiment is performed to study the sensing performance of the μ-TED. A schematic diagram of the ultra-low airflow detection is shown in Fig.4a. The air is injected with a homemade motoring syringe at a certain rate Q μL/s, which converts into an airflow of velocityvmm/s according to the outlet diameter. The relationship between the injected air rate and the airflow velocityvsee Supplementary TableS1.2of Supplementary NoteS1, Supplementary information. During the experiment, the μ-TED is placed on a temperature controller to maintain the device temperature (Tμ-TED), and the injected air is the same as room temperature (Tair= 23 °C). And, the environmental humidity is in the range of 40–45% RH. Figure4bshows the open-circuit voltage of the μ-TED under different flow velocities and device temperature. The voltage signal increases gradually along with the increase of the airflow velocity. The voltage signal of the 50 °C device is higher than that of the 15 °C device, and they are going in the opposite direction. This is due to the direction of the temperature difference (Tair- Tμ-TED). The baseline under no airflow is not zero. This is in agreement with the formulas (3) and (6), as the constantais not equal to zero. Even the external flow velocity is down to zero, the temperature difference between the μ-TED device and the air leads the surrounding air to flow spontaneously, which is namely the natural thermal convection.

To clearly study the relationship of thermoelectric voltage vs flow velocityv, the baseline is recorrected to zero. The corresponding voltage signal is shown in Fig.4c, where the airflow velocity ranges from 5 to 160 mm/s. The thermoelectric voltage U shows a linear relation with the flow velocityvunder each device temperature. This is due to the linear change of the heat transfer coefficienth, following the formula (3) and (6). The sensitivity, defined as U/vfor each airflow velocity, is calculated in Fig.4d. It shows good stability among airflow velocity of 20–160 mm/s. The sensitivity values from 15 to 50 °C are −6.65, −3.08, 4.16, 11.91, and 17.96 mV/(m/s), respectively. Moreover, the as-reported μ-TED could detect ultra-low airflow below 20 mm/s, as shown in Fig.4e. It still shows a good linearity at a flow velocity of 5–20 mm/s. The corresponding sensitivity is shown in Supplementary Fig.S6d, Supplementary information. The sensitivities of 5–20 mm/s airflow are slightly increasing with the airflow velocity, and lower than that of airflow velocity above 20 mm/s. This means the heat transfer coefficienthvdoes not strictly follow the empirical formula (3) at ultra-low airflow. In addition, the original data of 5–10 mm/s velocity (Tμ-TED= 50 °C) is displayed in Fig.4f. The RMS of the noise is about 7.15 μV. The signal of 5 mm/s is 8 times higher than the noise level. The voltage signals of 5, 7.5, and 10 mm/s are distinguishable from each other. These results indicate the μ-TED owns an airflow detection limit of 5 mm/s, as well as a resolution of 2.5 mm/s. The numerical simulation show the μ-TED owns the potential to detect the airflow velovity of 4.03 mm/s, as shown as Supplementary Figs.S6a–S6c(Supplementary information). Besides, the stability of the airflow test is performed, as shown in Supplementary Fig.S7(Supplementary information). The μ-TED shows good stability in the long-period test and cycle test at a device temperature of 50 °C. Notably, the as-reported μ-TED achieves a sensitivity close to reference21with a sensitive area of 1 mm2, only 1/400 of the latter (4 cm2; sensitivity of 25–50 mV/(m/s) at Tμ-TED= 50 °C). The area of the μ-TED is significantly miniaturized, which makes the device’s temperature free of the disturbance of the external environment. Hence, the as-reported μ-TED exhibits an ultra-low airflow detection limit of 5 mm/s.

Further, the transient response of the μ-TED is studied, as shown in Fig.4g. With the increase of the airflow rate, the voltage signal reaches the maximum value more quickly. This is because of the increase of the heat transfer coefficienth, following formula (3). The heat exchange is more intense, prompting the μ-TED to reach an equilibrium state faster. Figure4hshows the response time of the μ-TED under different airflow velocities. Here, the response time is defined as the duration of the voltage signal rising from 10% to 90% of the maximum signal. The response time decreases sharply at first and finally approaches a stable value. The response time of 100 ms is achieved when the airflow velocity is higher than 140 mm/s. Furthermore, the response performance of the μ-TED working on different device temperatures is stable, which is shown in Supplementary Fig.S6e, Supplementary information. These results indicate the μ-TED exhibits a fast response in low-velocity airflow sensing.

Then, the structural parameter and thermoelectric performance comparison of recently reported μ-TED is performed to illustrate the superiority of the as-reported μ-TED, as shown in Fig.520,23,27–39. Detailed data is listed in Supplementary NoteS3, Supplementary information. The integration density and thermocouple’s length (namely the TE material’s thicknesses) are key structural parameters, which deeply influence the thermoelectric performance of the μ-TEDs. However, due to technological limitations, μ-TEDs of large TE thickness (>20 μm) usually result in poor integration density15,20,23,31,36. Here, we chose a TE thickness of around 20 μm and achieved a great TC density of 19,900 TC/cm2by an elaborately designed MEMS-based process. As a result, the 2nH of as-reported μ-TED is over 10 times higher than recently reported μ-TED20,23,27–39. Then, Fig.5bshows the power factor and the thermoelectric voltage factor of these μ-TEDs, which represent the power-generating ability and sensing ability, respectively. Recent works of μ-TED take much effort to improve the power-generating ability14,15,21–23,36–38, including thermal structure design, reducing contact resistance, and so on. However, these do not significantly influence the sensing sensitivity per unit area. Hence, the sensing sensitivity is not efficient in meeting the requirement of miniaturized applications, where the device area is limited. Our work promotes the sensing performance by increasing the effective TC length 2nH. This not only greatly improves the sensing sensitivity but is also beneficial to a good power-generating ability. As a result, the as-reported μ-TED achieves a remarkably superior thermoelectric performance of 212 mV/(K·cm2). At the same time, it owns a competitive power factor of 0.51 μW/(K2·cm2), compared with reference23,28, and36. These great merits provide promising potential in mini-sized systems, including micro sensors and micro energy harvest devices.



The structural parameter (a) and thermoelectric performance (b) comparison of recently reported μ-TED20,23,27–39.cThe airflow sensing performance of recently reported airflow sensors1–10,24,25,40–42

Furtherly, the airflow sensing performance is compared with recently reported airflow sensors1–10,24,25,40–42, as shown in Fig.5c. Detailed data is listed in Supplementary NoteS4, Supplementary information. This work is of good superiority in detection limit, as it can detect a minimum airflow of 5 mm/s, close to the ultra-sensitive graphene-based airflow sensor8. The response time is around 100 ms, almost 5 times faster than graphene-based piezoresistive airflow sensors. These results reveal the promising potentials of the as-reported ultra-sensitive μ-TED in quick detections of ultra-low airflow.

The ultra-sensitive μ-TED owns an excellent heat sensing performance (Fig.5b) even in a 1 mm2sensitive area. Therefore, it is expected to achieve flexible applications due to its very small size. Figure6ashows the schematic diagram of the breath detection with the μ-TED-based flexible sensor. Here, the flexible airflow sensor is made by directly bonding the μ-TED with a flexible PEN film, which has prepared the connecting electrode beforehand. The flexible airflow sensor is pasted under the nose to monitor the breath signal. Here, the exhaled and inhaled air can be regarded as body temperature and room temperature, respectively. They alternately flow past the μ-TED surface generating the thermoelectric signal.

The human breath detection of the μ-TED sensor is shown in Fig.6b, containing sitting, walking, and running states. The bottom and the upper picture represent the original signal and the wavelet analysis result, respectively. The original voltage signal changes with the human state. With the increase of the exercise intensity, the breath becomes quicker and stronger. After wavelet analysis, it is found that the frequency and the magnitude show distinct differences. That means the behavior recognition is expected to be achieved with the μ-TED sensor. In addition, part signals of each motion state are extracted in Fig.6c–e. Detailed voltage signals of exhaling and inhaling can be found in Supplementary Fig.S8a, Supplementary Information. The breathing frequency during the sitting, walking, and running motion states are 0.18 Hz, 0.23 Hz, and 0.35 Hz, respectively. And the voltage magnitudes are 3.62, 6.32, and 9.46 mV, respectively. These are in agreement with the wavelet analysis result. The ultra-sensitive μ-TED shows a promising potential for health monitoring.

The above results provide a simple demonstration of breath detection. For actual operating conditions, many specific issues should be taken into consideration. The bonding part and electrical connections between the μ-TED and flexible part should be carefully concerned, which determines the reliability and durability. Besides, the device may usually work in an environment of high humidity, even in direct contact with the sweat of the human skin. Effective encapsulation is essential to avoiding short-circuit and erosion of thermoelectric materials. Here, the Supplementary Fig.S8b–e(Supplementary Information) discussed a PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane) encapsulated μ-TED. The device shows good water resistance (humidity). However, the sensitivity to airflow reduced a lot, which is caused by the additional thermal resistance of thick PDMS. The conformal thin film would be superior, such as parylene encapsulation. Further effort is needed to explore the potential of the μ-TED in wearable devices, including thin film encapsulation, flexible electrical connection, and so on.

In summary, an ultra-sensitive μ-TED is successfully fabricated by the MEMS-based technology. High-performance Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3TCs with a compact feature size of 25 μm are integrated by electrochemical deposition (ECD). And the TCs integration density of the μ-TED is up to 19,900 TCs/cm2. Benefitting from that, the μ-TED shows an excellent thermoelectric performance of 212 mV/(K·cm2) and a competitive power factor of 0.51 μW/(K2·cm2). Moreover, the effective total TC length 2nH is high to 796 mm/cm2, greatly promoting airflow sensitivity. The μ-TED exhibits an ultra-low airflow detection limit of 5 mm/s and a fast response time of 100 ms only with a 1 mm2sensitive area, revealing great potential in fast detection of ultra-low airflow. Moreover, the ultra-sensitive μ-TED, due to its compact size, was employed as a flexible breath sensor. Breath signals of various human states are successfully detected, demonstrating the potential for miniaturized and portable applications. Briefly, this work achieves an ultra-sensitive μ-TED airflow sensor and demonstrates a miniaturized wearable application. For future consideration, it also reveals some issues that need to be considered. Especially, the purity of thermoelectric materials deposited in micro hole should be carefully optimized, which would provide a further improvement in thermoelectric performance. To reduce the fabrication cost, seed layer material with good acid resistance and ductility needs exploring to replace Au. Additional attempts are also required in developing the integration and encapsulation method in the wearable applications. Along with these efforts, μ-TED will provide a promising application potential in self-powered, multi-functional, and flexible electronic systems.

The thick photoresist used in the deposition of TE materials is AZ 4903 (high viscosity). It was spin-coated with a rotation rate of 1100 rpm. Then, it was backed at 95 °C for 40 min for curing. The thin photoresist used in the top connections is AZ 4330 (low viscosity). It was spin-coated with a rotation rate of 1600 rpm and backed at 95 °C for 10 min. The photoresist AZ 4903 and AZ 4330 are both developed with the same solution (AZ400K: H2O = 3:1, in volume). The Cr/Au seed layers are sputtering at a pressure of 5*10−4Pa and a power of 150 W. The seed layers of bottom and top connections are 800 nm and 300 nm, respectively. The Cr and Au layers are etched by I/KI solution and KMnO4solution, respectively. The polish of thermoelectric materials is manually operated with 3 M sandpaper of 5000#.

The thermoelectric materials Bi2Te3and Sb2Te3are electrochemically deposited with a nitric acid-based solution43–45(see Supplementary NoteS2, Supplementary Information). And, they are deposited with pulsed voltage for better uniformity. The Eon/Eoffof Bi2Te3and Sb2Te3are −0.03/0.1 V and −0.195 /0.1 V, respectively. Here, the deposition potential Eonis examined with cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves, (see Supplementary Fig.S3a, d, Supplementary Information). And the Ton/Toffof Bi2Te3and Sb2Te3are 0.1/0.2 s and 0.1/0.4 s, respectively.

The numerical analysis of the airflow sensing process is performed with COMSOL Multiphysics. Here, the μ-TED is simplified to a single TE unit, because its TE units are under similar conditions. The TE unit parameters are shown in Supplementary NoteS1and Supplementary Fig.S1a, Supplementary information. The room temperature is set as 20 °C, and the bottom temperature of the μ-TED device is fixed at a constant temperature of 30 °C. The boundary condition of the top connection is set as convective heat flux. The heat transfer coefficienthvis defined in terms of a+bv(vstands for the flow velocity)26. Here, the values of a and b are set as 5.7 and 3.8, the same as the ref.26. Supplementary Fig.S1bandS1c(Supplementary information) show the temperature and electric potential distribution of the numerical results.

The airflow performance is performed with a homemade micro-syringe. The injection rate is controlled with a stepper motor. The relationship between the injection flow rate Q (μL/s) and airflow velocityv(mm/s) is listed in Supplementary TableS1.2of Supplementary NoteS1, Supplementary information. The thermoelectric performance is tested with a homemade temperature control platform, see Supplementary FigureS5a, Supplementary information. The electrical output is measured with a Keysight 34420A digital volt meter. Transient response of the μ-TED is detected with National Instruments 6289.

However, health equity has yet to be achieved. This study explored the experiences of women with refugee backgrounds during pregnancy, birth, and postpartum in Norway. We aimed to understand how the diversity of their backgrounds and current life circumstances, influenced the women's health, well-being, and interactions with maternal healthcare services. The study focused on the perspectives of women whose needs have not been fully acknowledged in maternal healthcare services both at national and local levels.<h4>Method</h4>Consistent with our Feminist Participatory Action Research approach, we included multicultural doulas, women with lived experience of migration and giving birth in Norway, as co-researchers. We also collaborated with practitioners such as midwives and other relevant actors. We recruited and conducted qualitative interviews with ten women with refugee backgrounds who had given birth in Norway.<h4>Results</h4>Our findings revealed that the women's intersecting identities were crucial in shaping their maternal healthcare needs during pregnancy, birth and postpartum. The structural inequities faced in maternal healthcare services during pregnancy such as lack of language and communication support, limited access to social support networks, and unfamiliarity with healthcare services were also apparent during birth and postpartum.

<h4>Background</h4>Norway is recognised for its high-quality maternal healthcare. However, health equity has yet to be achieved. This study explored the experiences of women with refugee backgrounds during pregnancy, birth, and postpartum in Norway. We aimed to understand how the diversity of their backgrounds and current life circumstances, influenced the women's health, well-being, and interactions with maternal healthcare services. The study focused on the perspectives of women whose needs have not been fully acknowledged in maternal healthcare services both at national and local levels.<h4>Method</h4>Consistent with our Feminist Participatory Action Research approach, we included multicultural doulas, women with lived experience of migration and giving birth in Norway, as co-researchers. We also collaborated with practitioners such as midwives and other relevant actors. We recruited and conducted qualitative interviews with ten women with refugee backgrounds who had given birth in Norway.<h4>Results</h4>Our findings revealed that the women's intersecting identities were crucial in shaping their maternal healthcare needs during pregnancy, birth and postpartum. The structural inequities faced in maternal healthcare services during pregnancy such as lack of language and communication support, limited access to social support networks, and unfamiliarity with healthcare services were also apparent during birth and postpartum. Adjusting to a new country while raising children compounded these challenges, impacting experiences of pregnancy, birth, and postpartum.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study highlights the importance of adopting an intersectional approach to maternal healthcare, and not treating race, class, gender and migration experiences in isolation, but taking them into consideration when designing and implementing services.

It demonstrates post-therapeutic hemosiderin deposition, granulation tissue formation, fibrosis, and calcification. Our research aims to establish the multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) value for predicting UPS treatment response.<h4>Methods</h4>An IRB-approved retrospective study included 33 extremity UPS patients with pre-operative mp-MRI, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), contrast-enhanced susceptibility-weighted imaging (CE-SWI), and perfusion-weighted imaging with dynamic contrast-enhancement (PWI/DCE), and surgical resection between February 2021 and May 2023. Lesions were visually classified on CE-SWI into one of 6 morphology patterns. On PWI/DCE, lesions were classified into one of 6 patterns, and time-intensity curves (TICs) were classified as types I-V. Patients were categorized into three groups based on the percentage of pathology-assessed treatment effect (PATE) in the surgical specimen: Responders (> = 90% PATE, n = 16), partial-responders (31-89% PATE, n = 10), and non-responders (< = 30% PATE, n = 7).<h4>Results</h4>At post-radiation therapy (PRT), a CE-SWI Complete-Ring pattern was observed in 71% of responders (p = 7.71 × 10<sup>-6</sup>). On PWI/DCE images, 79% of responders displayed a Capsular pattern (p = 1.49 × 10<sup>-7</sup>), and 100% demonstrated a TIC-type II (p = 8.32 × 10<sup>-7</sup>). ROC analysis comparing responders (n = 14) vs. partial/non-responders (n = 16) at PRT showed that the model combining PWI/DCE TIC-type II, PWI/DCE Capsular pattern, and CE-SWI Complete-Ring pattern yielded the highest classification performance (AUC = 0.99), outperforming PWI/DCE Capsular + TIC-type II (AUC = 0.97), PWI/DCE Capsular (AUC = 0.89), PWI/DCE TIC-type II (AUC = 0.88), and CE-SWI Complete Ring (AUC = 0.79). Contrary to prior reports, DWI/ADC played a secondary role in predicting response: ADC mean & skewness (AUC = 0.63). RECIST demonstrated 100% stability at PRT and 100% pseudo-progression at PC in responders and partial/non-responders (AUC = 0.47).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Mp-MRI-derived features are valuable in assessing UPS treatment response. A pre-operative model that combines PWI/DCE TIC-type II, PWI/DCE Capsular pattern, and CE-SWI Complete Ring pattern can reliably predict successfully treated UPS with > = 90% PATE, outperforming RECIST, which was proven unreliable in separating responders from partial/non-responders.

Subject terms:Drug development, Immunological techniques

Within the tumor microenvironment, cancer cells express inhibitory ligands, through which cancer cells function to promote tumor immune tolerance and evade immune system eradication.1Recently, the pharmacological modulation of these pathways, termed immune checkpoint (IC) therapy, has been extensively investigated and developed as novel immunotherapeutic agents for cancer treatment.2In the last decade, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in immunotherapy has dramatically improved the treatment outcomes for various cancer types.3The clinical use of ICIs that target CTLA4, PD-1, and PD-L1 have revolutionized cancer treatment, a milestone recognized by the awarding of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology.4

ICIs, as a class of monoclonal antibodies, possess the capability to bind with high specificity to ICs on the surface of cells. Each monoclonal antibody molecule has the potential to bind to a single epitope on the target protein. Given this, maintaining a sufficient inhibitor concentration at the desired site of action for the required duration is crucial to achieving their immunomodulatory functions against cancer.5The above issues are felt most keenly when designing inhibitors, so other modalities are being used to circumvent such limitations. The most representative one is Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs), which as catalytic agents facilitate the recruitment of target proteins to E3 ubiquitin ligases, thereby tagging the target proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Unlike conventional inhibitors that suppress protein activity through sustained binding, PROTACs induce targeted protein degradation, allowing them to achieve therapeutic effects at lower concentrations with degrader recycling.6Furthermore, similar techniques, such as Lysosome-targeting chimeras (LYTACs) and antibody-based PROTACs (AbTACs),7springs up recently for targeting out membrane proteins. These technologies depend on specific natural degradation processes, making them difficult to develop a straightforward and widely used approach applied for all cell types. ICs normally require post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as phosphorylation and glycosylation,8to enable a broad range of functions. N-glycosylation is one of the most extensive PTMs on the extracellular surface of ICs, which adds glycan moieties to asparagine side-chains of proteins. N-glycosylation plays a prominent role in common biological process, such as cellular differentiation, cell–cell communication, protein stability, tumorigenesis and immune response.9–13Approximately 80% of cell-surface proteins are N-glycosylated, and abnormal glycosylation of tumor cells can interfere with immune cell recognition, weakening their anti-tumor effects. Therefore, blocking N-glycosylation on the surface of tumor cells can enhance the cytotoxicity of CAR-T cells against malignant tumors.14

N-glycosylation plays a prominent and multifaceted role in the immune response, particularly in the regulation of a series of immune checkpoint (IC) pairs, such as PD-L1 and PD-1, PVR and TIGIT, CTLA4 and B7-1, and CD70 and CD27.15While, the functions of N-glycosylation on a bunch of ICs remain unstudied. We propose that by fusing a target recognition element to Peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGF), a general N-glycan eraser which is widely used in removing N-glycans on the cell surfaces and intact proteins,16to specifically erase the N-glycans of target proteins. This strategy not only expands the toolkit for membrane protein manipulation but also provides a novel method for studying and therapeutically targeting glycosylation-dependent processes. Moreover, similar to other advanced protein-targeting technologies like PROTACs (Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras), LYTACs (Lysosome-Targeting Chimeras), and AbTACs (Antibody-Based PROTACs), which have emerged recently as powerful tools for targeting membrane proteins, these approaches leverage the catalytic and recyclable nature of the fusion complex to achieve precise and efficient modulation of protein function. These technologies share a common principle of using bifunctional molecules to bridge target proteins with effector mechanisms, such as degradation or modification, offering a high degree of specificity and potency.

Here, we developed a technique that can specifically erase the glycans from a target protein on live cells through combination of PNGF with the specific nanobody/affibody (Nb/Af) of the target protein, in which the complex was termed Deglycosylation Targeting Chimera (DGlyTAC). We engineered specific DGlyTACs for various proteins, achieving targeted removal of N-glycans from the desired proteins, including growth factor receptors (EGFR, HER2, IGF1R) and ICs (CD24, CD47, PD-L1), while exerting minimal influence on the overall N-glycosylation landscape. DGlyTAC technique is a general strategy for in situ elimination N-glycans to disrupt the binding of CD24/Siglec-10, as well as the affinity of PD-L1/PD-1. This property not only enhances their therapeutic potential but also minimizes off-target effects and reduces the risk of toxicity, making them highly suitable for clinical applications. By leveraging the specificity of target recognition elements and the enzymatic activity of PNGF, this approach could revolutionize the study and therapeutic targeting of glycosylated immune checkpoint proteins. It opens new avenues for understanding the role of N-glycosylation in immune regulation and provides a versatile platform for developing next-generation immunotherapies, particularly in cancer treatment, where immune checkpoint modulation is a key strategy. This innovative technique could also be extended to other diseases where glycosylation plays a critical role, further broadening its impact on biomedical research and therapeutic development.

To prove the concept, we first applied our strategy to a tag-fused protein with fewer N-glycosylation sites and a smaller molecular weight. Cluster of differentiation 24 (CD24), a glycoprotein contain two N-glycosylation sites and anchors to glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol (GPI),17we first fused CD24 with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) at the N-terminus as a tag for targeting. We transfected pcDNA3.1-eGFP-CD24 plasmid into CHO cells (termed CHO-CD24) which lack of CD24 expression. We then confirmed that treatment with 500 nM PNGF for 2 h in serum-free RPMI medium removed nearly all N-linked glycans from eGFP-CD24 and resulted in the appearance of protein bands with lower molecular weights (Fig.1a). To improve specificity, we engineered PNGF which was fused with an N-terminal nanobody against eGFP (nbGFP) to generate DGlyTAC nbGFP-PNGF. De-N-glycosylation of eGFP-CD24 was completely achieved with 5 nM nbGFP-PNGF (PNGF fused to nanobody with targeting capability), whereas 500 nM PNGF (lack of targeting capability) could not (Fig.1a, b)—in other words, nbGFP-PNGF required only one-hundredth of the concentration of PNGF to obtain optimal results. In parallel, mutation of PNGF at catalytic residue 206 from glutamic acid to lysine rendered an inactive enzyme (nbGFP-PNGF-E206K), which was served as a negative control (Fig.1c). We also proved the same complete de-N-glycosylation of nbGFP-PNGF on eGFP-CD24 in both cell lysis and live cells (Supplementary Fig.1a). The remarkable difference between PNGF and nbGFP-PNGF was because of a high binding affinity of nbGFP to eGFP (Kd = 5.58 ± 2.73 nM, Supplementary Fig.1b).



Design of DGlyTAC nbGFP-PNGF for protein-specific de-N-glycosylation on eGFP-CD24. Western blot analyzed the effect on the expression and glycosylation of eGFP-CD24 which overexpression on CHO cell lines after the treatment of different concentrations of PNGF (a), nbGFP-PNGF (b), and nbGFP-PNGF-E206K (c) for 2 h. (d) eGFP-CD24 was enriched by anti-eGFP beads and analyzed by immunoblotting to reveal protein levels (anti-GFP) and N-glycosylation level (ConA). CHO-CD24 whole cell lysate (WCL) was treated with 1 μM PNGF (as positive control, PC), PBS (as nagative control, NC), 0.05 nM PNGF, nbGFP-PNGF, and nbGFP-PNGF-E206K for 24 h, we proceeded with the labeling of N-glycans using ConA-Biotin.

To further prove the specificity of nbGFP-PNGF, we used mannose specific lectin Concanavalin A (ConA)-Biotin to detect mannose residues in N-glycans and represent the level of N-glycosylation.18Treatment with nbGFP-PNGF exhibited completed removal of N-glycans on eGFP-CD24, while its effect on the global N-glycosylation levels was negligible (Fig.1d, e). Moreover, nbGFP-PNGF did not significantly reduce the N-glycosylation level of H2-K1 (MHC class I heavy chain precursor) on CHO cells, which could be de-N-glycosylated with high concentration of PNGF (Supplementary Fig.1h-i). Furthermore, we also explored the effects of the enzyme on eGFP-CD24 protein level at different time points. Treatment with 5 nM nbGFP-PNGF, but not PNGF, for more than 2 h could compromise the CD24 quantity in serum-free RPMI medium because of the removal of N-glycans (Fig.1f, g). It was noteworthy that low concentrations of nbGFP-PNGF also worked well with extended processing time (like 24 h) in medium containing fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Fig.1h), indicating that serum does not significantly affect the efficiency of enzymatic de-N-glycosylation. Due to the high efficiency of nbGFP-PNGF, 0.008 nM enzyme de-N-glycosylated the majority of eGFP-CD24. Therefore, nbGFP-PNGF is employed to selectively remove N-glycans of eGFP-CD24 on the cell surface while minimally affecting the global N-glycosylation landscape.

Siglec-10, an IC, is capable of recognizing both surface proteins (e.g., CD24) and surface sialic acids.19Upon binding of CD24 to Siglec-10, an inhibitory signaling cascade occurs to prevent macrophage phagocytosis and promote tumor growth.19We next tested whether de-N-glycosylated CD24 could also bind to Siglec-10. Our results showed that de-N-glycosylated CD24 lost most of the interaction with Siglec-10 (Fig.1i, j, m, Supplementary Fig.1c), suggesting that N-glycans on CD24 are essential for binding to Siglec-10. It has been reported that Siglec-10 interacts with highly sialylated form of CD24.20Meanwhile, deletion of CD24 nearly abolished Siglec-10 binding in absence of surface sialylation, indicating that CD24 is the major protein binder of Siglec-1020. Moreover, Siglecs also specifically interact with sugar chains via the sialic acid linkage, and consequently N-glycans of complex structure can be recognized and linked to Siglec-1021. We also evaluated the contribution of sialic acids to CD24 with Siglec-10 binding through the use of P-3Fax-Neu5Ac (a global sialyltransferase inhibitor22) on CHO-WT and CHO-CD24 cells, and a significant decrease in Siglec-10 interaction of all groups was observed (Fig.1k, l). As expected, no Siglec-10 binding was observed in CHO-WT with P-3Fax-Neu5Ac treatment. Unexpectedly, a significant decrease of Siglec-10 interaction was also observed via the treatment of nbGFP-PNGF after P-3Fax-Neu5Ac treatment (Fig.1k, l, Supplementary Fig.1d–f), indicating that even without sialic acid modification, the N-glycosylation on CD24 still participates in the binding of CD24/Siglec-10. Overall, in CHO-CD24 cells, N-glycans accounted for more than 82% of the CD24/Siglec-10 interaction, and more than a half of the CD24/Siglec-10 interaction was from non-sialyl N-glycosylated CD24 (Fig.1m, n, Supplementary Fig.1g), indicating the significance of N-glycosylation on CD24 in CD24/Siglec-10 interaction.

Next, we performed in vitro phagocytosis assay by incubating bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with either CHO-CD24 cells or CHO-WT cells as control. As expected, we found that nbGFP-PNGF increased phagocytosis by approximately 0.5-fold compared with that of control (Fig.2a, d), indicating that de-N-glycosylation of CD24 significantly increased the phagocytosis by macrophages. We also used cytochalasin D (decrease the polymerization and depolymerization of actin, an inhibitor of phagocytosis),23to present that the phagocytosis is not fake rather than two cells stuck together (Supplementary Fig.2d–g).

Another well-known IC pair is CD47-SIRPα. The highly glycosylated portion of CD47 is also essential for its interaction with ligands like integrins.24N-glycosylation sites on CD47 are responsible for keeping the interaction interface reachable.25The high-affinity binding domain from SIRPα was made as a nanobody for CD47 (nbCD47).26Thus, we fused PNGF to nbCD47 to generate DGlyTAC nbCD47-PNGF. Different kinds of cancer cells (MDA-MB231, HeLa, and SW620) were partially deglycosylated by PNGF or nbCD47-PNGF for 24 h in serum-free RPMI medium (Supplementary Fig.2a–c and3m). Using nbCD47-PNGF, bands shifted to smaller sizes with partial N-glycosylation erased. Next, we performed in vitro phagocytosis assay, in which cells were incubated with PNGF, nbCD47-PNGF or nbCD47-PNGF-E206K. There existed a significant increase in phagocytosis upon treatment of DGlyTAC nbCD47-PNGF rather than PNGF or the inhibitor competitor nbCD47-PNGF-E206K in HeLa and SW620 cells (Fig.2b, c, e, f).

Our results showed that de-N-glycosylation of both CD24 and CD47 significantly increased the phagocytosis by macrophages, indicating that N-glycosylation accounts for the interactions between CD24 and Siglec-10, as well as CD47 and SIRPα.

Inspired by these results, we were encouraged to expand the target proteins of DGlyTACs, to a more abundant cell surface protein type—growth factor receptors, which are well-studied with a series of affibodies and nanobodies. Furthermore, N-glycosylation plays a critical role in the extensive expression of growth factor receptors on the cell surface, facilitating their accurate localization on the cell membrane.27

We chose IGF1R as our initial investigated growth factor receptor. IGF-1 is regulated by the tyrosine kinase receptor IGF-1R which is synthesized as a single polypeptide precursor.28Activated IGF-1R is proteolytically cleaved into several chains with different weights (α subunit 130 KDa and β subunit 97 KDa) that form a tetramer (α-β-β-α).28Each α and β subunit contains 11 and 5 N-glycosylation sites, respectively.28A number of studies have shown that IGF-1R is accurately matured and transported to the cell surface when its N-glycosylation is appropriately maintained.29,30The affibody molecule afIGF1R (Kd = 2.3 nM), which binds to the hormone interaction site in IGF-1R, efficiently recognizes IGF1R-β in various contexts.31After partially de-N-glycosylation by PNGF or afIGF1R-PNGF in serum-free RPMI medium for 2 h in different kinds of cancer cells (MCF7, HepG2 and SK-BR-3), the bands shifted to the smaller size (~70 kDa) compared to that of control group. The afIGF1R-PNGF showed higher ability than PNGF in removal of N-glycans from IGF1R-β (Supplementary Fig.3a–c, l).

Similar strategy was applied to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and one of its homologous receptors HER2. The EGFR is one of the most studied growth factor receptors, which can form one type of homodimer and three types of heterodimers constituted by EGFR and HER2, thus regulating critical cellular processes and serving as an important target for cancer therapy. In order to understand the complex functions of EGFR/HER2 on the membrane, structural analysis is deeply required. Due to heterodimerization, these receptors can be activated by a greater number of ligands and also capable of initiating various signaling pathways.32N-glycosylation plays an important role in membrane interaction, structure establishment, and dimer formation.27We fused affibody molecule of afEGFR (Kd = 2.8 nM) and afHER2 (Kd = 3 nM) to PNGF, respectively.33,34The protein bands of EGFR and HER2 were shifted to a smaller size in the afEGFR-PNGF and afHER2-PNGF groups compared to that in control group (Supplementary Fig.3d–i), but not as small as the non-N-glycosylated forms (Supplementary Fig.3j, k). EGFR and HER2 are large proteins with substantial molecular weights, which complicates the ability of DGlyTACs to access all glycosylation sites on these proteins. Additionally, PNGF preferentially cleaves N-glycosylation sites found in loop regions of the proteins. This may because the N-glycosylation sites in EGFR and HER2 always locate on the α-helix/β-helix foldings, which may lead to the suboptimal use of afEGFR-PNGF and afHER2-PNGF for editing the N-glycans. Additionally, EGFR and HER2 proteins have a large molecular weight and many N-glycosylation sites. Even using a high concentration (1 μM) of PNGF, only one or two N-glycan sites can be removed, indicating that other glycosylation sites are not accessible to PNGF. Glycosylation of cell surface growth factors is a sophisticated and crucial biological process that markedly influences cell function and behavior. Researches into glycosylation of these receptors not only contribute to better understanding of relevant disease mechanisms but also break a new avenue for future therapeutics.

DGlyTACs can specifically remove N-glycans from various target proteins on different cells. This strategy is not limited by proteins or cell types, specifically for exploring the importance of the N-glycans on glycoproteins, aiding in the development of more practical antibody-enzyme conjugates for targeted therapies.

In tumor immunity, T cells and macrophages both play pivotal roles, but their functions and effects are distinct. T cells are central to tumor immunotherapy, being directly involved in the recognition and elimination of tumor cells. The function of T cells is particularly critical in ICI therapy, making them a focal point in tumor immunity.35Consequently, we have been investigating the impact of N-glycosylation modifications on ICs and their influence on T cell function.

It has been reported that tumor cells evade immune surveillance by altering glycosylation patterns of their surface proteins.36Glycosylation is crucial for the associations between immune ligands and their corresponding receptors.36To enhance immune efficiency toward tumors, related researches were conducted through compromising the recognition of surface structures dominated by their glycosylation on tumor cells, which were already evidenced by a reduction in tumor escape via application of counteracting antibodies specifically directed to glycosylation complex.36It is well-established that N-glycosylation is required for the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1.15The PD-L1, a famous immune inhibitory ligand in cancer cell, exhibited a most significant loss in receptor binding after its de-N-glycosylation.15Thus, we focused on protein-specific de-N-glycosylation for PD-L1, in which human PD-L1 nanobody (nbhPDL1) and mouse PD-L1 nanobody (nbmPDL1) were utilized to generate DGlyTACs nbhPDL1-PNGF and nbmPDL1-PNGF.37A significant reduction in the molecular weight of PD-L1 were observed in the presence of nbhPDL1-PNGF or nbmPDL1-PNGF (Fig.3a–c, Supplementary Fig.4a–c, g). Complete de-N-glycosylation or nearly complete de-N-glycosylation was observed (Fig.3a–c, Supplementary Fig.3nand5a–c). Nevertheless, PNGF seemed ineffective for human PD-L1 de-N-glycosylation (Fig.3a). Probing for N-glycosylation on PD-L1 following immunoprecipitation, we revealed that nbhPDL1-PNGF removed nearly all N-glycans of PD-L1 while PNGF or nbhPDL1-PNGF-E206K was not (Supplementary Fig.4d). Treatment of nbhPDL1-PNGF had a negligible effect on global cellular N-glycosylation level (Supplementary Fig.4d–e).

The scale bars in the lower left corner of the image represent 50 μm.nThe representative flow cytometry presents the PD-L1 level after the same treatment as m

NbPDL1-PNGF share the same binding sites as PD-1 and thus blocking the PD-1 and PD-L1 interaction (Fig.3d). We then assessed the stability of PD-L1 by cycloheximide (CHX, MedChemExpress, Cat# HY-12320) treatment, which can distort measurements of protein translation efficiency,38combined with de-N-glycosylation of PD-L1 by nbhPDL1-PNGF. Our data showed that de-N-glycosylation had no effect on the stability of PD-L1 (Fig.3e–i). To further confirm whether the cell membrane stability (that present the half-life period of membrane proteins to be degraded in the lysosomal pathway) of PD-L1 depends on N-glycosylation, confocal imaging and flow cytometry were conducted and showed little change in PD-L1 protein level on the membrane of E0771 cells with or without nbmPDL1-PNGF (Fig.3m, n). Next, we tested whether de-N-glycosylated PD-L1 could also bind to PD-1. In comparison with the PBS as control, PNGF did not prevent PD-L1 from its association with PD-1 (Fig.3j–l). In contrast, DGlyTAC nbhPDL1-PNGF exhibited a significant disturbance on PD-L1/PD-1 binding in a dose-dependent manner, which was much better to that of the inhibitor competitor nbhPDL1-PNGF-E206K (Fig.3j–l). As data shown in Fig.3k, l, nbhPDL1-PNGF markedly decrease the binding between PD-1 and PD-L1 ( ~ 16-fold) at 50 nM, but it was only about 2.5-fold when treated with nbhPDL1-PNGF-E206K at the same concentration.

In conclusion, DGlyTAC nbhPDL1-PNGF can act as a PD-L1 specific glycosidase, which erase the N-glycans on PD-L1 as well as its binding to PD-1. Our results also showed that DGlyTAC does not influence the cell membrane stability of PD-L1, as well the expression rate of PD-L1. Such dual actions make DGlyTAC nbhPDL1-PNGF not only effectively eliminate the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1, but also present a longer therapeutic effect than inhibitors.

Since nbPDL1-PNGF inhibits the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1 irreversibly and thus controls T cell activation, we then evaluated the nbmPDL1-PNGF antitumor activity in vivo. To confirm the prevention of nbmPDL1-PNGF in tumor growth, we engrafted C57BL/6 mice with E0771 cells to induce tumors. When the tumor size reached 4 × 5 mm2PNGF, nbmPDL1-PNGF, mouse PD-1 antibody (abPD-1) or nbmPDL1 was delivered via intraperitoneal injection (Fig.4a). Treatment of nbmPDL1 was a bit slower in tumor growth compared with PBS control; moreover, treatment with nbmPDL1-PNGF and abPD-1 markedly diminished tumor growth (Fig.4b, c, e). While, the treatments had no effect on body weights (Fig.4d, Supplementary Fig.5e), suggesting there is no therapy-induced autoimmune disease. Next, we characterized the subgroups of intratumoral immune cells after treatment. As shown in Fig.4g–l, a breakdown of CD45+ immune cells together with a detailed comparison of T cells were observed. Consistent with a potent immune activation and antitumorigenic activity of intratumoral T cells, we found evident immune deviation of CD8+ TILs and CD4+ TILs upon treatment of nbmPDL1-PNGF and abPD-1. Particularly in the subtype of E0771 triple-negative breast cancer, an increased immune infiltration was noted which represents better therapeutic responsiveness and improved survival chances (Fig.4f).

E0771 cells were injected subcutaneously in the mammary pad of C57BL/6 mice. Drugs were administrated from day 7, at which point the tumors were ∼20 mm25 mg/kg PNGF, nbmPDL1-PNGF, abPD-1 or nbmPDL1 was delivered via intraperitoneal injection every 2 days for 3 times, and PBS was used as a vehicle.bComparison of dissected tumors after different treatments at day 15.cTumor volume comparison at day 7, 9, 11, 13, 15.dMouse weight comparison at day 7, 9, 11, 13, 15.eTumor weight comparison of dissected tumors at day 15.fSurvival curves for mice with different treatments (same asa).g,I,kSingle-cell suspensions from E0771 tumors were stained for tumor-infiltrating CD4 and CD8 T cells as well as macrophage cells, and then determined by FACS.

(The box and error bars represent the mean ± SEM.n≥ 6 mice per group, and a representative data was shown; ‘NS’ means not significant; ‘*’ meansp< 0.05; ‘**’ meansp< 0.01; ‘***’ meansp< 0.001)

Similar results were obtained in 4T1 (another triple-negative breast cancer cell line) tumor model, when PNGF, nbmPDL1-PNGF or nbmPDL1-PNGF-E206K was delivered via peri-tumoral injection every 3 days (Supplementary Fig.5a). Mice with nbmPDL1-PNGF treatment underwent much slower tumor growth than that of control mice or nbmPDL1-PNGF-E206K treatment (Supplementary Fig.5b–d). Same results were recapitulated in triple negative breast cancer in which 4th mammary glands were engrafted and evidenced by immunohistochemical staining with a monoclonal antibody against Ki-67 (Supplementary Fig.5f, g). Thus, nbmPDL1-PNGF exhibited better therapeutic efficacy than PNGF and nbmPDL1-PNGF-E206K in immune-uncompromised mice model, suggesting a potential role of nbmPDL1-PNGF in cancer immunotherapeutics.

DGlyTAC nbmPDL1-PNGF shows much better effect than the inhibitor competitor nbmPDL1 in vivo, effectively inhibiting tumor growth and promoting the infiltration of immune cells. Indeed, nbmPDL1-PNGF has a similar efficacy to abPD-1, a better PD-L1/PD-1 interaction inhibitor than nbmPDL1. The frequent co-expression of PD-L2 on cells (like E0771 here) (Supplementary Fig.4f) makes abPD-1 a better therapy over PD-L1 antibody (abPD-L1), since PD-L2 has much higher affinity for PD-1 than PD-L1.39

MC38 cell line, a well-characterized model for colorectal cancer, was chosen to represent the therapeutic potential of DGlyTAC nbmPDL1-PNGF among various cancer types. MC38 had a minimal expression of PD-L2 (data not shown) to exhibit the best efficacy. We engrafted C57BL/6 mice with MC38 cells to form solid tumors. When the tumor size reached 4 × 5 mm2, 4 mg/kg (Fig.5a–d) or 5 mg/kg (Fig.5e–h) PNGF, nbmPDL1-PNGF, mouse abPD-L1 or nbmPDL1 was delivered via intraperitoneal injection 3 times. Inter-group comparison revealed an optimal effect of DGlyTAC nbmPDL1-PNGF in tumor growth inhibition (Fig.5a–c, e–g). Indeed, DGlyTAC showed obvious improvement over abPD-L1 in 5 mg/kg dosage (Fig.5f).

The glycosylation of PD-L1 can control its immunosuppressive function. In order to compare the inhibitory efficiency of an already marketed PD-1 inhibitor (Tislelizumab) and nbhPDL1-PNGF, we evaluated T cell responses by measuring apoptotic tumor cells co-cultured with primary human T cells (Supplementary Fig.5h). In terms of enhancing the cytotoxicity of T cells, nbhPDL1-PNGF had better efficacy compared to Tislelizumab. In summary, the co-culture experiment of tumor cells and T cells provides us with an in vitro platform that simulates the in vivo environment, allowing us to compare the effects of different inhibitors and DGlyTACs on immunotherapy. We provide a comprehensive analysis that to understand the potential advantages or unique characteristics of nbhPDL1-PNGF.

PD-1 antibodies, well-established ICIs, are primarily used to treat various types of cancers. Although they effectively promote immuno-responses against cancer, immune reaction in normal tissues were also intrigued by PD-1 antibodies with associated organ toxicity.40Similarly, we next clarified how the DGlyTAC nbmPDL1-PNGF was transported to different tissues, its retention in these tissues, and the toxicity in these tissues. Its distribution is crucial for evaluating the efficacy and safety of nbPDL1-PNGF as drugs in cancer treatment.

In the MC38 mouse model, both H&E and TUNEL stainings showed that nbmPDL1-PNGF did not change histologically in heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney tissues (Fig.5i, j), accompanied by normal hematological parametric till the end of our study including hemoglobin levels plus different blood cell counts (Supplementary Fig.6a). All these data showed no significant organ toxicity of DGlyTAC nbPDL1-PNGF, same as abPD-L1.

Then, we examined the expression of PD-L1 in various organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney and tumor) isolated from MC38-bearing mice. Heart, liver, spleen, lung and tumor except kidney have certain amounts of PD-L1 expression (Fig.6a, b, Supplementary Fig.7a–d). To verify the clinical application potential of nbmPDL1-PNGF, its bio-distribution was tested by IVIS imaging system in animal model. FITC labeled PNGF, nbmPDL1-PNGF, abPD-L1 or nbmPDL1 was intraperitoneal injected into the MC38-bearing mice. About 40%–60% of the injected dose could be detected in tumors that are highly expressing PD-L1 (Fig.6c, d, Supplementary Fig.7e). We also found that nbmPDL1-PNGF, abPD-L1 and nbmPDL1 abundantly distributed in the liver, lung and kidney (Fig.6c, d, Supplementary Fig.7e). In addition, very few de-N-glycosylation was observed in the heart, spleen and kidney; and although nbmPDL1-PNGF were distributed in various organs (liver, lung and tumor), the highest and nearly complete de-N-glycosylation efficiency of nbmPDL1-PNGF was detected in tumors (Fig.6e, f, Supplementary Fig.6b–g). Only lung exhibited a bit de-N-glycosylation with DGlyTAC nbmPDL1-PNGF, so we may predict the highest clinical toxicity will come from lung; and much lower toxicity towards liver and nearly none for other organs. While, abPD-L1 and abPD-1 both show high clinical toxicity toward lung, liver and kidney.40The accumulation of DGlyTAC in the heart and spleen is minimal. Although DGlyTAC is enriched in the liver and kidneys, no significant de-N-glycosylation was observed (Fig.6e). Furthermore, the expression levels and glycosylation states of PD-L1 in these organs are relatively low. As a result, the enrichment of DGlyTAC in the liver and kidneys may not be solely due to its binding with PD-L1, but could also stem from conventional protein metabolic processes.

Normally mPD-L1 has 4 ~ 5 N-glycans modified in vivo. For quantification of de-N-glycosylation efficiency, we regard mPD-L1 with 4 ~ 5 N-glycans modification as ‘Full-glycosylated’, and mPD-L1 with < 4 N-glycans modification as ‘Deglycosylated’. So the de-N-glycosylation efficiency is calculated as the ratio of the ‘Deglycosylated’ portion.fQuantification of PD-L1 de-N-glycosylation efficiency calculated from (e).

In this study, we evaluated the potential of non-pathogenic nbPDL1-PNGF for tumor-targeting therapy. Our data showed that it could colonize solid tumors efficiently. Moreover, this is the first attempt to use DGlyTAC nbPDL1-PNGF as a tumor-targeting N-glycosidase to significantly restrain the growth of tumors. We conclude that DGlyTAC nbPDL1-PNGF can be a better therapy than abPD-L1 (Fig.5) while maybe with lower toxicity (Fig.6).

We have indicated the generality of DGlyTACs using four nanobodies and three affibodies directed against seven protein targets representing a wide range of N-glycosylated substrates. Our project creates a universal strategy for enzyme engineering to specifically remove the N-glycans of glycoproteins on the surface of living cells (Fig.7, FigureDraw ID: STITY8cf46). We have chosen PNGF from Flavobacterium meningosepticum, which is an enzyme widely used in protein glycosylation research. It can specifically hydrolyze N-linked oligosaccharides on glycoproteins or glycopeptides, thereby releasing intact N-glycan chains.16When DGlyTACs are applied alternately to the target proteins, they do not interfere with the N-glycosylation modifications of non-target proteins, showing perfect orthogonality (Supplementary Fig.8b-c). So this design is guided by in situ N-glycan removal of target proteins while minimally affecting other cell surface N-glycosylated proteins. The DGlyTACs enable the specific de-N-glycosylation of a protein of interest in cells and complements chemical and genetic methods to perturb N-glycosylated levels of targets. DGlyTACs are tailored for the targeted inactivation of membrane proteins through the specific erasing of N-glycans. Finally, we applied the system to characterize the importance of N-glycans to target proteins in the context of cellular biological functions and tumor immunotherapy. PNGF does possess immunogenicity in humans or mice. However, mice do not exhibit acute immune responses.



Design and development of a DGlyTAC to remove N-glycans in a protein-specific manner. The Nb/Af is able to recognize target protein and let PNGF to erase the N-glycans. The enhanced de-glycosylation effect was achieved by the recruitment of PNGF with an N-terminal Nb/Af against target protein. In the meanwhile, a stiff α-helical linker with the sequence of A(EAAAK)nA (n= 4) was introduced between Nb/Af and PNGF. The design is guided by in situ N-glycan removal of target proteins without affecting other N-glycoproteins, and is used to realize the research of biological functions and related molecular mechanisms based on N-glycans. The target proteins used in this study were eGFP-CD24, CD47, IGF1R, PD-L1, EGFR and HER2. The corresponding Nb/Afs were nbGFP, nbCD47, afIGF1R, nbPD-L1, afEGFR and afHER2. (FigureDraw ID: STITY8cf46)

It is well-known that PROTACs are designed to selectively degrade target proteins by exploiting the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway within cells. Upon entering a cell, PROTAC molecules function as molecular bridges that bring the target protein into close proximity with an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This interaction facilitates the ubiquitination of the target protein, marking it for recognition and subsequent degradation by the proteasome.41For this mechanism to be effective, PROTACs must be able to traverse the cell membrane; thus, their design must prioritize optimizing cell permeability to ensure efficient intracellular access and functional activity. LYTAC technology, an innovative approach for targeted protein degradation, exhibits considerable potential for the specific degradation of extracellular and membrane proteins. This method operates through the engagement of cell surface lysosomal targeting receptors (LTRs), such as CI-M6PR or ASGPR, which facilitate the endocytosis and subsequent lysosomal degradation of the target proteins.42Consequently, the efficacy of LYTACs is inherently dependent on the expression levels and distribution of these receptors, which can limit their overall effectiveness and applicability. DGlyTACs share conceptual parallels with targeted protein degradation strategies such as PROTACs and LYTACs, yet it operates independently the presence of degradation-associated proteins (such as E3 ligases and ASGPR), sharing the same targets and clinical indications as antibody inhibitors. Similar to PROTACs and LYTACs, the DGlyTACs works in an irreversible and recyclable manner, enabling protein inactivation at a lower concentration over inhibitors. Moreover, DGlyTACs are of rapid action (at least as less as 2 h) and long effect (~24 h even after DGlyTACs were swept out), making it a good candidate as the next generation antibody-related drugs. The maximal recycling capacity of DGlyTACs is the same as the total turnover number of the enzyme PNGF, which could be enhanced using enzymatic directed evolution.

The DGlyTACs we designed and the antibody-sialidase conjugates previously developed by Carolyn R. Bertozzi can both be utilized for cancer immunotherapy.43Nonetheless, there exist distinct disparities in their practical applications. Primarily, their drug targets are different: DGlyTACs engage in protein-specific deglycosylation (wherein the target protein constitutes the drug target), whereas the antibody-sialidase conjugates execute cell-specific desialylation (with sialic acids serving as the drug target). Secondly, the efficacy of the antibody-sialidase conjugates necessitates a sufficiently high expression level of the target protein; conversely, DGlyTACs merely require that the N-glycosylation of target proteins possesses biological functionality. Additionally, their construction methodologies are different: DGlyTACs incorporate a fixed linker, ensuring that, upon binding of the nanobody to the target protein, the distance between the target protein and the enzyme approximates 4 nm, thereby enabling PNGF to act exclusively on the target protein. In contrast, within the antibody-sialidase conjugates, the distance between the target protein and the enzyme remains indeterminate (e.g., 4–10 nm), permitting the sialidases to affect not only the target protein but also neighboring proteins. Furthermore, to effectuate the removal of sialic acid modifications across the entire cell, the antibody-sialidase conjugates demands a higher concentration for its operation (specifically exceeding 10 nM); whereas low concentration of DGlyTACs (no more than 5 nM) exhibits high efficacy alongside low toxicity.

The advantages of protein therapeutics lie in their high specificity and biological activity, enabling precise modulation and intervention in specific biological processes. They have a broad therapeutic range, applicable to various diseases, and possess the potential to quickly respond to clinical needs.44As a promising protein therapeutic, DGlyTACs achieve protein inactivation by removing N-glycans from target proteins in situ. Because not all N-glycosylation modifications exhibit clearly defined biological functions,45the comprehensive functional study of these N-glycosylation is of great urgency before applying DGlyTACs to a series of target proteins and subsequent clinical trials. Fortunately, DGlyTAC technique itself is an in situ tool to study the functions of N-glycans on target proteins, facilitating the research and therapeutic application at the same time. In future, large numbers of DGlyTACs will be made for specific studies on the function of N-glycans and subsequent potential therapeutics, creating a new era for glycobiology and glycoproteins as drug targets.

In summary, we have developed a method using Nb/Af to target and inactivate extracellular and membrane-associated glycoproteins, which we refer to as DGlyTAC. The DGlyTAC platform can directly target glycoproteins, promoting the removal of N-glycans, thereby effectively inactivating the target proteins. We have showed that DGlyTACs exhibit good target specificity and potent immunotherapeutic capacity with ICs as targets. Like antibody drugs, the off-target organ toxicity will be the greatest challenge for further translational applications for the non-specific expression of target proteins on tumors. We anticipate that the tunability and modularity of DGlyTACs will provide new opportunities for protein drug designs and maybe avoiding some side effects, enabling target protein de-N-glycosylation for both research and potential therapeutic applications.

For electrophoresis, 40 µg of protein samples were loaded into 10% or 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE), and transferred onto the 0.22 μm/0.45 μm polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore). After protein transfer, the membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) skimmed milk in PBST buffer for 2 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. We incubated the membranes overnight at 4 °C with a primary antibody solution (5% BSA or 5% PBST). After incubation with primary antibodies, the membranes were washed with PBST buffer for 3 times at room temperature with gentle shaking. The membranes were then incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG antibodies (1:30000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the membranes were washed again with PBST buffer for 3 times (each for 10 min) at room temperature with gentle shaking. Western blot bands were detected with a substrate that emits electro-chemiluminescence (ECL) (ShareBio, Cat# SB-WB012).

An IP assay was carried out to investigate the interaction between glycosylation and the target protein. Briefly, total proteins of the CHO-CD24 cells were extracted with ice-cold low-salt lysis buffer, and then the cell lysate was incubated with the eGFP antibody overnight on a turning wheel at 4 °C. The MilliporeSigma Protein A/G Mix Magnetic Bead System (Cat#LSKAGAG10) was used to purify the co-IP complex, and the low salt lysis buffer was used to wash the beads. Then the co-IP complex was separated into two samples, one for eGFP-CD24 western blot and the other for ConA -based streptavidin blotting.

For PD-L1, total proteins of the MDA-MB231 were extracted with ice-cold low-salt lysis buffer, and then the cell lysate was incubated with the PD-L1 antibody overnight on a turning wheel at 4 °C. The MilliporeSigma Protein A/G Mix Magnetic Bead System (Cat#LSKAGAG10) was used to purify the co-IP complex, and the low salt lysis buffer was used to wash the beads. Then the co-IP complex was separated into two samples, one for PD-L1 western blot and the other for Fucosyltransferase-based streptavidin blotting.

We transfected pcDNA3.1-eGFP-CD24 or pcCDH-H2-K1 plasmid into CHO cells (termed CHO-CD24 or CHO-H2-K1) which lack of CD24 or H2-K1expression. After co-incubation of cells with enzymes at 37 °C for 2 h, cells were dissolved in lysis buffer at a fivefold volume (4% SDS), followed by ultrasonication for 5 min and centrifugation at 12,000 g and 18 °C for 30 min to obtain the protein extracts. Subsequently, six volumes of acetone were added to precipitate the proteins at −20 °C overnight. The precipitates were redissolved after 5 minutes of ultrasonication, and then diluted tenfold with 100 mM NH4HCO3. The concentration of proteins was measured using the BCA method. Next, the proteins were reduced in 10 mM TCEP at 57 °C for 30 min, and subsequently alkylated in the dark with 20 mM IAA at room temperature for 30 minutes. After that, the proteins were digested into peptides by incubating them with trypsin at a final enzyme - to - substrate ratio of 1:50 at 37 °C overnight. The resulting peptides were desalted using Sep - Pak C18 cartridges (Waters, USA). Finally, the desalted peptides were dried by vacuum centrifugation and then employed for glycopeptide enrichment. Glycopeptides were enriched by zwitterionic hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (ZIC-HILIC) method. Briefly, the desalted peptides of 1 mg were resuspended in 300 μL loading buffer containing 80% ACN and 1% TFA and then loaded onto a homemade micro-column containing 50 mg of ZIC-HILIC particles (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) packed onto a C8 disk. The flow-through was collected and reloaded onto the column for additional four times. Then, the column was washed with 200 μL loading buffer for four times, and finally eluted with 140 μL 0.1% TFA. The elution was collected and lyophilized.

Glycopeptide analysis was conducted using an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) in conjunction with an EASY-nano-LC system (Thermo Scientific) without the trap column. Samples were loaded onto a C18 spray tip column (50 cm × 75 µm i.d.) and separated at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The mobile phase consisted of Solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and Solvent B (acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid), with a gradient elution profile: 5% B increasing to 35% B over 345 min, followed by a 5-minute ramp to 90% B, and holding at 90% B for an additional 10 min.

For glycopeptide analysis, the MS parameters were set as follows: scan range from 800 to 2000 m/z, resolution of 120,000, AGC target of 200,000, maximum injection time of 100 ms, and inclusion of charge states from 2 to 6. Dynamic exclusion was enabled after one occurrence, with an exclusion duration of 15 s. Each selected precursor ion was subjected to one HCD-MS/MS event.

The HCD-MS/MS settings included an isolation window of 4 m/z, detection by the Orbitrap, resolution of 15,000, AGC target of 500,000, maximum injection time of 250 ms, and collision energy of 30%. Stepped collision mode was activated with an energy difference of +10%, where 10% represents the absolute value in the Orbitrap Fusion.

In this study, we employed a straightforward method for detecting glycans with ConA-based streptavidin blotting. Concanavalin A (ConA) is a lectin that specifically binds to α-D-mannose and α-D-glucose residues. By conjugating ConA with biotin, it can be detected using streptavidin-conjugated enzymes, which allows for sensitive and specific detection of mannose in samples. Add 2 μg/mL of ConA-biotin to the cell sample. Incubate at room temperature for 1−2 h to allow ConA-biotin to bind to mannose residues. Remove unbound ConA-biotin by washing the plate with PBS for 3 times. The protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated for another 30 min to allow binding of the streptavidin-HRP to the biotinylated ConA. Finally, the membranes were washed again with PBST buffer for 3 times (each for 10 min) at room temperature with gentle shaking. Western blot bands were detected with a substrate that emits electro-chemiluminescence (ECL).

For enrichment and identification of N-glycosylation proteins, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and re-suspended in buffer containing 1% SDS at a concentration of 1 mg/mL in a six-well plate. 50 µl suspensions obtained above were incubated with 50 μM CuSO4-BTTAA premixed complex (CuSO4-BTTAA, molar ratio 1:2), 100 μM alkyne-Biotin, 100 μM UDP-FucAz, 40 μM FucT, and 2.5 mM fresh sodium ascorbate for click reaction at 37 °C for 30 min. Remove unbound mixture by washing the plate with PBS for 3 times. The protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with streptavidin-HRP for another 30 min. Finally, the membranes were washed again with PBST buffer for 3 times (each for 10 min) at room temperature with gentle shaking. Western blot bands were detected with a substrate that emits electro-chemiluminescence (ECL).

Replate CHO-CD24 cells onto a 12-well plate, add concentration gradients P-3Fax-Neu5ac (50 μM, 100 μM, 200 μM, and 400 μM) for 24 h, then add Ac4ManNAz (200 μM/well), and treat for another 48 h. Transfer cells to 1.5 ml EP tubes, and wash with PBS twice. 50 µl suspensions obtained above were incubated with 50 μM CuSO4-BTTAA premixed complex (CuSO4-BTTAA, molar ratio 1:2), 100 μM alkyne-Biotin, 100 μM UDP-FucAz, 40 μM FucT, and 2.5 mM fresh sodium ascorbate for click reaction at 37 °C for 30 min. After being incubated with cy5-streptavidin for another 30 min, the cellular sialic acid was analyzed by flow cytometry.

The expression plasmid pCDNA3.1-eGFP-CD24 was constructed by cloning the fused fragment of signal peptide of CD24, eGFP, and encoding CD24 sequence into the pcDNA3.1 vector.

The expression plasmid pET21a-NbGFP-PNGF was constructed by fusing eGFP nanobody, linker, and PNGF. The plasmids pET28a-PNGF, pET21a-NbGFP-PNGF, pET21a-NbCD47-PNGF, pET28a-NbhPdL1-PNGF, pET28a-NbmPdL1-PNGF, pET28a-NbmPdL1, pET28a-AfIGF1R-PNGF, pET21a-AfEGFR-PNGF and pET21a-AfHER2-PNGF were constructed in a similar way. All constructed protein sequences were codon optimized for expression inEscherichia coli, synthesized in Sangon Bioengineering (Shanghai), and inserted into pET21a / pET28a plasmid using seamless ligation (between XbaI site and 6xHis-Tag). These plasmid sequences were listed in Supplementary ‘DNA sequence of plasmids’.

In parallel, the plasmids for the enzyme PNGF, which is completely inactive, were generated by mutating PNGF at catalytic residue 206 from glutamic acid to lysine, and the corresponding primers were used to perform site-directed mutagenesis on each vector in order to obtain pET21a-NbGFP-PNGF-E206K, pET21a-NbCD47-PNGF-E206K, pET28a-NbhPdL1-PNGF-E206K and pET28a-NbmPdL1-PNGF-E206K.

Plasmid pET21a-NbGFP-PNGF was transformed into BL21(DE3) competent cells. For expression of NbGFP-PNGF, transformed bacteria were cultured at 37 °C in 2×TB media with 100 μg/mL ampicillin and induced with 1 mM IPTG at 20 °C when OD600 reached 0.8 ~ 1.2. After induction of expression at 20 °C for 24 h, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. After re-suspending the pellets in PBS buffer five mL per gram of wet weight, the cell suspension was sonicated for 20 minutes in an ice-water bath. After the centrifugation at 20,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was loaded into a Ni-NTA column. The columns were washed with wash buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole) for 10 columns. The protein was then eluted with elution buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 500 mM imidazole). Purified proteins were then dialyzed into PBS at 4 °C for 3 times (each for 4 h). Other proteins, NbGFP-PNGF-E206K, NbCD47-PNGF, NbCD47-PNGF-E206K, NbhPDL1-PNGF, NbhPDL1-PNGF-E206K, NbmPDL1-PNGF, NbmPDL1-PNGF-E206K, PNGF, AfIGF1R-PNGF, AfEGFR-PNGF, AfHER2-PNGF and NbmPDL1 were expressed and purified in a similar way. In Supplementary Fig.8a, SDS-PAGE result indicating the production and purity of all the recombinant proteins.

To measure PD-1 and PD-L1 protein interaction, we treated MDA-MB231 with 5 nM PNGF, nbhPDL1-PNGF, and nbhPDL1-PNGF-E206K in a humidified incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO2for 24 h. After washing cells with PBS buffer for 30 minutes at room temperature with gentle shaking, we incubated them with recombinant human PD-1 Fc chimera for 2 hours. The biotin labeled antibody goat anti-human IgG Fc was used at 4 °C overnight. The secondary antibody used here was anti-biotin Cy5 dye conjugate streptavidin. Flow cytometry measured PD-1 binding on the membrane of MDA-MB231 cells expressing PD-L1. We used a similar method to measure the interaction between CD24 and Siglec-10. Before the cells were incubated with recombinant human Siglec-10 Fc chimera, the bound PNGF, nbGFP-PNGF, and nbGFP-PNGF-E206K were dissociated in acidic buffer (100 mM Glycine, 150 mM NaCl, pH 3.0 containing 0.1% Tween-20) for 2 min.

Upon alignment in PyMOL, the structures of PDB 4zqk (binding of PD-L1 to PD-1) and PDB 5jds (binding of PD-L1 to nbhPD-L1) are obtained. PD-L1 is depicted in white and green, PD-1 in pink, and nbhPD-L1 in blue. The findings indicate that PD-1 and nbhPD-L1 utilize the same binding site on PD-L1.

Eight-week-old C57BL/6 wild-type mice were acquired from Shanghai Slaccas Laboratory Animal Company Limited. In order to obtain bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM), femurs and tibias were perfused with ice-cold phosphate - buffered saline (PBS), and red blood cells were lysed by red blood cell lysis buffer. Subsequently, bone marrow cells were cultivated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin in the presence of 50 ng/mL murine macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) (PeproTech), 0.1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco, Cat# 11360-70) and 10 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N’-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (Gibco, Cat# 15630-080) for seven days.

Macrophages were plated 1 × 10^5 cells per well in a 48-well plate in complete DMEM medium, cancer cells were stained with Calcein, AM (Yeasen, China) at 37 °C for 10 min. Each phagocytosis reaction reported in this work was performed by co-culture of target cells and macrophages for 4 h at 37 °C. Macrophages were identified with APC-labeled anti-F4/80 (Biolegend, Cat. # 123116), and flow cytometry (BD FACSCanto II, San Jose, CA) was performed. Cytochalasin D were purchase from MCE (HY-N6682). After the successful induction of mouse macrophages, they were treated with a concentration of 10 μM for 1 hour to inhibit cytoskeleton remodeling, and then CHO-CD24 cells were added to the cell culture dishes containing or without Cytochalasin D for phagocytosis experiments. Use flow cytometry to analyze cell phagocytic activity and observe the proportion of double-positive cells. Phagocytosis was calculated as the percentage of Calcein+F4/80+ cells (Q2) among Calcein+ cells (Q2 + Q3): phagocytosis (%) = [Q2 / (Q2 + Q3)] x100%.

In Kd screening, antibody or ligands were loaded into sensors using 20 nM solutions. A baseline was established in PBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA, followed by submersion of sensors in a single concentration of analyte in the assay buffer. The dissociation was monitored in fresh assay buffer during the dissociation process. A sensor shake rate of 1000 rotations per minute was used throughout all experiments. Using ForteBio’s data analysis software (Menlo Park, CA, USA), a 1:1 binding model was fitted to the data in order to calculate the association rate and dissociation rate. The ratio of kd : ka was used to calculate Kd. The antigen NbGFP-PNGF (10 nM) was pre-incubated at room temperature for one hour with a second antibody (10 nM) in a typical epitope binning assay. An AMC sensor (ForteBio) was loaded with a control antibody (20 nM). A mixture of second antibodies and antigens was pre-incubated on sensors. ForeBio Data Analysis Software 7.0 was used to process raw data and assess competitive binding between antibody pairs. Antibodies binding to additional epitopes indicate unoccupied epitopes (non-competitors), and no binding indicates epitope blocking (competitors).

In brief, paraffin sections were dewaxed, rinsed twice with absolute ethanol, and hydrated, and antigens were extracted according to the instructions (ZSGB-BIO, SP9000). After incubating for 10 min at room temperature with reagent 1, the slides were washed three times in PBS for 3 min each. Then sections were incubated in blocking solution (reagent 2) for 15 minutes, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with ki-67 antibody in an immunohistochemical wet box. The following day, sections were washed three times with PBS, incubated with reagent 3 at 37 °C for 30 min in a wet box, washed again with PBS, and then incubated with reagent 4 at 37 °C for 30 min. After being washed three times with PBS, immunolabeling was performed with 1x diaminobenzidine (DAB, ZSGB-BIO, Cat# ZLI-9018). Finally, the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin (Biosharp, China, Cat# BL702B).

E0771 cell was incubated with whole goat serum containing primary antibody against PD-L1 (Abcam, Cat#EPR20529) overnight at 4 °C. Then, the cells were incubated with biotin-labeled secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cat# 111-065-003) for an additional 20–30 min. At the same time, nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Beyotime, Cat# C1341M). The staining was observed under fuorescence microscopy.

An organ tissue sample from a mouse was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 12 h, then embedded in paraffin, cut into 4 µm slices, and mounted on a microscope slide. Following slide placement in a slide holder, two changes of xylene were used to dissolve paraffin, followed by sequential changes of 100, 95, and 70% ethanol for rehydration. Hematoxylin was applied to the slides and incubated at room temperature for eight minutes to stain the nuclei. Eosin staining was performed for 30 s after tissue samples were thoroughly washed with tap water and differentiated with 1% acid ethanol. A light microscope was used to acquire images of tissue samples.

An organ tissue sample from a mouse was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 12 h, then embedded in paraffin, cut into 4 µm slices, and mounted on a microscope slide. TUNEL staining was applied to the paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Fluorescence images of each tissue section were obtained and analyzed by ImageJ.

On harvest day, mice were euthanized, and tumors were mechanically dissociated and digested with deoxyribonuclease (10000 Kunitz/mL, Sigma, Cat# DN25/DN4527) and collagenase IV (Thermo, Cat# 17104019). After lysing red blood cells with lysing buffer, tumor cells were resuspended in FACS buffer. Tumor digests were filtered and resuspended as single cell suspensions. Cells were treated with Fc block (BD Pharmingen, Cat# 564219), then stained with Amcyan live/dead dye (Thermo Scientific Fisher, Cat#L10119). In order to analyze with flow cytometry, single-cell suspensions were prepared and stained with the indicated markers. For antibody staining, cells were washed with PBS containing 2% FBS, and stained on ice.

The antibodies used were CD45-Percp-Cy5.5 (BioLegend, Cat#103132), CD3-BV510 (BioLegend, Cat#100233), CD8-APC (BioLegend, Cat#100712), and CD4-APC (BioLegend, Cat#100553), CD11b-APC (BioLegend, Cat# 301310), F4/80-PE (BioLegend, Cat# 123109). Dead cells were excluded using the near-infrared dye (Invitrogen, Cat# 65-0865-14). Flow analysis was performed using BD FACS Canto II (San Jose, CA), and singlets were gated on using FSC-H versus FSC-A.

The biodistribution of antibodies was performed on C57BL/6 mice subcutaneously bearing MC38 tumors. The mice were intravenously injected with FITC-labeled PNGF, nbmPDL1-PNGF, abPD-L1, and nbmPDL1 (200 μl). The mice were sacrificed after 12 h, and their major organs were collected, including the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and tumor. In vivo imaging was performed using an in vivo imaging system (IVIS) under the same settings. The fluorescence intensity was measured using Living Image software.

The T cell-mediated tumor cell cytotoxicity assay was conducted in accordance with the adapted protocol provided by Essen Bioscience. In summary, to activate tumor-specific T cells, we incubated tumor cells together with anti-CD3 antibodies (proteintech, Cat# 65133-1-Ig) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) (MedChemExpress, Cat# HY-P7037B)-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells for a duration of 5 to 7 days. Subsequently, we isolated and expanded the T cell population employing the ImmunoCult Human CD3/CD28 T Cell Activator (Cell Signaling Technologies, Cat #70976). To analyze the killing of tumor cells by T cell, we co-cultured tumor cells which treated with different deglycosylases or Tislelizumab (MedChemExpress, Cat# HY-P99052). T cells, specifically cytotoxic T lymphocytes, identify and bind to tumor cells, subsequently releasing perforin and granzymes. These cytotoxic molecules induce apoptosis or necrosis in the target cells, resulting in cell lysis and the release of intracellular enzymes such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which can be measured as a biomarker of cytotoxic activity. Furthermore, the lactase dehydrogenase (LDH) assay (LDH cytotoxicity assay kit, Promega) was conducted using the culture medium to assess cellular damage.

Assistive devices like rollators help to reduce that risk, especially by compensating for decreased leg muscle strength and balance problems. Paradoxically, rollators have been found to be a fall risk as well as being difficult to use. To investigate the causes, this study examines how different levels of rollator support (no assistance, light touch, and full support) and balance demands (standard lab floor, balance pads) affect movement coordination during standing up and sitting down movements.<h4>Methods</h4>Twenty young participants stood up and sat down while full-body kinematics and muscle activity (30 channels) were recorded. Participants stood up and sat down using different movement strategies (e.g., forward leaning, hybrid, and vertical rise standing up movement strategies). For each movement strategy, spatial and temporal muscle synergies were extracted from the muscle activity patterns. Temporal muscle synergies provided a more compact, low-dimensional representation than spatial muscle synergies, so they were subsequently clustered with k-means++. The activation duration of the temporal muscle synergies was assessed with full-width at half-maximum at the main peak. Multivariate linear mixed models were used to investigate if the muscle weightings associated with the temporal muscle synergies differed across the support conditions.<h4>Results</h4>The timings of the temporal muscle synergy activations, but not the shape, differed across the movement strategies for both types of movement. Across all tasks, temporal muscle synergies showed a narrower width of activation around the time of seat-off and seat-on than at the movement start and end. No support-specific temporal muscle synergies were found, but lower limb muscle weightings decreased while upper-limb muscle weightings increased with increased support.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The narrow shape of the temporal synergy activation profiles suggests that the central nervous system controls the movements tightly, especially around seat-off and seat-on and in challenging conditions with increased balance demands. Furthermore, rollator support increases the weightings of upper body and decreases the weightings of lower limb muscles, especially around seat-off and seat-on.

Meanwhile, the RFSN treatment increased DOC by 51.1% (53.2%), EOC by 25.4 % (26.1%), MBC by 96.3% (80.8%), MBN by 52.6% (86.7%) in 2020 (2021), respectively.

As a result, gray relation analysis and entropy TOPSIS model evaluated that application of maize straw 1.5 t ha-1and chemical nitrogen fertilizer of 180 kg ha-1in ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting system (RFSN) serve as a effective method of soil management to enhance water and nitrogen utilization, potentially boosting yields and promoting resource efficiency in the arid regions of the Loess Plateau.

Agriculture faced unprecedented challenges as global climate change intensifies and water resources continue to diminish [1]. Arid lands occupied nearly half of the earth's land, which makeing dryland agriculture increasingly crucial [2]. Dryland farming must overcome natural environmental challenges and address the growing pressure of food production to ensure stable global food supply. Low water availability and frequent drought stress occurs resulted in turn gravely threatens the food security of these areas owing to the high variability of rainfall in arid regions [3]. Therefore, improved water supply is crucial for stabilizing and increasing crop productivity.

Water scarcity is a critical global issue that limited agricultural productivity and financial growth in dry and semi-arid areas. Rain-fed agriculture is a important contributor to the cultivated land in China, accounting for 70% of the total land area [4]. The region experiences low and irregular seasonal precipitation, making crop water shortages extremely common. Moreover, the timing of precipitation not align with the water requirements of the growing crops, and water shortages and poor soil conditions severely restrict agricultural productivity and sustainability in the semi-arid regions of the Loess Plateau. Maize as one of the largest-planted and most economically valuable cereal crops in China, accounts for 41% of the total world grain production [5]. Despite the continuous introduction of higher yields and more adaptable maize varieties through breeding technologies, maize yield has still not fundamentally improved due to the influence of various factors such as water scarcity and soil infertility. Therefore, effective rainwater conservation measures and the improvement of water resource utilization planting patterns are crucial for local maize production and security.

The ridge and furrow rain harvesting (RFRH) system has great advantages in promoting crop productivity in dryland, and has emerged as one of the main water-saving irrigation planting patterns in arid regions of China [6]. The RHRF was altered the topography of the land surface, and augmented the area that receiving solar irradiation and curtailing the water exchange between the soil and atmosphere through the utilization of thin-film covering. This innovative approach not only addresses water scarcity but also creates a more favorable microenvironment for crop growth. Previous researches shown that the RFRH could collected surface runoff generated by rainfall and reduced ineffective evaporation, and improve soil water status in crop growing areas [7]. RHRF not only suppresses soil moisture evaporation but also directs rainfall into furrowed catchments via runoff to facilitated for crop growth in regions with substantial evapotranspiration, [8]. This system also had a runoff effect on the rainfall of 1mm, and increasing soil water storage in soil layer at all stages of crop growth. The main characteristics of RHRF are its soil warming and water replenishing effects. RHRF effectively reduced the latent heat flux and elevated the temperature at the soil surface. Previous studies have also indicated that the RHRF not only ameliorates soil thermal and moisture conditions but also enhances crop growth and development. The model provides excellent moisture support and create favorable conditions for crop photosynthesis, which significantly increased the photosynthetic rate more than 10-67% compared with the flat planting system [9]. RFRH is widely used by various types of plants, and therefore a critical planting system for ensuring food security in dryland growing area in the world.

Integrated nutrient management is vital in fortifying and refining the physicochemical characteristics of dryland soil, which is not only related to crop growth and soil fertility sustenance and augmentation, but also a pivotal measure for realizing agricultural circular economy and facilitated agricultural sustainable development. The application of crop straw and fertilizer plays an important role in integrated nutrient management. Crop straw, being a vastly accessible and directly exploitable renewable source of organic cellulose, and replete with carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and an array of trace elements [10]. Especially in crop straw is returned to the field, it can promote soil organic carbon sequestration, and then effectively improve soil chemical properties. Xu et al. [6] found that full or half corn straw could significantly increase soil organic carbon storage by 52.5% and 31.7%, respectively. Further research by wang et al. [11] indicated that straw restitution can improve the soil microhabitat by encouraging the development of soil aggregates, and augment the quantity of organic matter sequestered within these aggregates and microaggregates, and diminished the microbial decomposition of organic carbon and substantially increasing the carbon's stabilization in the soil. The strategic addition of straw has been shown to amplify soil fertility by elevating the levels of soil active organic carbon and enzymatic activity. Straw addition can improve soil fertility by increasing soil active organic carbon enzyme activity. Moreover, fertilization as plays a crucial role in enhancing food production and ensuring food security in dryland areas. In semi-arid regions, the application of 90 kg N ha of nitrogen fertilizer alone can result in a significant 109% increase in maize yields [12]. This increase is attributed to the low total nitrogen content of soils in the region. However, current grain yields heavily rely on excessive fertilizer application, raising environmental concerns. Effective nutrient management needs to consider soil type, crop demand, regional climate, and environmental protection,with its succes large dependent on soil moisture.

In recent years, the synergistic effect of integrating nutrient management and water availability has attracted significant attention. However, little is known about the combined impacts of the ridge and furrow rain harvesting (RFRH) system and integr ated nutrient management on resource use efficiency and yield potential. Field trials have not fully explored the inteplay between the RFRH system, crop straw, and nitrogen fertilizer. Further investigation is needed to assess whether the RFRH system could serve as an effective control measure and how it could be integrated with nutrient management to optimize agricultural production and enhance crop water-nitrogen use efficiency.

Previous studies have focused on the individual effects of RFRH [13] or RFRH with fertilizer [14] or biochar [15] on soil nutrition, economic benefits of ecosystems, and crop productivity. It is first time to research whether RHRF combining these factors can improve soil fertility and yield benefits in dryland areas. Therefore, we hypothesize that combining straw and nitrogen fertilizer under RFRH system could enhance maize yield and water-nitrogen use efficiencies simultaneously. The integrated approach aims to maximize resource utilization while promoting sustainability. The purpose of this study was to explore (i) to compare the interaction effects of different planting patterns coupled with integrated nutrient management on soil temperature, soil moisture dynamics, yield, biomass, harvest index, grain and straw N content, plant N uptake, water productivity (WP), nitrogen uptake use efficiency (NUPE), agronomy efficiency (AE) and partial factor productivity of nitrogen (PFPN) and soil C/N fractions; (ii) analyze the relationship between soil hydrothermal characteristics, yield components, water and nitrogen productivity and soil organic carbon fractions; and (ii) determine which as optimized cultivation practice for improving soil environment and maize production on the Plateau. We hypothesized that the ridge and furrow rain harvesting planting combined with the utilization of integrated nutrient management has the potential to beneficial for soil hydrothermal to enhance the crop productivity, resource utilization efficiency. A comprehensive comprehension of the impact of soil environment on crop yield can serve as a theoretical foundation for maintaining soil fertility and attaining sustainable dryland agricultural development.

The experiment was conducted in 2020-2021 at the Farming experimental site (36°0'31"" N, 108°56'25"" E, 1057m above sea level) in Fuxian County, Yan 'an city, Shaanxi Province (Fig.1a). The region is a typical warm temperate continental monsoon climate, with an average annual temperature of 8.9℃, an average annual evaporation of 1050 mm, and a 40-year average precipitation (1980-2021) of 580 mm (Fig.1b). The annual rainfall generally lasts from April to early October. During the experiment period, precipitation fluctuated greatly. The total precipitation during the growing period of maize ranged from 472.5 mm to 506.2 mm, and the two-year average was 489.3 mm. The soil texture of the experiment site was yellow spongy soil, and the physicochemical properties of the surface soil (0-20 cm) before sowing were as follows: organic matter of 12.3 g kg-1, total nitrogen of 0.8 g kg-1, available phosphorus 6.51 mg kg-1, available potassium of 98.25 g kg-1, alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen of 114 mg kg-1, pH 7.6.

The field trial was conducted from April 2021 to October 2022 in a randomized complete block design with three replicates. The two planting patterns include (i) conventional flat planting (CP, Fig.2A); (ii) ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting (RF, Fig.2B). Both system with three nutrient management treatments (CK, control; N, only application nitrogen fertilizer rates of 180 kg ha-1; NS, application of maize straw 1.5 t ha-1and chemical nitrogen fertilizer of 180 kg ha-1). There were six treatments: conventional flat planting without nutrinet management (CP), ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting without nutrinet management (RF), conventional flat planting with only application nitrogen fertilizer rates of 180 kg ha-1(CPN), ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting with only application nitrogen fertilizer rates of 180 kg ha-1(RFN), conventional flat planting withapplication of maize straw 1.5 t ha-1and chemical nitrogen fertilizer of 180 kg ha-1(CPSN), conventional flat planting with application of maize straw 1.5 t ha-1and chemical nitrogen fertilizer of 180 kg ha-1(RFSN). The rates of chemical nitrogen fertilizer were urea (46%N ), and the rates of 150 kg ha-1N. The rates of P and K fertilization were 90 kg ha-1P and 120 kg ha-1K, which were calcium superphosphate (12% P) and potassium chloride (60% K), respectively. The maize straw was chopped (1-2 cm) were uniformly plowed into the soil layer (0-20 cm), and the soil was deposited by a rotary machine in October 2019. Before maize sowing period, the soil of 30cm was plowed, chemical fertilizer in CF, MS and MC treatments were applied into the soil as basal fertilizer, and the treatments in the ridge and furrow rain harvesting planting system were covered with plastic film. The RFRH system used ridge and furrow widths of 45 cm, which ridge height was 15 cm and the ridges were covered with ordinary transparent and impermeable plastic film (film width 80 cm and thickness 0.02 mm). The conventional flat planting system (Fig.2B) is not covered with film, which belongs to normal cultivation. Each plots had an area of 61.2 m2(17 m× 3.6 m). The spring maize variety ‘Liaodan 352′ was purchase in market and sown on on April 28, 2020 and April 29, 2021 and harvested on October 2, 2020 and October 5, 2021. Urea (46% N), calcium superphosphate (16% P), and potassium sulfate (50% K) were using a hole-sowing machine with a seeding depth of 5-6cm and harvested in late September or October each year, and remove the mulch after harvested. In the semiarid rain-fed region, no irrigation was provided over the course of two experimental years. To prevent maize yield loss, weeds, pests, and diseases are controlled using conventional local field management practices (insecticides and herbicides).



Field layouts of the conventional flat planting (A) and ridge-furrow rainwater harvesting system (B)

Ten plants were chosen randomly from each plot for biomass measurement during the seeding, jointing, tasseling, silking and pollination, filling, and harvesting stages. Initially, the plant components underwent dehydration at 105 °C for half an hour to suspend natural processes. Subsequently, they were subjected to further drying at 75°C until a stable weight was attained (ensuring the grain yield was normalized to 14% moisture content) and the weight of one thousand grains was documented.

Soil samples were collected from the 0-80cm soil layers in each plot at various growth stages: seeding, jointing, tasseling, silking, pollination, and filling, respectively. Samples were collected during the seeding stage and at 20-day intervals throughout the growing season. In cases of rainfall on the scheduled sampling day, the sampling was postponed by 3-5 days. Soil samples were taken in 10cm layers using a soil drill with a 4cm diameter. For the RFRH treatments, samples were taken from the middle of the ridges and furrows, as well as the sides of the furrows. In the flat planting treatments, soil cores were collected adjacent to the rows and between the rows. Samples collected were transported to the laboratory using ice bags at the base and weighed within 2 hours of collection to measure the wet weight. The soil water content (gravimetric, SWC) was then determined using the oven-drying method. Soil water storage (SWS, mm) were calculated by following formula [16]:

Where C was the soil water content (gravimetric, SWC, %) , BDiwas soil bulk density (g cm-3) and hirefers to as soil depth (mm), and i=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 represented the soil layer of 0-10cm, 10-20cm, 20-30cm, 30-40cm, 40-50cm, and 50-60cm.

Soil temperature (℃) was meticulously monitored between the roots of two maize plants within the same row in each plot by utilizing a mercury geothermometer. Throughout the period spanning from 2021 to 2022, soil temperature measurements were diligently conducted at seeding, jointing, tasseling, silking, filling, and maturity stages at 5-day intervals. The soil temperature at a depth of 10cm was observed at three-hour intervals from 9:00 am to 17:00 pm on the day. The resultant data was used to calculate daily average soil temperatures, comprising the mean values recorded at 9:00, 12:00, 15:00, and 18:00.

Above-ground plants are separated into root and crop residues, which include stems and leaves. The grain and straw samples were passed through a 0.5 mm sieve for grinding. The concentrations of nitrogen (N) are subsequently quantified during corn harvesting. The dried samples are individually processed through grinding and digestion using H2SO4-H2O2. The concentrations of nitrogenare determined using the Kjeldahl method. The total N uptake was calculated by dry weight multiplying the N concentration of each part.

WP (kg ha-1mm-1) were estimated as follows:

where CWP is the water productivity (kg ha-1mm-1), GY is the grain yield (kg ha-1), and ET is the evapotranspiration (mm).

N agronomic efficiency (AEN, kg kg-1) were calculated for each plot using the following equations:

Where YN is the grain yield in N fertilization treatments (kg ha-1), Y0 is the grain yield in without N fertilization (kg ha-1), F is the total amount of applied N (kg ha-1).

The Harvest index (HI, kg kg-1) was calculated as follow:

The uptake efficiencies for N (NUPE) were calculated using the following equations:

The partial factor productivity of N (PFPN) was calculated as follows:

Soil samples were collected after maize harvest in 2020 and 2021. Ten sampling points were randomly selected from each plot and collected with a soil auger. The soil collected from each plot was homogeneously mixed and the fresh soil samples were passed through a 2 mm sieve and divided into two portions. One portion was stored in a refrigerator at 4°C for subsequent analysis of soil for DOC, EOC, MBC, and MBN content. The samples were air-dried for the assessment of soil physico-chemical properties.

The soil was evenly mixed with deionized water (1:5) and shaken for 1 hour. The mixture was then passed through a 0.045um filter membrane to determine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) using a TOC-LCPH soil total carbon analyzer. Easily oxidizable organic carbon (EOC) was quantified through oxidation using 333 mmol L-1KMnO4repercussion method. Soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) was measured by the chloroform fumigation-abstraction method. Briefly, soil sample was subjected to ethanol-free chloroform fumigation for 24 h, and abstracted with K2SO4, and the MBC content was measured using a TOC-LCPH soil total carbon analyzer.

Gray correlation analysis is a method that assesses the geometric proximity of behavioral factor sequences using sample data from each indicator. It aims to determine the closeness, magnitude, and order of correlation between each indicator factor. When the original data is not uniform, it needs to be dimensionless processing to make the data comparable. The maximum value (X0) of each index parameter is taken as the reference data, and the absolute value of the difference between the dimensionless value of each index parameter and the dimensionless value of the reference sequence is processed.

Calculate the correlation coefficient by this formula:

Whichε1is the correlation coefficient of reference sequence and comparison sequence,miniminkΔikis second-order minimum difference,maximaxkΔikis Second order maximum difference, the resolution coefficientρis 0.5.

Calculation the correlation degree according to formula:

The entropy-weighted TOPSIS model aims to minimize the influence of subjective factors on evaluation outcomes and enhance model accuracy. The TOPSIS method is a multi-objective decision-making analysis technique for a limited number of scenarios. Its main objective is to identify the optimal and worst scenarios based on the normalized original data matrix. The method then calculates the distance between each evaluation scenario and the optimal and worst scenarios, respectively, to obtain the relative proximity of the evaluation scenarios to the optimal scenarios. This serves as a basis for evaluation. The modelling process is as follows.

Assuming a multi-indicator decision-making problem with n evaluation indicators and m programmes, the programme set and indicator set are denoted as M = (M1, M2, ..., Mn) and C = (C1, C2, ..., Cm) respectively. Xij(i = 1, 2, ..., n; j = 1, 2, ..., m) is the estimated value of indicator C for programme M.

Using the normalisation of the judgement matrix, the following formula was used for the larger and smaller indicators, respectively.

Transform the matrix into a normalised matrix by dimensionless processing Zij (i=1, 2, ..., m; j=1, 2, ...,n), and further determine the positive ideal solution vector Z+= (z+1, z+2, ..., z+n) and the negative ideal solution vector Z-= (z-1, z-2, ..., z-n) of the matrix Z.

Calculate the euclidean distance (Si+and Si-) of the evaluation programme from the positive and negative ideal solutions using the formula.

SPSS 25.0 was utilized for statistical analysis to compare variances and conduct the Least Significant Difference (LSD) test. This was done to assess disparities in temperature, soil water storage, crop yield, harvest index, water productivity, and nitrogen use efficiency across different treatments. Mean values between treatments were compared using the LSD test at a significance level of 0.05. The correlation coefficient matrix between different traits was plotted using the R package (corrplot). A correlation coefficient with an absolute value greater than 0.8 between two indicators was considered to have a strong correlation. Geographic images were plotted using ArcGIS 10.2. Histograms and scatter plots were generated using Origin 2023.

The changes of soil temperature in the 0 -10 cm layer during growth period for each treatment are shown in Fig.3. Soil temperatures gradually increased after the seedling stage and slowly decreased from the silking stage to maturity (Fig.3a-b). The range of soil temperature variations during the growing seasons in 2020 and 2021 was 14.2-27.1°C and 13.2-27.3 °C, respectively (Fig.3). Due to the ridge and furrow rain harvesting planting system covered with film, the soil temperatures of RF were higher 1.3-2.8℃ than that of CP treatment throughout both growing seasons. The findings demonstrate that the ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting could increased the soil temperature more than the conventional flat planting in consecutive growing periods. During the two experimental periods, RFN and RFSN were increased the soil temperature by 2.36% and 11.02% ,10.4% and 16.83%, 9.09% and 16.83%, 11.11% and 16.04%, 7.84% and 23.52% than that of RF at jointing, tasseling, silking, filling and maturity stages, respectively. Likewise, CPN and CPSN raised soil temperature by 0.25-2.1°C as compared to CP, with significant difference among CP, CPN and CPSN. These trends highlight that nutrient management has a certain impact on soil temperature in 2021 and 2022 (Fig.3a and b). Consequently, the rankings for soil temperature under various treatments were order: RFSN> RFN > RF > CPSN> CPN> CP, which indicated the planting pattern had large influence on soil temperature.



Dynamic changes in soil temperature (0-10 cm) under each treatments during the mazie growing period in 2020 (a) and 2021(b)

The dynamics of soil water storage (SWS) varied significantly throughout the six growing periods (Fig.4). In 2020, the SWS exhibited an increase during the initial growth stage, reaching its peak at the tasseling stage. Subsequently, it decreased as the water consumption of maize increased, reaching its lowest level during the filling stage. However, the water consumption of corn plants gradually decreased and the SWS increased during the maturity period. Moving on to 2021, the SWS showed a gradual rise during the seedling stage and reached its highest level during the jointing stage. Overall, the soil water storage levels (0-60 cm) were higher in 2021 (characterized by wet year) than in 2020 (normal rainfall year). Planting patterns and nutrient management type affected the SWS at 0-60 cm soil layer over the growing seasons, but the effects varied at different growth stages (Fig.4). The five treatments of RF, CPN, RFN, CPSN and RFSN consistently and significantly enhanced SWS higher than that of CP at tasseling stage by 10.4% (9.2%) , 3% (4%), 10.1% (10.8%), 6.3% (8.2%), and 17.1% (12.6%) in the 0-60 cm layer in 2020 (2021). The ridge and furrow rain harvesting planting system, especially RF, RFN and RFSN significantly improved the SWS by 14.8% (6.1%), 14% (6%), and 18.6% (8.3%) at silking stage, and improved by 8.5% (10.4%), 9.4% (10.2%), and 10.6% (12.4%) at filling stage, and by compared to CP for 2020 (2021). At maturity stage of two years, CP consistently maintained a lower level of SWS, while the highest SWS value of RFSN were increased by the average of 7.8%, 1.6%, 6.1%, 1.4% and 3.3% than in CP, RF, CPN, RFN and RFSN, respectively.



The changes of soil water storage in the 0-60 cm soil depth in planting pattern and integrated nutrient management treatments during the summer maize growing seasons of 2020 and 2021

The maize yield was significantly affected by planting patterns and integrated nutrient management (Fig.5a). In the 2020 and 2021, the grain yield of RF significantly increased by 4.7% and 5.7% (mean 5.2%) comparing with CP; FPN were increased by 2.9 % and 3.1% (mean 3%) compared with CPN; RFSN were 7.1% and 3.9% (mean 5.5%) higher than that of CPSN. These findings demonstrate that the ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting treatments significantly increased grain yield compared with the conventional flat planting treatments. In both years, the RFSN were increased the grain yield by 7.4% and 8.1% than that of RFN, with a mean increase of 7.8%; the grain yield of RFN was significantly higher than that of RF by 5.4% and 8.4%, with a mean increase of 6.9% (P< 0.05). This suggests that the order of importance for increasing grain yield through nutrient management was integrated nitrogen fertilizer and crop straw > nitrogen fertilizer, as illustrated in Fig.5a. Regardless of 2020 and 2021, grain yield was highest in FRSN and lowest in CP (Fig.5a).

The box boundaries indicate the upper and lower quartiles, the whisker caps indicate 75th and 25th percentiles. *, ** and *** significant atP<0.05, 0.01and 0.001 level, respectively.Various treatments in the same year are indicated by lowercase letters above the columns, and the same treatments across different years are indicated by capital letters above the columns

Similar trends were observed in above-ground biomass across the treatments over two seasons, with no significant inter-annual variability (Fig.5b). In 2020 and 2021, the above-ground biomass of the ridge and furrow (RF) planting system was 7.3% and 2.1% (mean 4.7%) higher than that of the conventional flat planting (CP) system (Fig.5b). Additionally, the average above-ground biomass of the ridge and furrow with nitrogen (RFN) treatments showed a 0.22% and 4.47% higher biomass compared to CPN, with a mean increase of 2.3%. Over the two-year period, the ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting system consistently exhibited higher above-ground biomass compared to the conventional flat planting treatments. Without considering the planting pattern, the above-ground biomass of RFSN was 6.2% and 3.1% higher than RFN, with a mean difference of 4.6%; RFN increased the above-ground biomass by 1.7% and 7.9% (mean 4.8%) compared to RF. Therefore, the 2 years of above-ground biomass were still highly influenced by ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting and its interaction with nitrogen fertilizer and crop straw, represented by the high significant effect. The above-ground biomass in all treatments ranked of RFSN>CPSN>RFN> CPN>RF>CP.

Harvest index (HI) under different planting pattern and integrated nutrient management treatments were shown in Fig.5c and d. The results showed that the HI ranged from 0.43 to 0.51, with an average of 0.46 and 0.48 in 2020 and 2021, and most of HI within 0.45-0.5 (Fig.5c). In the same growth period, the highest harvest index in RFSN treatment was 51.1% and 56.9% higher than that of CP in 2021 and 2022. The lowest harvest index is CP in 2020 and 2021. However, no significant differences were found among RF, RFN, CPN, and CPSN in both years.

Nitrogen content of the grain and straw was strongly influenced by ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting system and nutrient management in these two years (P<0.05, Table1). Across all years, RFSN had the greatest grain N content and straw N content, which were 18.1% and 7.13% higher than CPSN in 2020 and by17.7% and 4.1 % in 2021, respectively. The average N content of the grain and straw of FPN was 40.1% (10.1%) and 23% (11.2%) lower than that of FPSN in 2020 (2021), respectively. CP had the lowest average N content of the grain, while which had the lowest at N content in straw. The N contents of the both grain and straw were highest in RFSN, followed by CPSN, FPN and CPN, but CP had the lowest N content of the grain and straw in both years (Table1).

Grain N content and Straw N content under different planting pattern and integrated nutrient management treatments in maize growing periods

According to Fig.6, RFSN treatments significantly increased the plant N uptake of maize from 2020 to 2021. In all treatments, the plant N uptake in different organs was ranked as grain > straw. In 2020 and 2021, the plant N uptake in RFN was 148.8 kg ha-1and 163 kg ha-1), which was 25.7% and 25.9% higher than that of RF (Fig.6). Furthermore, the CPN showed an improvement in plant N uptake by 34.4% in 2020 and by 30% in 2021 compared to the CP. It is worth noting that both FPN and CPN treatments resulted in an initial increase in plant N uptake in 2020 and 2021 due to the application of N fertilizer. Additionally, RFSN improved plant N uptake than that in RFN by 34.9% in 2020, and 23.5% in 2021, respectively; CPSN increased the plant N uptake by 25.3% and 19.2% than that of CPN. These results indicated that the improvement in plant N uptake was mainly associated with the regulation of straw and fertilizer, which was promoted by the increase in soil moisture and temperature caused by ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting system practices.

Under the same nutrient management, ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting system treatments significantly increased WP compared with the conventional flat planting treatments (Fig.7a). In 2020 and 2021, FP were increased by 4.01% and 2.03 % (mean 3.02%) compared with CP. RFN were 5.5% and 2.9% (mean 4.2%) higher than that of CPN. Moreover, the RFSN showed an improvement in WP by 6.6% in 2020 and by 1.26% in 2021 compared to the CPSN. However, there were difference of the WP in various nutrient management treatments under same planting pattern (Fig.7a). In both years, the RFSN were increased the WP by 8.3% and 6.3% (mean 7.3%) than that of RFN; the WP of RFN was significantly higher than that of RF by 10.7% and 8.5% (mean 9.6%), respectively (P< 0.05), indicating the nutrient management significantly effect WP were showed crop straw combine with nitrogen fertilizer>nitrogen fertilizer. Regardless of 2020 and 2021, the WP effects followed the order of RFSN>CPSN>RFN>CPN>FR>CP.

Planting pattern and integrated nutrient management significantly influenced maize NUPE in both years (Fig.7b). The RFN improved NUPE by 8.3% and 10.2% (mean 9.3%) over CPN, while RFSN enhanced NUPE by 16.5% and 14.3% (mean 15.4%) over CPSN in 2020 and 2021. NUPE was higher in the ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting system compared to conventional flat planting treatments. In both years, the RFSN were increased the NUPE by 34.9% and 23.5% (mean 29.2%) than that of RFN, respectively (P< 0.05). The NUPE of CPSN were significantly higher by 25.3% and 19.2% than CPN, with a mean increase of 22.3%. These results indicating NUPE showed a gradual increase with the integrated of nitrogen fertilizer and straw management under ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting system. Over the two years, RFSN had the highest NUPE, resulting in the following order: RFSN > CPSN > RFN > CPN.

Agronomic Efficiency of N (AEN) is a metric used to quantify the impact of nitrogen application on yield increase. Significant differences (p<0.05) were observed in AEN among various treatments, The RFN significantly increased AEN than that of CPN, with a mean increase by 67.8% , whereas the AEN of RFSN was 53.9% and 85.2% higher than that of CPSN in 2020 and 2021, with a increase of 69.6%. These results indicated that the ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting system and nutrient management playing a strong influencing role. Over two growing seasons, the RFSN treatment exhibited the highest AEN values, showing increases of 58 % and 31% compared to RFN (Fig.7c), with a increase of 44.5%. Similarly, CPSN treatment showed AEN increases of 34.7% and 43.9% (mean 39.3%) compared to CPN in 2020 and 2021, respectively. These findings suggest that integrated of nitrogen fertilizer and straw management significantly enhances AEN under ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting system.

In two years, planting patterns and integrated nutrient management had significant effects on PFPN (Fig.7d). Comparing with CPN, the PFPN of RFN significantly increased by 3.2% and 2.9% (mean 3.1%) in 2020 and 2021, respectively (Fig.7d). The PFPN of RFSN was 7.1% and 3.9% (mean 5.5%) higher than that of CPSN in both years. These findings demonstrate that the ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting treatments significantly increased grain yield compared with the conventional flat planting treatments. In both years, the RFSN were increased the PFPN by 7.4% and 8.1% than that of RFN, with a mean increase of 7.8%; the PFPN of CPSN was significantly higher than that of CPN by 3.5% and 7.1%, with a mean increase of 5.3% (P< 0.05). This suggests that the order of importance for increasing PFPN through nutrient management was integrated nitrogen fertilizer and crop straw > nitrogen fertilizer. The FPFN were highest in RFSN, followed by CPSN, FPN, but CPN had the lowest FPFN in both years (Fig.7d).

To clarify the effect of planting pattern and integrated nutrient management on the distribution of SOC fractions, the contents of the four soil organic carbon and nitrogen fractions (DOC, EOC, MBC and MBN) were determined in the 0-20 cm soil layer with similar trends: RFSN>CPSN>RFN>CPN>RF>CP (Fig.8a-d). The DOC concentrations of the RF, CPN, RFN, CPSN, and RFSN treatments were significantly higher than that in CP by 16.3%, 22.3 %, 34.1%, 52.5 % and 53.2% in 2020, and by 5.6%, 27.6%, 28.7%, 44.6%, and 51.1% in 2021, respectively (Fig.8a). The EOC concentration was significantly higher by 4.0%-25.4 % (2020) and 7.3%-26.1% (2021) in RFSN compared to the other treatments, and there was a slight increase in EOC concentration corresponding to the input of straw and nitrogen fertilizer to the soil. A significant difference was found between the CPSN, RFN, CPN and RF treatments in both years (Fig.8b).



Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), easily oxidizable organic carbon (EOC), soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and soil microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) under the various planting pattern and integrated nutrient management treatments in 2020 and 2021. Various treatments in the same year are indicated by lowercase letters above the columns, and the same treatments across different years are indicated by capital letters above the columns

Particularly in RFSN, increased the concentrations of MBC in the 0-20 cm layer by 12.5% (8.8% ) and 96.3% (80.8%) compared to CPSN and CP in 2020 (2021) (Fig.8c). The lowest MBC concentration value was found in the CP treatment, the MBC values increased by 74.3% (66.1%) , 58.8% (52.6%), 40.2% (37.3%), and 15.1% (8.5%) in the CPSN RFN, CPN, and RF treatments in 2020 (2021), respectively (Fig.8c). The MBN were stimulated by 86.7%, 73.5%, 42.1%, 21.8%, and 8.0% under RFSN, CPSN, RFN, CPN, and RF relative to CP in 2020, and by 56.2%, 54.9%, 43.2%, 38.4%, and 20.3% in 2021, respectively (Fig.8d).

In order to determine the key factors that affected soil hydrothermal environment and yield components, the correlations between soil temperature in 0-10cm soil layer at maturity stages, SWS, grain yield, above-ground biomass, HI, grain and straw N content, plant N uptake, WP, NUPE, AEN, PFPN, DOC, EOC, MBC and MBN during different growth periods (Fig.9). Strong positive correlations coefficients (r≥0.71) existed between the grain and straw N content, plant N uptake, DOC, EOC, MBC and MBN were significantly positively correlated with grain yield, while there were significant correlations with the above-ground biomass had significant correlations with grain N content, plant N uptake, DOC, EOC and MBC (r=0.748, 0.846, 0.778, 0.843 and 0.78) (Fig.9). Grain N content was significantly related to plant N uptake, NUPE and AEN, and the correlation coefficients ranged from 0.824 to 0.935 (Fig.9). In particular, straw N content (r=0.801, 0.717 and 0.846 ) and plant N uptake (r=0.871, 0.919, and 0.903) was positive correlated with DOC, EOC and MBC (Fig.9).

The PCA biplot (Fig.10) represents the correlation between soil hydrothermal environment and yield components under planting pattern and integrated nutrient management, and the cosine value between each pair of black arrows represents the correlation between the two variables. The first principal component (PC1) could explain 73.2% variability, while the PC2 was associated with 10.2% variability. Grain yield, straw N content, plant N uptake, grain N content, above-ground biomass, soil temperature, SWS, DOC, EOC, MBC and MBN had positively correlated. Different treatments showed good differentiation on PC1 (Fig.10).

The pursuit of increasing maize yield is a global goal in agriculture, with cropping patterns and nutrient management playing crucial roles in sustainable agricultural development. Planting and fertilization strategies for maize differ based on specific indicators. Hence, it is essential to develop a comprehensive evaluation model that considers each indicator individually to objectively and accurately assess maize indicators. The ultimate aim of this evaluation is to determine the optimal combination of planting patterns and nutrient management treatments. The study focused on analyzing grain yield, above-ground biomass, harvest index (HI), grain and straw nitrogen (N) content, plant N uptake, water productivity (WP) using gray relation analysis and entropy weighted TOPSIS model to assess the overall performance of maize (Table2). The average correlation coefficients between the rated value of gray relation analysis model and another model ranged from 0.934 ~ 0.970 in 2021 to 0.817 ~ 0.939 in 2022 (Table2). The results indicate that there are slight differences in the results and rankings of the same treatment under different integrated evaluation methods.The greater the evaluation value, the better the evaluation object. Obviously, CP is not the best combination. This study proposed six planting models and nutrient treatments, the better combinations obtained from this evaluation were consistent: FPSN was rank first, follow by CPSN in 2020 and 2021 (Table2). Specifically, the best treatment was ridge and furrow rain harvesting planting system and integrated straw and nitrogen management, which could achieve high yield while maintaining a high level of water-N use efficiency.

Results of correlation degree and ranking based on gray relation analysis and entropy weighted TOPSIS evaluation model

This study investigated the impact of planting pattern and integrated nutrient management on soil hydrothermal environment, yield and use efficiency. Previous research has primarily focused on the interaction between indicators under different film mulching with the uniform planting patterns [17] or different planting patterns and N fertilizer rates [18], or different ridge-furrow ratios with the same planting pattern [5] , or variable planting patterns with the same organic amendments [19]. Our study uniquely explored the specific effects of N fertilizer or crop straw in grouping different integrated nutrient management measures with varying planting pattern on maize production soil hydrothermal environment, yield and use efficiency.In present study, soil temperatures showed gradually increased after the seedling stage and slowly decreased from the silking stage to maturity (Fig.3a-b). Vaccari et al. [20] reported that soil temperature undergoes daily and seasonal changes, which are shaped by variables such as ambient air temperature, solar radiation, and the transfer of energy between the soil and the atmosphere. Our findings also revealed that the significant impact of the chosen planting pattern has a substantial impact on soil temperature, with the rankings for soil temperature in the 0-10 cm layer during the growth period under different treatments as RFSN>RFN>RF>CPSN>CPN>CP (Fig.3). Unlike other yield and efficiency indicators, integrated nutrient management had a certain effect on soil temperature, and the planting pattern had largely increased the soil temperature, particularly in the ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting treatment. The implementation of mulching in the ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting system can effectively reduce the long-wave solar radiation emitted from the soil to the atmosphere, and thus slowed down the loss of soil heat and increased the thermal environment of the farmland soil [21]. Previous study have reported that the soil temperature of 0-100cm layer with the ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting system treatment was consistently 1.0~3.07 ℃ higher compared to conventional flat planting during the jointing, flowering, filling, and harvesting stages [22]. This temperature difference significantly enhanced maize growth and development at various stages. We also obtained the results in present study that the ridge and furrow rain harvesting planting system covered with film, the soil temperatures of RF were higher 1.3-2.8℃ than those of CP treatments throughout both growing seasons (Fig.3). further confirmed that the mulching can effectively increase soil temperature, while ridge and ridge mulching has a greater effect on increasing soil temperature. This phenomenon has been validated in prior research, demonstrating that plant canopies are sufficiently small for solar radiation to penetrate and heat the surface soil beneath the plastic film. A previous study also reported a similar increase in soil temperature with the use of continuous furrow and plastic film covering in winter rapeseed fields in northwest China [23]. Li et al.[24] found that the ridge-furrow with film mulching increased soil temperature ranged from 6.7% to 20.8% at 50-150 mm soil layers compared to the control, respectively. The ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting treatment not only increased planting surface area and ground roughness, and improved the capacity to absorb solar radiation, but also provided a warming effect through ground film. The highest values of soil temperature were observed for RFSN at the whole maize growing stages (Fig.3). Recently, the impact of crop straw addition on soil temperature can be explained by the combined effect of factors such as soil surface reflectivity, thermal conductivity and albedo changes. Therefore, the ridges treated with N fertilizer and straw have been shown to moderate soil temperature fluctuations and warm the soil by decreasing soil surface albedo and thermal conductivity at ridge tops. However, it is important to note that this treatment does have an impact on soil temperature at furrow bottom.

Soil moisture is primarily influenced by rainfall infiltration, with crops absorbing and utilizing only about25% of the water, while the remaining 65% is lost to evaporation and runoff [25]. Substantial fluctuations in SWS due to varying inter-annual precipitation. In our current study, we identified the SWS levels (0-60 cm) were higher in 2021 (characterized by wet year) than in 2020 (low annual precipitation) (Fig.4). Previous studies have shown that soil moisture is closely relevant to the temporal distribution and amount of rainfall, planting pattern, and nutrient application [26–28]. During the seeding stages, the SWS in the FP, FPN and exhibited a significant increase compared to the conventional flat planting treatment (Fig.4). This can be attributed to the bits of soil evaporation in the initial growth stage of plants. Specially, when the crop canopy is small and not yet dense, the use of ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting plays a crucial role in reducing soil evaporation [29]. In addition, when corn is growing vigorously, water gradually evaporates from the soil in the middle and late stages and is converted into transpiration within the plant . Present studies have demonstrated that the ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting can effectively improve the maize growth rate, which can lead to an increase in the transpiration rate of the plant, which may help counterbalance the rise in soil moisture resulting from flat land and ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting, which caused the SWS decreased in lately growth stage [30].

In the current study, we identified the FPSN and CPSN increased soil water storage (P< 0.05) at all stages, compared to FPN and CPN (Fig.4). The results further indicated that straw management positively soil water storage regardless of the planting pattern. This effect can be attributed to the ability of straw to retain water for a longer period, resulting in slower surface water flow and increased water infiltration into the soil. The addition of straw also improves water infiltration by modifying soil physical properties through the presence of organic matter and providing additional pathways for water absorption [31,32]. Previous studies have demonstrated that straw returning and different planting patterns play a significant role in maintaining soil water storage through various mechanisms [33].

Planting pattern and nutrient management are critical factors influencing maize growth. In present study, we found that the ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting system treatments significantly increased grain yield and above-ground biomass compared with the conventional flat planting treatments. The adoption of furrow and ridge rainfall harvesting pattern planting pattern can be attributed to enhanced water availability and temperature condition, leading to a substantial increase in grain yield and biomass (Fig.5a), consistent with findings from previous studies on maize, potato [34], soybean [35], millet [36]. The furrow and ridge rainwater harvesting planting system is effective in reducing soil evaporation by using a physical barrier of plastic film [37]. Additionally, the topography of the ridges helps direct rainwater into the furrows, and allowing the collected precipitation to seep into deeper soils, which increased water productivity and grain yields, particularly in drought conditions. Previous studies have confirmed that mulching in the furrow and ridge rainwater harvesting planting system suppressed weed competition for resources and enhanced crop growth, which led to a significant increase in grain yield and above-ground biomass [38]. Similarly, Fan et al. [28] found that the 8-year average maize yield increased by 22.7% in the ridge and furrow rain harvesting planting system most significantly compared with the conventional flat planting treatments. Fang et al. [39] found that the wheat yield under the ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting system increased by 13.0-32.9%, 15.5%-35.2% and 27.2-58.9% in 2013-2014, 2014-2015 and 2015-2016. Mo et al. [14] showed the grain yield and above-ground biomass in RFRH increased by 6.8%-73.1% and 70.9%-87.2% compared with the conventional flat planting treatments. Interestingly, we found that the grain yield and above-ground biomass of RFN was significantly increased by a mean of 6.9% and 4.8% than that of RF, respectively (Fig.7a and b). The present results also shown that this result suggests that nitrogen fertilizer resulted in increase of grain yield, and a possible synergistic effect of N and water on yield performance, which has been previously reported [40]. Besides, our study found the RFSN were highest in the grain yield and above-ground biomass, with a increase of 7.8% and 4.6 % than that of RFN (Fig.7a and b). These results shown that grain yield and above- ground biomass were still highly influenced by nitrogen fertilizer and its interaction with crop straw treatments. Previous studies by Alburquerque et al. [41] also highlighted the positive effect of straw addition on crop production, attributing it to the retention of nutrients, particularly beneficial in rough and barren soils. Ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting system and nitrogen fertilizer management is effective in optimizes the water, nutrient and soil environmental factors necessary for crop growth. Specifically, mulching combined with integrated of nitrogen fertilizer and crop straw resulted in a significant increase in production.

Crop production in arid and semi-arid regions has faced challenges of limited water availability. It is critical to develop cropping patterns that conserve water, maintain economic yield and increase maize production. The primary goal is to improve water productivity (WP) by reducing crop evapotranspiration (ET) while increasing grain yields [42]. The findings in this study suggest that the ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting system treatments significantly increased WP compared with the conventional flat planting treatments (Fig.7a). This is mainly due to the fact that ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting system enhances the hydrothermal environment by using mulching, and reduced ineffective soil evaporation with larger canopies and enhances water productivity through effective rainwater harvesting [7]. These alterations promote root system growth and extension, and improving the crop's capacity to absorb water and nutrients. Additionally, this planting pattern reduces soil moisture evaporation through crop transpiration, and ultimately enhancing the WP. Previous studies have shown similar results in line with previous studies conducted in semi-arid Kenya. Gu et al. [23] found that the ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting system treatments was increased the WP by 41.8 and 93.1% than conventional flat planting treatments, respectively. However, In this study, the WP of FPN was significantly higher than that of RF, while the WP of RFSN was the highest (Fig.7a). These results indicated that ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting system and nutrient management could significantly improve water utilization. Previous studies have also shown that the addition of biochar under ridge and furrow rain-harvesting systems increased the WP and NUE by 14.5% and 12.0% [37]. This may be due to the fact that the addition of crop straw increased the saturated water content of the soil, higher soil moisture and nitrogen effectiveness provided an important guarantee of high yields, plus the availability of nutrients in the root zone, and the good water supply under the rain-flooding mode. This may be due to the fact that the addition of organic matter increased the saturated water content of the soil [43], which helps in crop growth, yield formation and water and fertilizer utilization efficiency. More importantly, efficient utilization of precipitation resources in semi-arid zones is a key factor influencing yield stability in maize [7]. Within a certain range, nutrient management can promote crop growth and facilitate water absorption and utilization by the root system, and ultimately increased WP promoted the uptake of nutrients by the crop.

Effective water-saving planting patterns can play a crucial role in determining the availability of nutrients in the soil by influencing the conversion of existing nutrients through moisture and facilitating the conversion of unavailable nutrients into forms that can be easily absorbed by plants [44]. In addition, water also affects the conversion rate of nutrients in the soil, and therefore implementing the ridge and furrow rain harvesting system is an important measure to increase soil moisture, which can significantly enhance nitrogen uptake and utilization by crop [45]. Our study results indicated that the ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting system increased the plant N uptake (Fig.7a and b) and effectively promotes nitrogen utilization (Fig.7b, c and d). Previous research findings have demonstrated that the ridge-furrow mulching cultivation could efficiently enhance nitrogen accumulation in maize, leading to a 49.6% increase in PFP and a 25.7% increase in AEN. Our findings further revealed that the RFN improved the NUPE, AEN and FPFN compared with CPN, with a mean increase of 9.3%, 67.8% and 3.1% (Fig.7b, c and d), whereas the NUPE, AEN and FPFN of RFSN treatment significantly increased compared to CPSN, with a mean increase of 16.5%, 69.6% and 5.5% in both growing years (Fig.7b, c and d). Overall, these results highlight the NUPE, AEN and PFPN was higher in the ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting system compared to conventional flat planting treatments. These results indicated that ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting system effectively improves soil water temperature, regulates crop root distribution, and creates a favorable rhizo-sphere microenvironment. These factors provide optimal conditions for crop nutrient absorption, facilitating nitrogen accumulation and utilization, and are closely related to NUPE, AEN, and PFPN, which are influenced by soil nutrient availability and soil water status. Our study also found that the RFSN were significantly improvement in the NUPE, AEN, and FPFN than that of RFN, with a mean increase of 29.2%, 44.5% and 7.8%. whereas CPSN increased NUPE, AEN and PFPN than that of CPN, with a mean improvement by 22.3%, 39.3% and 5.3% (Fig.7b-d). These results indicated effective nutrient management can also enhance NUPE, AEN, and PFPN..

Many Researches investigated the impact of furrow and ridge rainwater harvesting patterns with biochar or fertilizer on maize yield, water and fertilizer use efficiency, soil temperature, and crop quality. Due to the diverse water and nutrient requirements across different parameters, relying solely on qualitative analyses is inadequate for research goals. Therefore, this study adopts gray relation analysis and entropy weighted TOPSIS model to make the evaluation more objective and reliable. Gray relation analysis is a method of quantitative comparison using mathematical means and comparability and similarity of series. The traditional TOPSIS model generally adopts hierarchical analysis or expert opinion survey method when determining the weighting factors of evaluation indicators. However, entropy weighted TOPSIS model carries out dimensionless treatment on all the index traits by vector normalization method, which can compare the research objects under the same criteria for evaluation, avoid the influence of subjective factors to a certain extent, and evaluate the traits under different treatments more accurately. At present, gray relation analysis and entropy weighted TOPSIS model methods have been widely used. Zhang et al. [12] adopted the membership function, principal component analysis, gray relation analysis and entropy weighted TOPSIS model were used to evaluate the best irrigation amount and fertilization rate, and finally determined that 270-290 mm (irrigation) and 167-193 kg N ha-1deserves further development and validation for improving potato yield. Wang et al. [48] was studied the irrigation and N fertilization on fruit yield, quality, net income and water-N productivity on cherry tomato and found that the optimization of irrigation of 80% ET0 and 360 kg N ha-1N fertilizer supply schedule based on the entropy-weight TOPSIS method was conducive to maintaining yield and income better. In this study, both models can determine the weight of indicators without being affected by personal factors. The results of this study showed that RFSN treatment (application of maize straw 1.5 t ha-1and chemical nitrogen fertilizer of 180 kg ha-1in ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting system) was the best combination management for maize cultivation.

Ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting system and integrated nutrient management had significantly effects on soil temperature, gravimetric soil water content, soil water storage, grain yield, above-ground biomass, N content, plant N uptake, WP, NUPE, AEN and PFPN. The changes of soil temperature in the 0-10 cm layers showed similar seasonal trends, with gradually increased after the seedling stage and slowly decreased from the silking stage to maturity. Similary, the SWS increased during the early growth stages and peaked at its highest level in the tasseling stage. The ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting system treatments significantly increased grain yield and above-ground biomass compared with the conventional flat planting treatments, and the order of importance for increasing grain yield and above-ground through nutrient management was integrated nitrogen fertilizer and crop straw > nitrogen fertilizer. Regardless of 2020 and 2021, the grain and straw N content, plant N uptake, WP, NUPE, AEN, and PFPN also similar with the trend of grain yield and above-ground, which were highest in RFSN, followed by CPSN, FPN and CPN, FP and lowest in CP. However, the effect of fertilizer was more obvious under RFSN compared with CP, thereby indicating a positive interaction between water and integrated nutrient management. Nevertheless, the contents of the four soil organic carbon and nitrogen fractions (DOC, EOC, MBC and MBN) were determined in the 0-20 cm soil layer with similar trends: RFSN>CPSN>RFN>CPN>RF>CP. Eventually, the results of gray relation analysis and entropy weighted TOPSIS model demonstrated that ridge and furrow rain-harvesting planting system as a suitable pattern for optimizing water use with application of maize straw 1.5 t ha-1and application of chemical nitrogen fertilizer of 180 kg ha-1(RFSN) was as a promise strategy in enhancing yield and utilization efficiency on the Loess Plateau in China based on the comprehensive consideration of soil temperature, soil water storage, yield productivity, uptake, water-N productivity and soil carbon fraction, which is attractive because it is simple to implement, enhances soil fertility, and improves overall nutrient utilization.

Studies of cold‐active enzymes may elucidate the basis for low‐temperature activity and contribute to their wider application in energy‐efficient processes. Here we investigate the cold‐active GH2β‐galactosidase from the psychrophilic bacteriumAlkalilactibacillus ikkensis(AiLac). AiLac has a specific activity twice as high as its closest structural homolog (the mesophilicEscherichia coliGH2β‐galactosidase) toward the lactose analog ONPG at room temperature and neutral pH, and shows biphasic behavior in Michaelis–Menten plots. AiLac is activated by Mg2+and Na+and is most effective at pH 7.0 and 30°C. However, early unfolding events are observed already at room temperature. Stability studies using intrinsic fluorescence, circular dichroism, and small‐angle x‐ray scattering (SAXS), combined with activity assays, showed AiLac to be highly sensitive to heat and urea and to be stabilized, but also inhibited, by loss of structural flexibility induced by the osmolyte trehalose.

Enzymes from psychrophilic organisms, for example, bacteria growing in polar regions or the depths of the oceans, often exhibit high catalytic efficiency at low temperatures as their hosts adapt to the cold at the molecular level (Feller & Gerday,2003). Cold‐active enzymes present great potential for biocatalysis within industrial food production and preservation, detergents, textiles, and pharmaceuticals (Singh et al.,2016), where high activity at low operating temperatures may conveniently be combined with inactivation at moderately elevated temperatures. Understanding molecular and structural adaptations of psychrophilic enzymes opens a window for both discovery and bioengineering of novel enzymes with useful properties (Nowak & Otzen,2024).

Efficient catalysis at low temperatures is attributed to a change in the way in which the rate constant (kcat) depends on temperature according to the general relationshipkcat∝kBT/h×e−∆Hǂ/RT×e−∆Sǂ/R, where ΔH‡and ΔS‡are the activation enthalpy and entropy of catalysis, respectively,kBis Boltzmann's constant,Tis the absolute temperature,Ris the gas constant, andhis the Planck constant (Eyring,1935). Numerous psychrophilic enzymes show lowered ΔH‡and increased ΔS‡compared to their mesophilic counterparts (Åqvist,2017). This phenomenon is a key adaptation that decreases the otherwise exponential reduction inkcatat lower temperatures. Structurally, this is seen as comparatively higher flexibility. While this makes the psychrophilic enzymes relatively less temperature dependent, it also makes them less stable than their meso‐ and thermophilic homologs (Fields,2001). Indeed, several psychrophilic enzymes have been reported to lose activity at temperatures significantly lower than their global unfolding transition, emphasizing their lability toward heat and their high general dynamics (Cipolla et al.,2011; Collins et al.,2003; Feller et al.,1992).

Enhanced flexibility has been observed both locally and globally in protein structure (Feller & Gerday,2003). Enzymes can achieve increased flexibility through various adaptations which vary from protein to protein, for example, fewer disulfide bridges, more Gly residues, fewer salt bridges on the protein surface, fewer aromatic residues in the protein core but more on the surface, and lower Pro and Arg content (D'Amico et al.,2003; Siddiqui & Cavicchioli,2006). Furthermore, changes in subunit interface interactions or complete rearrangements of the subunits in a protein may influence stability and flexibility through intermolecular interactions and exposure to solvent (Russell et al.,1998). Indeed, there is a tendency for psychrophiles to reduce the level of subunit association compared to their meso‐ and thermophilic homologues. Thus, GH2β‐Galactosidase forms an octamer in the thermophilicThermotoga maritima(Míguez Amil et al.,2020), a tetramer in most mesophiles, and a dimer in the psychrophileArthrobactersp. 32cB (Rutkiewicz et al.,2019). Similar observations have been made for the ultrathermophilic triosephosphate isomerase fromPyrococcus woesei(a tetramer) (Walden et al.,2001) and psychrophilic Trigger Factor chaperone protein fromPsychrobacter frigidicolahas(a monomer) (Robin et al.,2009). In both cases, their mesophilic counterparts are dimers and their unique oligomerization arrangements have been ascribed to adaptation to heat or cold, respectively. However, multimerization has also been observed in psychrophilicβ‐glucosidase fromExiguobacterium antarcticum(a hexamer) andβ‐galactosidase fromArthrobactersp. C2‐2 (Skálová et al.,2005; Zanphorlin et al.,2016) (a tetramer), suggesting that a decrease in oligomerization is not a simple and universally applicable adaptation mechanism for activity at low temperatures. Furthermore, a thorough computational study of a cold‐adapted short chain dehydrogenase has shown that enzyme multimerization does not affect its temperature dependence of activation (Koenekoop et al.,2022). Therefore, it remains to be determined to what extent enzymes adapt to cold through changes in quaternary structure.

β‐galactosidases (lactases) are a group of enzymes capable of hydrolyzingβ‐D‐galactosides such as lactose. Cold‐activeβ‐galactosidases are of special interest for dairy industries by allowing potentially cost‐effective production of lactose‐free milk under refrigerated conditions. In 2010, a GH2β‐galactosidase (1041 aa, 119.13 kDa, here termed AiLac) from the bacteriumAlkalilactibacillus ikkensisgrowing in ikaite columns in the Ikka Fjord of south‐western Greenland was discovered and reported to have a low activity optimum of 20–30°C, retaining 60% of its maximal activity at 5°C (Schmidt & Stougaard,2010). This enzyme was predicted to be structurally homologous to GH2β‐galactosidase fromEscherichia coli(EcLac, a tetramer), which provides a well‐characterized mesophilic reference point.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the structure and stability of AiLac to understand the molecular basis for its adaptations to high efficiency at low temperatures compared to EcLac. Specifically, we investigated how structure and activity are affected by temperature and urea. Temperature effects are crucial for understanding the stability of psychrophilic enzymes, while urea is a classic chemical denaturant extensively used to determine protein stability (Pace,1986). Since structural flexibility is a key parameter for cold activity, we also introduced the sugar osmolyte trehalose, which inhibits the catalytic activity of enzymes through a decrease in structural flexibility (Fedorov et al.,2011; Jain & Roy,2009; Sampedro & Uribe,2004). We followed activity using the colorimetric substrate analog ONPG and measured both stability and structure through biophysical techniques including circular dichroism (CD), intrinsic fluorescence, SAXS, flow‐induced dispersion analysis (FIDA), and size‐exclusion chromatography with multi‐angle light scattering (SEC‐MALS). We observed that AiLac activity is sensitive to Mg2+and NaCl and is only stable and active around neutral pH. AiLac is easily perturbed with chemical denaturants compared to other psychrophilic enzymes (Siddiqui Khawar et al.,2005) and forms a dimer that dissociates reversibly and without loss of activity, unlike the tetrameric structure of EcLac, which loses activity upon subunit dissociation (Juers et al.,2012). Finally, we explored the relationship between evolution and oligomerization. We hypothesized that most GH2β‐galactosidases originate from mesophilic organisms and exhibit greater stability than AiLac, primarily due to their adoption of higher‐order oligomeric conformations such as tetramers. Therefore, mutations conferring high evolutionary fitness are likely to promote structural shifts in AiLac toward more stable dimers and tetramers. To investigate this, we trained a machine learning model to discern the pattern within the natural sequences of the GH2β‐galactosidase family, extracted from the Uniprot100 protein database (Suzek et al.,2007). By incorporating highly evolutionary fit mutations at the structural interface, as predicted by our model, our experimental results demonstrated a significant increase in both the propensity for dimer and tetramer formation and the overall stability of AiLac. This highlights the efficiency of the evolutionary model as an efficient protein engineering method to modulate quaternary organization, which is directly related to the enzyme's temperature profile.

To establish the basis for subsequent biophysical analyses, we first identified conditions of optimal activity for AiLac. This was done using photometric activity assays with ONPG and thermal unfolding experiments measured by far‐UV CD. GH2β‐galactosidases are known to depend on Mg2+for both activity and stability (Case et al.,1973; Juers et al.,2012). Therefore, we investigated metal ion effects on AiLac. Several divalent metal ions increased the activity of AiLac, including Co2+, Ca2+, and Mg2+; conversely, Cu2+and the divalent metal ion chelator EDTA inhibited it (Figure1a). Closer inspection using dose–response curves identified an optimum for Mg2+at 0.1 mM (Figure1b). At this optimum,kcatis ca. 20‐fold higher than in 2 mM EDTA, namely 85.5 ± 3.0 U/mg versus 4.6 ± 0.1 U/mg (the latter shown as a blue stippled line in Figure1b). Here, the unit of specific activity (U/mg) is defined as a μmol of product released per minute per milligram of enzyme. However, 0.1 mM Mg2+does not significantly stabilize the structure in terms of melting temperature compared to 2 mM EDTA, which is indicated by the stippled red line (Figure1b). Interestingly, titration of Mg2+above 6.4 mM caused a lowering oftm. To probe the link between aggregation and increasing Mg2+concentrations, we measured aggregation through dynamic light scattering (DLS) as a function of temperature in parallel with differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF). These plots unambiguously showed that AiLac aggregates at lower temperatures at higher [Mg2+] (FigureS1). Increased aggregation may drive irreversible unfolding, thus decreasingtm. Ionic strength (NaCl concentration) also affected activity with an optimum between 56 mM and 106 mM (Figure1c), followed by a linear decrease with the square root of ionic strength. The linear decline in this plot suggests a simple screening effect rather than specific ion binding at the active site. To keep consistency among experiments, we decided to utilize phosphate saline (PBS) + 0.1 mM MgCl2pH 7.0 (see section below for pH optimization) that has an ionic strength of 160 mM (shown with stippled black line in Figure1c). Within error, the activity of AiLac in this buffer is the same as that measured at the peak of activity at 106 mM ionic strength (data not shown).



Optimal conditions for AiLac activity. (a) Effect of divalent ions and EDTA at 2 mM concentration on initial reaction rate of 8 nM AiLac in PBS. The results are normalized to the control (AiLac purified on SEC in PBS without additives). (b) Effect of Mg2+on catalytic rate of 8 nM AiLac in PBS (lefty‐axis), where the stippled blue line showskcatin 2 mM EDTA. Stability of 1.7 μM AiLac measured with DSF is represented by melting temperature (tm) (righty‐axis) where the red dotted line showstmin 2 mM EDTA. (c) Effect of NaCl on activity of 8 nM AiLac in phosphate buffer pH 7.0 with 0.1 mM Mg2+. Dotted line shows the ionic strength of buffer A, which is used in all subsequent experiments. d: Initial velocity (left axis, blue) and molecular weight of AiLac measured by SAXS (right axis, red) in 50 mM bis‐tris propane with pH‐values 6.0–9.5. Activity assays were performed at 8 nM concentration and SAXS at 3.4 μM. Red dotted lines mark theoretical MW of monomer (1N), dimer (2N), and tetramer (4N). AiLac aggregated at pH 6.0 and 6.5 before the SAXS experiment, represented by the red region in the graph.

To identify the optimal pH for enzymatic activity, we carried out ONPG activity assays using the buffer Bis‐Tris Propane whose buffering capacity spans the pH range 6.0–9.5. AiLac shows the highest initial reaction rate at pH 6.5, followed by a steep decline at higher pH and no significant activity above pH 8.5–9.0 (Figure1d). However, the enzyme aggregates at pH 6.0 and 6.5, as observed by large visible aggregates in the bottom of the Eppendorf tube occurring after ~1 h at room temperature. This shows that AiLac is only stable at or above neutral pH at RT. To probe quaternary structure, we recorded SAXS curves for 0.40 mg/mL AiLac at pH 7.0–9.5 at intervals of 0.5 pH units (FigureS2a). These data allowed us to determine the molecular weight (MW) of the AiLac structure in a model‐independent manner by extrapolating intensity to zero scattering vector modulus (q= 0,I(0)) (see “Materials and Methods”). This showed that the mass of the structure increased from mainly a dimer at pH 7.0–8.0 to a larger complex at pH 8.5 and above (Figure1d). However, AiLac does not unfold above pH 8.5 despite complex formation; SAXS data reveal that the tertiary structure only shows minor changes, as seen from the intensity in the mid‐qrange (FigureS2a) which is known to be largely unaffected by aggregation and oligomerization (Larsen et al.,2020). We conclude that pH 7.0 provided a compromise between high enzymatic activity and stable structure and therefore settled on phosphate buffer saline with an ionic strength of 160 mM at pH 7.0 in combination with 0.1 mM MgCl2as our optimal buffer for subsequent studies.

We next investigated how temperature‐induced changes in AiLac's activity and structure relate to each other. Activity experiments were performed at various temperatures, where both enzyme and substrate were pre‐incubated separately at a given temperature for 10 min before mixing and subsequently measuring initial velocity over a 10‐min period. This showed that AiLac and EcLac have temperature optima (topt) of 30 and 50°C, respectively (Figure2a). While the two proteins have essentially identical specific activity at their respectivetop(124 ± 7 and 138 ± 8 U/mg for AiLac and EcLac, respectively), AiLac showed ~2‐fold higher specific activity than EcLac toward ONPG at the AiLactoptof 30°C (but was completely inactive at the EcLactoptof 50°C). To obtain specific activation parameters, the initial specific activitykwas used for an Eyring plot (ln (k/T) versus 1/T, cf., legend to Figure2), which provides the enthalpy and entropy of activation (Figure2ainset). The two enzymes have identical enthalpies of activation but different entropies (Table1). While EcLac activity rises exponentially up totopt, AiLac activity starts to level off above 20°C, suggesting unfolding events taking place already at 25°C (Figure2a). To investigate this effect further, we performed Michaelis–Menten kinetics experiments with AiLac between 10 and 40°C. In this experiment, cooled enzyme is introduced to pre‐incubated substrate solution, and the initial velocity is measured for 1 min immediately after mixing, in contrast to the earlier experiment (Figure1a) where the enzyme was pre‐ncubated for 10 min. This approach reduces the time available to the enzyme for thermal inactivation and therefore leads to observable activity at 40°C (Figure2b). Here we observed biphasic kinetics, which yielded two individual Michaelis constants (Km1andKm2) and their corresponding maximal velocities (V1maxandV2max) when fit by Equation (1) (Figure2b). In an Eyring plot, bothV1maxandV2maxshow a linear dependency between 10 and 25°C (298 K), followed by a kink around 300 K and a new linear dependency with a lower slope as the temperature increases (Figure2b, inset). The biphasic kinetics may represent the binding of multiple substrate molecules, further analysis of which is outside the focus of the present investigation.



Effect of temperature on AiLac activity and structure. (a) Initial reaction rate of 8 nM AiLac (blue) and EcLac (red) in buffer A with 5 mM ONPG at different temperatures. The enzymes were pre‐equilibrated at the different temperatures for 10 min before measuring hydrolytic activity. (b) Michaelis–Menten plots of 8 nM AiLac in buffer A at different temperatures fitted to a two‐step binding scheme (Equation (1)). The enzyme was stored in ice right until the measurements; thus, we observe high rates above 30°C. The inset graph contains an Eyring plot (lnkcatT=−∆H‡R·1T+lnκkBh+ΔS‡R) of maximal rates of both phases (Vmax1andVmax2) fitted to two linear regressions for 10–25°C and 30–40°C. (c) Thermal unfolding of 1.3 μM AiLac in buffer A measured by far‐UV CD at different temperatures with a 0.5°C/min gradient. Only data up to 50°C are shown, after which the protein aggregated, leading to strong light dispersion. (d) Data from panel (c) shown for selected wavelengths along the temperature gradient. The lines are the best fits to a two‐step transition using Global3 analysis software. (e) Thermal unfolding of 5 μM AiLac in buffer A measured by near‐UV CD at different temperatures with a 0.5°C/min gradient. As in (c), only data up to 50°C and selected wavelengths along the temperature gradient (shapes) are fitted with a single‐step transition using Global3 analysis software (black lines). (f) SAXS data from FigureS2bshowing low‐q(proportional to mass) and mid‐q(proportional to tertiary structure) values as a function of temperature. All experiments are performed in PBS pH 7.0 with 0.1 mM Mg2+.

To investigate the process of thermal denaturation of AiLac in more detail, far‐UV CD spectra (260–200 nm) were recorded at steadily increasing temperatures (Figure2c). Upon heating, the minimum of the CD spectrum shifts from ⁓ 222 nm toward ⁓ 215 nm, suggesting loss ofα‐helical structures and prevalence ofβ‐sheets at high temperatures, which may be an indication of aggregation (Kelly et al.,2005). When plotted against temperature, ellipticities around 222–230 nm show two transitions which can be fitted to a double‐sigmoidal unfolding curve (Equation (4) described in “Materials and Methods”), giving a minor transition at 23.3°C and a major transition at 34.0°C (Figure2d). When repeating this experiment in the near‐UV region (320–260 nm) we only see one transition with atmof 36.8°C (Figure2e). Both far‐ and near‐UV CD show atmvalue consistent with a loss of activity due to unfolding slightly above the activitytoptof 30°C (Figure2a). This indicates that enzyme activity is lost upon global unfolding. The additional transition withtmof 23.3°C seen by far‐UV CD leads to a more subtle change in activity, manifesting as a change in the enthalpy of activation.

In addition, thermal unfolding of AiLac was investigated by SAXS analysis, where an AiLac sample was heated from 10 to 45°C in steps of 5°C and a 30‐min measuring time (FigureS2b). Here, we observed a transition between 25 and 35°C where AiLac started to aggregate and form complexes with a larger mass (seen by an increase at low‐qvalues, Figure2f) and the tertiary structure was broken down (seen by a decrease in mid‐qvalues, Figure2f). This transition involved a shift in radius of gyration (Rg) from 4.3 nm at 25°C to 7.4 nm at 30°C and 12.0 nm at 35°C (TableS1). Gratifyingly, theRgof 4.3 nm is close to the size of a dimeric structure (4.39 nm); however, theRgof 12.6 nm is far from a fully unfolded monomer of ~60 nm (assumingRg~N0.588, whereN= 1042 aa) (Flory,1953). Both transitions for low‐ and mid‐qvalues have a midpoint around 32°C, in agreement with CD data above. However, DLS data recorded in parallel with DSF show that aggregation only starts above 40°C (FigureS1b), which is likely due to SAXS being run at 11.5 times higher protein concentration.

We now compare the stability and activity of AiLac with that of EcLac in the presence of increasing amounts of the chemical denaturant urea. EcLac follows a single sigmoidal transition with reasonably coinciding midpoints at 5.0 M urea for activity (ONPG hydrolysis) and 5.1 M urea for tertiary structure (Trp fluorescence) (Figure3a). There is a sloping baseline for activity below the major transition, which we attribute to a general inhibitory effect of urea prior to unfolding. In contrast, while AiLac activity is lost in a single transition with a midpoint at 0.66 M urea, Trp fluorescence and far‐UV CD measurements show a double transition with midpoints at ca. 0.6 M and ca. 4 M urea (Figure3a). Thus, the initial transition is responsible for the complete loss of activity but only partial loss of secondary and tertiary structure.

The first transition of AiLac at low urea concentration was further investigated by SAXS and FIDA. SAXS revealed that unfolding and aggregation had started at the lowest measured value of 0.25 M urea, which was seen as an increase in particle mass (increase in intensity at low‐qvalues) and loss of tertiary structure (decrease in intensity at mid‐qvalues) compared to 0 M urea (Figure3bandS2c). These changes plateau at 0.8 M urea, after which no significant transitions were observed. Furthermore, these two parameters changed in parallel, which indicated that AiLac was unfolded by urea, and these unfolded structures immediately formed larger aggregates. Similarly, FIDA performed at 0.1 μM AiLac showed an increase in the hydrodynamic radiusRhabove 0.4 M urea, which reaches a plateau at 1.0 M urea (Figure3c). Finally, the enzymes' ability to refold by dilution from the urea‐unfolded state of AiLac and EcLac was tested by intrinsic fluorescence and activity assays. Upon dilution of AiLac into 0.1 M urea from 1.1 M urea, only 15.1% ± 0.6% of the original fluorescence signal was regained (FigureS3a). Lack of refolding was confirmed by activity assays in which AiLac only recovered 1.9% ± 0.3% of its original activity in 0.1 M urea (FigureS3a). Similar results are observed for EcLac, where refolding of the protein from 6 M urea to 1 M urea resulted in 56% ± 0.7% fluorescence recovery, but only restoration of 3.8% ± 0.9% of the original activity (FigureS3b). These results showed that the unfolding of both enzymes was essentially irreversible, preventing determination of the free energy of unfolding. FIDA also revealed that theRhof the urea‐unfolded state (~ 7 nm) only decreased to a very small extent upon dilution of urea and remained well above the value of 4.2 nm seen in the absence of urea (Figure3c). This was further evidence that the early AiLac unfolding transition was irreversible.

To examine the role of structural flexibility in the activity of AiLac and EcLac, we turned to compounds known to reduce protein flexibility. Ammonium sulfate turned out to be inappropriate given its strong inhibitory effect on enzymatic activity (data not shown). Instead, we used trehalose, known to stabilize proteinsi.a. by reducing flexibility (Jain & Roy,2009), and measured its effect on both enzymes in terms of activity (ONPG hydrolysis) and stability (DSF). Trehalose decreased the activity of both AiLac and EcLac, but to different extents; at 0.5 M trehalose, AiLac and EcLac retained 50% and 75% activity, respectively (Figure3d). In contrast, AiLac was stabilized by trehalose in terms of inflection point (IP) (corresponding totm) with a factor of 10.2°C/M, which is 60% more than the 6.15°C/M of EcLac (Figure3d). These results were consistent with the expectation that cold‐active enzymes are more reliant on flexibility and therefore more sensitive than mesophilic enzymes to the decrease in flexibility caused by stabilizers.

Having established the lower thermal and chemical stability of AiLac and its relatively higher flexibility compared to EcLac, we speculated whether these stability aspects were reflected in its structural features. AiLac's tendency to aggregate precluded direct structural analysis by x‐ray crystallography or cryoEM (data not shown). Instead, we turned toin silicomodeling and utilized Alphafold 2.2 (AF2) to predict the hypothetical structure of an AiLac monomer unit. The resulting model fit well with monomer units of the structural homologs, the tetrameric EcLac (PDB entry 1JYN) (root‐mean square deviation, RMSD = 4.7 Å), the dimeric ArLac (PDB entry 6SEB) (RMSD = 7.1 Å), and the octameric TmLac (PDB entry 6S6Z) (RMSD = 3.6 Å) (Figure4). The AF2 model of AiLac predicted a structure that was identical to domains 1–5 in EcLac. Interestingly, tetrameric EcLac has a loop (residues 272–288) that completes the active site of a neighboring subunit. The sequence corresponding to this loop was not found in AiLac. Rather, AiLac had an insertion of residues 434–443 predicted to form an internal loop extending over the active site (FigureS4). This change theoretically allows for the activity of single monomeric units of AiLac in contrast to EcLac, which is only active as a tetramer (Juers et al.,2012).

De novoprediction of oligomeric states of proteins is generally difficult (Fraser et al.,2016). Homology prediction tools such as Swiss‐Model (Waterhouse et al.,2018) simply transfer information of a homolog's quaternary state to the model, which leaves the resulting modeling scores as measures of prediction quality. When we modeled AiLac in Swiss‐Model against its homologs, we obtained similar QMEANDisCo scores (1JYN, 0.70 ± 0.05; 6SEB, 0.63 ± 0.05; 6S6Z, 0.74 ± 0.05), which estimated global model quality with the structures of the said homologs (Studer et al.,2020). As no individual model scored sufficiently higher than others, we decided to experimentally establish the quaternary structure of AiLac, that is, the number of subunits per protein complex.

Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in the last protein purification step showed that AiLac gave rise to two overlapping peaks eluting at 8–11 and 11–14 mL, respectively (Figure5a). Both peaks contained a ~120 kDa protein according to SDS‐PAGE (Figure5ainsert, whole gel in FigureS5a), which is close to the theoretical 119.13 kDa of monomeric AiLac, but activity was only associated with the second peak. In contrast, both the major EcLac fractions showed activity (FigureS5b). Based on elution volumes of standardized globular proteins (FigureS5c), the second peak of AiLac corresponded to 128 kDa ± 1.3, in close agreement with the protein's monomer MW of 119 kDa. The first peak of AiLac suggested a MW of 325 ± 1.3 kDa based on elution volume. We used two approaches to obtain more exact molecular weights. Firstly, we applied SEC in combination with MALS, which confirmed the MW of the second peak to be 129.5 ± 2.9 kDa (Figure5c). In this SEC setup, the first peak was slightly better resolved into multiple overlapping peaks due to a lower injection volume (50 μL rather than 500 μL used in Figure5a). The peak around 8–10 mL consisted of a heterogeneous mixture of different species >400 kDa, suggesting aggregation, while two shoulders eluting around 10–11.5 mL had sizes of 400–500 and ~ 270 kDa, respectively, corresponding to tetramer and dimer structures, respectively. Second, we applied SAXS measurements on each of the two peaks obtained in Figure5a(FigureS5d). This led to a mass of 1994 ± 200 kDa for the first peak, corresponding to 17 ± 2 monomers, which was most likely a combination of various complexes. The second peak gave a mass of 211 ± 21 kDa corresponding to 1.7 ± 0.2 monomers. The SAXS curve for the first peak showed a significant decrease in intensity at mid‐qrange was significantly decreased compared to the second peak (FigureS5d), suggesting loss of tertiary structure. This is consistent with a scenario in which the first peak contains a combination of aggregates and other large complexes, as also observed in MALS intensity of scattered light (Rθ) data (green line, Figure5b). This scenario also explains the peak's lack of enzymatic activity (Figure5a). The large differences in mass obtained in SAXS compared to the other techniques may be a time effect, as our SAXS measurements each take 0.5 h.

(d) SAXS data of 1.15 mg/mL AiLac fitted with either the AF2 dimer (red) or the modified AF2 dimer from simulation 6 optimized by Monte Carlo simulations (blue). The structure for each of these structures is shown in the same color as the fit. The blue arrows indicate that the blue modified structure is slightly more open than the red unmodified structure. The right inset shows the three parts of the dimer (green, cyan, and magenta) that were allowed to move relative to each other during the Monte Carlo simulations. (e) The effect of protein concentration on self‐association and stability. 125 nM fluorescently labelled WT AiLac (blue circles) or 60 nM TM AiLac (green triangles) was titrated against unlabelled enzyme (WT or TM, respectively) in buffer A measured by FIDA (lefty‐axis). Thermal stability of AiLac at different protein concentrations was measured by DSF, represented as melting temperaturetm(righty‐axis) and shown by red squares for WT AiLac and light blue diamonds for TM AiLac. Both data sets are fitted to Equation (5). All experiments are performed in PBS pH 7.0 with 0.1 mM Mg2+. The semi‐transparent arrows indicate shifts inRhortmvalues due to mutagenesis. (f) Mass photometric analysis of the MW of WT and TM AiLac. Clearly, TM has undergone a significant increase in mass, consistent with tetramer formation.

SAXS data for AiLac's second peak showed a mass corresponding to 1.7 ± 0.2 monomers, that is, close to a dimer. When AF2 is asked to predict a dimer structure, this leads to an arrangement where monomers interact along a single interface in their C‐termini (Figure5c). We calculated the expected scattering of the AF2 dimer model and fitted it to the measured data, varying only the concentration, a parameter describing the hydration around the protein, and a constant background. We obtained a reasonable fit with a reduced χ2value of 13.8 and a concentration of 1.046 ± 0.009 mg/mL, which was close to the expected concentration of 1.15 mg/mL (red line in Figure5d, summarized in TableS2). This suggests that the AF2 dimer model is a good representation of the solution structure of AiLac. While the fit was visually good, small deviations were seen for the entireqrange (Figure5d). To resolve this, the dimeric structure was split into three parts that were allowed to move relative to each other during a Monte Carlo optimization that also includes distance restraints along the backbone and excluded volume penalties (three parts shown in green, cyan, and magenta in the right inset in Figure5d). We justified this on the basis that they are connected by loop regions, which should allow them to move relative to one another in solution. The connections are between V626 and S327 for both of the constituting monomers. The connections of the two monomers were kept as predicted by Alphafold2. Ten individual Monte Carlo simulations were performed to optimize the structure against the measured SAXS data. For these ten simulations, an average χ2value of 2.89 ± 0.10 was obtained (TableS2shows values for individual simulations). This was a significant improvement, although the resulting structures only had an average RMSD of 3.0 ± 0.5 Å compared to the original structure (RMSD values for the individual structures are shown in TableS2). An example of the best fit (simulation 6) is seen in Figure5das the blue line calculated from the blue structure (left inset in Figure5d). The blue and red structures are overlaid in the left inset of Figure5d, which shows that they are very similar. However, the blue modified structure is slightly more open than the red structure, as indicated by the blue arrows.

The SAXS, SEC, and SEC‐MALS experiments were performed at relatively high (1–3 mg/mL) protein concentrations, which might promote oligomerization. To probe dimerization over a wider concentration range, we used flow‐induced dispersion analysis, FIDA, which provides theRhof fluorescently labelled protein and can be performed at concentrations down to a few μg/mL. To monitor transitions between different states over a 1000‐fold range in concentrations, we titrated fluorescently labeled AiLac with increasing amounts of non‐labeled AiLac (blue data points in Figure5e).Rhof the labeled protein increased from 4.3 ± 0.1 nm at 32 nM (4 μg/mL) to 5.8 ± 0.03 nm at 33.5 μM (4 mg/mL). Gratifyingly, the FIDA PDB size predictor program predictedRhto be 4.2 and 5.7 nm for monomeric and dimeric AiLac, respectively, using the SAXS‐optimized AF2 structure. EcLacRhwas measured to be 6.5 ± 0.1 nm, which corresponded well with a predicted value of 6.7 nm. Our AiLac data could be fitted with a monomer‐dimer association model (Equation (5)), leading to a dissociation constant (KD) of 0.23 ± 0.20 μM (blue line in Figure5e). Having established that AiLac forms a homodimer in a concentration‐dependent manner, we investigated whether the quaternary structure affected the stability of the enzyme. To do this, we utilized DSF at various enzyme concentrations. Plotting melting temperatures (tm) of DSF unfolding curves revealed that a high concentration of AiLac indeed increased AiLac's thermal stability (red data points in Figure5e). Going from 33 nM to 33.5 μM increasestmby 5.7°C. Fitting the stability data to Equation (5) gave aKDappof 0.15 ± 0.09 μM (red line in Figure5e), in good agreement with FIDA data.

Protein sequences, evolved over billions of years, harbor extensive information about structural and functional constraints. Evolution‐based machine learning models, trained on individual protein families, have shown promising results in predicting protein structure from residue co‐variation (Jumper et al.,2021; Morcos et al.,2011) and designing novel sequences that are stable and functional (Russ et al.,2020; Tian et al.,2018; Tian et al.,2022). These models are also effective in predicting single mutational effects predicted on protein sequence fitness (Hopf et al.,2017). However, the extent to which evolutionary information captured by these models can be used to design proteins with higher‐order oligomerization remains unclear. We hypothesized that most GH2β‐galactosidases are more stable than AiLac due to stable oligomeric conformations such as tetramers. By capturing the evolutionary pattern of AiLac homologs, we aimed to identify mutations that could shift the oligomerization preference toward dimer and tetramer, thereby enhancing the stability. Deep learning methods are very powerful in learning high‐dimensional data distributions (Lopez et al.,2018; Rezende et al.,2014). In this study, we constructed an evolutionary model of the GH2β‐galactosidase family using a Bayesian Variational Autoencoder model called EVE (Frazer et al.,2021). We sought to determine whether higher‐order oligomeric assembly could be induced through evolutionarily favorable mutations identified by the model at the dimeric interface. Table2lists the top 11 single mutations based on the evolutionary fitness score suggested by the model. We focus on the top three candidates, namely V648E, F702L, and T742V. While the last two mutations are conservative amino acid replacements, the mutation V548E represents a more significant change. We hypothesize that this substitution may stabilize quaternary interactions since Val648 is located at the dimer interface, and replacing it with Glu could introduce hydrogen bonds or salt bridges with nearby residues on the adjacent subunit, strengthening dimer/tetramer interactions. We produced both single mutant constructs and a triple mutant (TM) using USER cloning site‐directed mutagenesis to investigate their impact on the structure and stability of AiLac. Upon gel filtration of all four constructs, we observed a significant shift in the distribution of the oligomeric states as seen by the comparatively higher intensity of the initial elution peak (FigureS7). In contrast to the WT AiLac, both peaks contained active enzyme, suggesting that the higher‐order species of the mutant fold into active structures. We then utilized FIDA to investigate whether we could measure the oligomeric state of the higher‐order assembly observed by SEC, and for this, we chose to focus on the TM variant of AiLac. Attempts to confirm the oligomeric assembly using SAXS were unsuccessful due to aggregation (data not shown). Instead, we used two complementary approaches to investigate quaternary structure, namely mass photometry (MP) and FIDA. MP uses interferometric scattering (which scales with mass) to estimate the MW of individual molecules (Young et al.,2018). Application to TM reveals a remarkably clear shift in mass from ~120 to ~420 kDa, consistent with tetramerization (Figure5f). For FIDA, we titrated unlabeled protein to a small amount of labeled protein and measured theRh(blue line, Figure5e). Gratifyingly, we observed that the AiLac TM has aRhof a dimer already at the lowest measured concentration, which assembles into a tetramer as the concentration approaches 10 μM. Furthermore, we also measured the thermal stability of AiLac TM across the titration series and once again observed a trend of increasingtmas a function of protein concentration (orange line, Figure5e). AiLac TM has a significantly highertmof 40.8 ± 1.9°C at 32.8 nM, which increases to 42.0 ± 0.1°C at 4.2 μM. Furthermore, similar increased thermal stabilities are seen for all three single mutants as well (FigureS8), which aligns well with the observed peak shifts in the gel filtration experiments (FigureS7). Overall, our experiments confirmed that these high evolutionary fitness mutations successfully shift the propensity toward tetramerization and improve evolutionary fitness while maintaining functionality. These findings can serve as a general protein engineering principle for modulating protein oligomerization.

Prediction of stabilizing mutations at the dimeric interface of AiLac obtained by the evolutionary model EVE (Frazer et al.,2021).

Lower value means higher fitness.

The motivation for our study of the AiLacβ‐galactosidase was to understand how the stability and structure of AiLac influence activity at low temperature. We discovered that AiLac associates with a highly unstable dimer, whose formation is protein concentration dependent. Furthermore, the dimerization enhances the thermal stability of AiLac. We were able to induce further oligomerization by inducing stabilizing mutations at the dimer interface, which led to the formation of AiLac in a dimer‐tetramer equilibrium and further increased the thermal stability of the protein.

AiLac has a temperature optimum at 30°C and 2–3 times higher specific activity toward ONPG than EcLac at 5–30°C, which makes AiLac a classic example of a cold‐active enzyme (Cavicchioli & Siddiqui,2006; Feller & Gerday,2003; Fields & Somero,1998). The biphasic aspect of the kinetics might arise from a heterotrophic active site that is activated at high substrate concentrations (Tracy & Hummel,2004). Far‐UV and near‐UV CD thermal denaturation experiments showed major unfolding events attm= 34°C ortm= 34.7°C, respectively. However, far‐UV also showed a slight loss of 222 nm signal attm= 23.3°C, which indicates an early rearrangement involvingα‐helical structures. This fits well withVmaxdependency on temperature, where we observed a change of slope at temperatures above 25°C. These two observations are likely connected, as a deviation from linearity between ln(kcat)/TandT−1is likely caused by either thermal denaturation or a temperature‐dependent reversible inactivation. An alternative explanation is a non‐linear difference in heat capacity, ΔCp‡, signifying temperature‐dependent change dynamics of protein rearrangement during catalysis, for example, lid opening (Nguyen et al.,2017). However, the changes in far‐UV CD spectra around 23°C suggest local structural rearrangements as a simpler explanation. The local nature of this change is supported by the fact that global changes observed by near‐UV CD, FIDA, and SAXS all occur ≥30°C. Loss of activity at lower temperatures than that of global unfolding is one of the characteristic traits of psychrophilic enzymes (Feller & Gerday,2003). It is unclear whether this is also the case for AiLac; certainly, there is no major loss in activity at this temperature, but more subtle changes may affect the otherwise steep rise in activity with temperature in this interval.

Psychrophilic enzymes tend to be less stable than their mesophilic and thermophilic homologs due to an increase in structural flexibility (Feller & Gerday,1997). A superoxide dismutase from the psychrophilicPseudoalteromonas haloplanktishas a midpoint of denaturation of 4.2 M urea compared to 8.2 M urea of its mesophilic homolog fromE. coli(Merlino et al.,2010). A psychrophilicα‐amylase fromP. haloplanktishas a midpoint of transition at 0.9 M guanidine, whereas the mesophilic counterpart from pig pancreas has its midpoint at 2.6 M guanidine (Feller et al.,1999) (note that guanidine is a stronger denaturant than urea, typically being twice as efficient (Lim et al.,2009; Rashid et al.,2005)). Even by the standards of unstable psychrophilic enzymes, AiLac is remarkably sensitive to perturbation. Urea titration measured by aromatic fluorescence shows that the psychrophilic enzyme unfolds by two transitions. The first, involving loss of function with a [urea]50%of 0.67 M, is dramatically lower than the 5 M midpoint for unfolding and loss of function of EcLac. The initial AiLac transition involves an increase in particle size, no matter whether measured at high (SAXS) or low (FIDA) protein concentrations, suggesting that cooperative unfolding is independent of quaternary structure. A 119 kDa protein would have anRhof 11.6 nm andRgof 12.6 nm, assuming a fully unfolded state (Wilkins et al.,1999). However, FIDA data showed anRhtransition to a ⁓7 nm particle at 1 M urea, which is nevertheless larger than a folded monomer (Rh= 4.4 nm). SAXS measurements showed a transition from anRgvalue of 5.2 nm in buffer to 11.9 nm when unfolded in urea and 4.4–12 nm when heated from 20 to 35°C (TableS1). Utilizing the FIDA size predictor, which can predict bothRhandRg, a monomer would have anRgof 3.3 nm, while the dimer is predicted to be 4.4 nm. The latter corresponds to the initial size of AiLac in the SAXS experiments, suggesting that a dimeric structure is maintained before unfolding. Therefore, the data indicate that the transition is to an unfolded species, no matter whether a monomer or a multimer is the starting point. Furthermore, unfolding through this transition is irreversible in terms of both activity and stability, as only approximately 2% of activity is observed upon refolding, 15% of the fluorescence shift signal is restored, and no decrease inRhwas observed using FIDA upon refolding. The connection between stability and flexibility is important, as sensitivity toward perturbants is not necessarily an adaptive feature reflecting high flexibility. Therefore, we assessed the effect of trehalose on AiLac and compared it to EcLac. Trehalose is an organic osmolyte whose stabilizing effect has been linked to a decrease in structural flexibility of proteins (Fedorov et al.,2011). Indeed, we saw that AiLac is significantly more affected by trehalose than EcLac, both in terms of loss of activity and stability. This strongly suggests that AiLac has a more flexible structure at room temperature (RT) than EcLac and that its high activity is connected to its instability at elevated temperatures.

SEC analysis combined with MALS indicated that the AiLac enzyme is a functional monomer. However, SAXS experiments combined with the AlphaFold model presented an elongated dimer as the most likely structure for AiLac. Although the initial protein concentration was similar in both experiments, we suspected that dilution of AiLac across the gel filtration column caused monomerization of the protein. The discrepancy between SEC‐MALS and SAXS was solved using FIDA, which showed that the monomers form dimers in a concentration‐dependent manner with aKD= 0.3 μM (36 μg/mL). This observation means that while the enzyme functions as a monomer under activity assessment conditions (typically 8 nM), we will mainly observe a dimeric structure at concentrations needed for SAXS (typically 8 μM). Furthermore, DSF measurements of AiLac at different concentrations showed that dimerization increases enzyme stability, which is important for the interpretation of experiments performed under various conditions. Interestingly, isothermal unfolding with urea measured by SAXS does not show increased stability compared to FIDA measurements, despite expected dimerization and its effect on stability. This discrepancy may be explained by differences in the experimental set‐ups and aggregation caused by high protein concentration. Few studies reporting on protein structure investigate concentration‐dependent oligomerization. Therefore, it is difficult to estimate the true oligomeric state of an enzyme at assay conditions unless it is specifically investigated.

There is high diversity in oligomeric formation of structural homologs to AiLac. The closest structural homologs include the dimericβ‐galactosidase fromArthrobactersp. 32cB (Rutkiewicz et al.,2019), the tetrameric EcLac fromE. coli(Matthews,2005), and the octamericβ‐galactosidase from the thermophilicThermotoga maritima(Míguez Amil et al.,2020). Since AiLac shows the highest amino acid sequence similarity to enzymes with the homotetrameric structure of EcLac, we expected AiLac to form a tetramer. EcLac is exclusively functional in its fully assembled tetrameric state, as the active site is completed by a loop extending from the neighboring subunit (Juers et al.,2012). This same loop is not conserved in AiLac, and therefore, it is not expected that multimerization would be required for enzymatic activity. Low conservation in this loop region is not unique to AiLac, however. Neither of the structural homologs present this type of intermolecular active site completion, and both the thermo‐ and psychrophilicβ‐galactosidases have a more solvent‐exposed binding site than EcLac. Interestingly, the AlphaFold model predicted another loop occupying the same space but one from the same subunit (residues 508–518 in AiLac amino acid numeration).

It is noteworthy that the AiLac dimer resembles one half of the EcLac tetramer interacting across the activating interface. This is different from the dimeric structure of theβ‐galactosidase fromArthrobactersp. 32cB (ArLac), which has a “head‐to‐tail” interaction across the monomers with the active site facing toward the interface (Rutkiewicz et al.,2019). A structural study of ArLac revealed that its unique dimeric arrangement minimizes buried surface area (8.9%), which represents a large fraction of solvent‐exposed amino acid area of a multimer compared to a monomer. This is similar to the psychrophilic homologs (14.7%) and is significantly lower than the meso‐ and thermophilic homologs (22.4%–32.5%). This observation was linked to cold adaptation. Note that even lesser buried surface area is observed for our dimeric AiLac model (3.3%), suggesting that cold adaptation of the AiLac enzyme involves minimization of buried surface area.

Our findings of induced multimerization in the single and the triple mutants predicted by an evolutionary model show that very few additional interactions between the monomeric units are necessary to stabilize the dimer structure and extend it to a tetrameric state, as demonstrated by mass photometry, which in turn also equipped the enzyme with increased thermal stability. This shows not only that our protein design method is highly efficient at identifying these kinds of mutations but also that changes in quaternary structure are evolutionarily highly accessible through a small number of mutations. We also note that according to both the AlphaFold‐based dimer model and the SAXS data, the three mutations (V648E, F702L, and T742V) are clustered at or near the subunit‐subunit interface rather than near the catalytic cleft. In AiLac, the active site is largely formed by intramolecular loops (notably residues 434–443, predicted to occupy the substrate‐binding region within the same chain). Because none of the three engineered substitutions lie in or near the substrate‐binding groove, they do not directly perturb the substrate‐binding loops or catalytic residues. This spatial separation helps explain why the enzyme retains activity even though the mutants significantly alter oligomerization behavior. Moreover, unlike the tetrameric E. coliβ‐galactosidase (where part of the active site is formed by a neighboring subunit's loop), AiLac's monomer appears to carry its own complete catalytic machinery. Thus, engineering additional contacts at the dimer interface can improve stability without disturbing the essential geometry of the catalytic site.

Oligomeric state, stability, and activity of AiLac are all highly dependent on pH. AiLac showed the highest activity in acidic solutions; however, at 20°C it aggregated below neutral pH and formed amorphous multimers above neutral pH. Altogether, these data showed that AiLac experiences a tight balance between activity and stability in regard to activity with a narrow window of function around neutral pH. Under these conditions, we have shown that the enzyme forms a dimer that dissociates into monomers at low concentrations. Oligomerization into higher‐order assemblies as a mechanism of thermostabilization is well established, although in most cases it has been proposed mainly through indirect evidence based on thermally stable, high‐order proteins from thermophilic bacteria and archaea (Míguez Amil et al.,2020; Robinson‐Rechavi et al.,2006; Walden et al.,2001). Conceptually, this makes good sense since oligomerization makes unfolding more difficult (and therefore stabilizes the protein) because both inter‐ and intramolecular contacts need to be broken. Besides this, there is additional evidence. For example, SDS resistance has been linked to oligomerization (Manning & Colón,2004), and artificially oligomerized proteins, either through engineering orde novoevolution, have been shown to result in increased stability (Fraser et al.,2016; Kirsten Frank et al.,2002; Kuhlman et al.,2001). We also demonstrate that AiLac dimerization at higher protein concentration increases thermal stability. Whether de‐oligomerization of enzymes is an active adaptation toward efficient catalysis at low temperatures or a passive loss of high‐temperature activity remains controversial. In a wider scope, all six isolatedA. ikkensisrelatives, which also produceβ‐galactosidases, happen to be mesophilic bacteria with halophilic tendencies, but with no psychrophiles among them (TableS3). In four of these, theβ‐galactosidase genes and their respective flanking sequences are syntenic (i.e., close in the bacterial genome) to that of AiLac (FigureS6), showing the conservation of the whole cluster. The high identity of the AiLac sequence and its respective cluster collinearity among the relatives indicates thatA. ikkensisis a mesophilic bacterium that has adapted toward survival in the cold environment of the Ikaite columns relatively recently in its evolutionary history. This is supported by the fact that the Greenlandic ice sheet covered the Ikka Fjord until ca. 8000 years ago, and thus, the maximal age of the ikaite columns is approximately 8000 years (Buchardt et al.,2001). Furthermore, we have previously shown that the majority of bacteria isolated from ikaite columns are eurypsychrophilic (activity spanning a broad range of temperatures) and not stenopsychrophilic (narrow‐range activity) (Schmidt et al.,2006; Stougaard et al.,2002). Nonetheless, our work suggests a link between low stability, high flexibility, and high activity at low temperatures of AiLac and its relation to the unique dimer arrangement that dissociates to monomers at low enzyme concentrations, which we were able to modify to form a tetramer through a triple mutation that has high evolutionary fitness at the dimerization interface.

The following buffers were used: buffer A (phosphate buffer saline +0.1 mM MgCl2): 2.7 mM KCl, 8 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM KH2PO4, 137 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM MgCl2pH 7.0; buffer B (binding): buffer A + 10 mM imidazole; buffer C (washing); buffer A + 40 mM imidazole; buffer D (elution): buffer A + 400 mM imidazole; buffer E (circular dichroism): 10 mM sodium phosphate, 0.1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.0.

E. coliBL21(DE3) cells were transformed with a pET9a(USER) plasmid carrying the gene encoding AiLac (EC# 3.2.1.23; GenBankACO52514.1). Recombinant cells were plated on LB agar containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin (Km50), incubated overnight at 37°C, and suspended in 20 mL LB Km50 medium. The pre‐culture was used to inoculate 1 L LB Km50 and incubated at 37°C, 150 rpm. When the culture reached OD600= 0.8, expression was induced with 0.1 mM Isopropyl ß‐d‐1‐thiogalactopyranoside and 1 mM rhamnose, and the temperature was reduced to 18°C. After 4 h of additional growth, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000gfor 30 min in 1 L flasks at 4°C in a Sorvall Lynx 6000 centrifuge (Thermo). The cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mL binding buffer (buffer B) and the cells were lysed by 10 min of sonication using a 2 mm Microtip probe mounted to a Q500 sonicator (Qsonica, Connecticut, USA) set to 20 s pulse/pause intervals at 20% intensity. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000gfor 20 min at 4°C in 50 mL tubes, and the supernatant was kept at −20°C before purification. Thawed lysate was filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter and loaded onto 2 mL Ni2+‐charged Ni‐NTA beads in a 15 mL plastic column, followed by 15 min of incubation on a rotating table at 4°C. The lysate was eluted, and the beads were washed with 5 column volumes of buffer C. The protein was eluted with 2 column volumes of buffer D, and the eluate was immediately exchanged to buffer A using disposable PD‐10 columns (Cytiva, Marlborough, USA) following standard gravity protocol. Purity was assessed by SDS‐PAGE, and the protein was stored at −80°C.

Further purification and size estimation were performed by SEC using a Superdex 200 Inc. column (Cytiva, Marlborough, USA) connected to an Äkta Pure 25 M system (Cytiva, Marlborough, USA). The flow was set to 0.5 mL/min, and 0.5 mL of 3 mg/mL protein solution was injected. The protein eluted at 8–14 mL and was collected in 0.5 mL fractions. Protein concentration, purity, and activity of each fraction were assessed by absorption at 280 nm, SDS‐PAGE, and ONPG activity assays, respectively. Proteins for size comparison purchased from Sigma in lyophilized form— hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL), carbonic anhydrase (CA), bovine serum albumin (BSA), and EcLac— were dissolved in PBS pH 7.0 to a 1 mg/mL concentration and run on SEC with the same column and settings as AiLac.

Activity of the AiLac and EcLac (purchased from Sigma) was assessed by hydrolysis of ONPG. The experiments were performed either utilizing a single cell set‐up with a Lambda 25 UV/VIS spectrophotometer connected to PTP‐1 Peltier system (Perkin Elmer, Massachusetts, USA) using 10 mm quartz cuvettes (Hellma, Switzerland) or a plate‐reader set‐up with Varioscan LUX microplate reader (Fisher, Massachusetts, USA) using Nunc 96‐well Clear Plates (Fisher, Massachusetts, USA). The reactions were initiated by adding 0.2 mg/mL enzyme stock, yielding 1 μg/mL (8 nM) final concentration, and were followed by absorption reading at 420 nm. The reaction rate is expressed in μmol product per minute per mg enzyme (U/mg) using an extinction coefficient of hydrolyzed ONPG at the relevant pH, ONP‐ being the light‐absorbing species with εONP‐= 4600 M−1cm−1and pKa = 7.2, giving the pH dependenceεpH=εONP−∙fONP−=εONP−∙10pH−pKa1+10pH−pKa(= 1741 M−1cm−1at pH 7.0).

Biphasic kinetics are modeled according to the sequential binding scheme:

Here,Eis the enzyme,Sis the substrate, andK1andK2are the equilibrium dissociation constants for the first and second binding step. This leads to the following equation:

Magnesium dependency titration data is fitted with the following equation, adapted from Mogensen et al., (2005):

wherekcata,kcatb, andkcatcare rate constants with zero, one, and two Mg2+ions bound, respectively.KAandKBare dissociation constants for the binding of the first and second Mg2+ions, respectively.

Thermal stability was assessed on a Chirascan‐plus CD spectropolarimeter (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK) in combination with a TC1 Temperature controller (Quantum Northwest, Liberty Lake, USA). Far‐UV and near‐UV experiments were performed at 190–260 nm and 250–320 nm, respectively. For far‐UV experiments, 300 μL of protein at 0.2 mg/mL (unless stated otherwise in Results section) was transferred to a 1 mm quartz cuvette (Hellma, Switzerland), while near‐UV experiments were performed using 1 mL of 0.5 mg/mL (unless stated otherwise in “Results” section) in a 5 mm quartz cuvette (Hellma, Switzerland). In both experiments, the CD was set to 1 nm bandwidth, 0.5 s time per point, single repeat, and overwrite set temperature with temperature measured in the cuvette. The unfolding data were fitted using Global 3 Thermal Global Analysis Software (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK) using a linear baseline for both native and unfolded states.

Thermal stability of AiLac and EcLac in trehalose was assessed with a Tycho NT.6 (Nanotemper, München, Germany) using the ratio of emission at 330 and 350 nm (excitation at 280 nm) and a pre‐set scanning rate of 30°C/min at 80% laser power. The protein concentration was 0.15 mg/mL in buffer A. Prior to these assays, SEC‐purified protein in buffer A was incubated in 0–1 M trehalose for 4 h at RT.

Thermal stability of AiLac at different protein concentrations was performed on Nanotemper Panta (Nanotemper, München, Germany) using the ratio of emission at 330 and 350 nm (excitation at 280 nm) at 7% laser power and a scanning rate of 0.5°C/min. SEC‐purified AiLac was measured at concentrations between 4 mg/mL and 3.9 μg/mL. Thermal stability was assessed using built‐in software by calculating the mid‐point of denaturation as the IP seen as a peak in the plot of the first derivative of the signal versus temperature.

Protein stability was assessed by fluorescence and CD after incubation in various urea (UltraPure) concentrations. Trp fluorescence was measured with a Varioscan LUX microplate reader (Fisher, Massachusetts, USA) at RT using Nunc 96‐well Black Bottom Plates (Fisher, Massachusetts, USA). Samples (150 μL in triplicates) contained 0.2 mg/mL protein and were incubated for 6 h at RT to achieve equilibrium. They were excited at 280 nm while emission was measured from 310 to 450 nm using a 5 nm bandwidth and 100 ms per point. For a two‐state (sigmoidal) transition, the resulting data are fitted to the following equation (Fersht et al.,1999):

αNandαDare baseline signals for the native and the denatured states, respectively, at 0 M urea, whereasβNandβDare the respective baseline slopes. [urea]50%is the urea concentration at whichKD‐N= [D]/[N] = 1.mD‐Ndescribes the linear relationship between logKD‐Nand [urea]. In the case of a three‐state transition (double sigmoidal), the following equation was used:

This equation is an expanded version of Equation (1) with added intermediate signal baseline (αI) and baseline slope (βI), together with [urea]50%(I)whereKI‐N= [I]/[N] = 1 and [den]50%(D)whereKD‐I= [D]/[I] = 1.mI‐NandmD‐Idescribe the linear relationships between logKI‐Nand logKD‐N, respectively, and [urea].

SAXS data were obtained on NanoSTAR from Bruker AXS (Karlsruhe, Germany) at Aarhus University. The instrument is flux optimized with a liquid gallium metal jet x‐ray source from excillum (Kista, Sweden) and homebuilt scatterless slits. More information on the optimized instrument can be found here (Lyngso & Pedersen,2021). Background subtraction and conversion to absolute scale using a measured water sample at 20°C was carried out using the SUPERSAXS program software package (Oliveira, C.L.P. and Pedersen, J.S., unpublished). Data are plotted as a function ofq, which is the modulus of the scattering vector. It is defined asq=4sinθ/λ, where 2θis the angle between the incident and scattered beam, andλis the wavelength, which isλGa=1.34Åfor this instrument. All samples were measured for 1800 s at 20°C using buffer A unless otherwise stated. To determine the pH dependency, samples of 0.40 mg/mL AiLac were prepared with pH ranging from 6.0 to 9.5. pH was adjusted by titration of HCl or NaOH to 50 mM bis‐tris propane. However, only samples from pH 7.0 to 9.5 were measured, as samples at pH 6.0 and 6.5 showed large visible aggregates. The mass was determined byM=I0×NA/c×Δρm2, whereI(0) is the intensity extrapolated toq= 0,NAis Avogadro's number,cis the protein concentration is mg/mL, andΔρmis the scattering contrast per mass. For a typical protein, this can be estimated to2.0×1010cm/g. Mass determinations done by SAXS have an uncertainty of around 10%, as they rely on the precision of the concentration determination, the uncertainty of estimatingI(0), and how well the protein in question fits with standard value for the scattering contrast per mass used in the equation. SAXS data were also obtained for both peaks from the SEC purification. The first peak has a concentration of 0.85 mg/mL and the second peak a concentration of 1.15 mg/mL. For the modeling of the dimer structure, we first compared the scattering of the Alphafold predicted dimer to data. This was done by calculating the theoretical scattering curve using the program wlsq_pdbx (Steiner et al.,2018). This program fits the concentration, hydration contribution, and a constant background.

To further optimize the structure, it was divided into three parts separated by loop regions. These three parts could move relative to each other when performing ten individual Monte Carlo optimizations, each with 100 steps. The program includes soft distance restraints along the backbone between the parts as well as excluded volume penalties. When running the simulations, the program automatically calculates an expected concentration, which can be done as the data are on an absolute scale. After the simulations, each structure was aligned to the Alphafold dimer and a root mean square deviation (RMSD) value was calculated. Values from the simulations are given either on an individual basis or as an average of the ten simulations, with the standard deviation listed as the uncertainty. Urea dependence of AiLac structure was investigated by measuring AiLac with a concentration of 1.2 mg/mL at increasing urea concentrations. The sizes in the form of radius of gyration (Rg) were obtained using the model‐independent indirect Fourier transformation developed by Glatter (1977). Temperature dependence on AiLac structure was investigated by increasing the temperature gradually for a sample of 1.10 mg/mL AiLac. The temperature was raised by 5°C and the sample was equilibrated for 150 s before the next 1800 s measurement started.

The structure of full sequence AiLac (GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession no.FJ811841) was predicted using a modified version of DeepMind's AlphaFold 2.2 (AF2) (Jumper et al.,2021) ParallelFold v1.1 (ParaFold) (Zhong et al.,2022). The monomeric structure was modelled using “monomer_preset” while the dimeric structure was modelled by selecting “multimer_preset” with two AiLac sequences in succession.

200 μg of AiLac in buffer A purified by SEC was fluorescently tagged with Alexa Fluor 488 NHS Ester (Succinimidyl Ester) (Invitrogen, Massachusetts, USA) by adding 10% V/V 1 M sodium bicarbonate and 2.4 μL of 7.2 mM Alexa 488 stock (1:3 protein to label molar ratio), followed by 3 h incubation in the dark at 20°C on a rolling table. Free label was removed by desalting on a disposable PD MidiTrap G‐25 column (Cytiva, Marlborough, USA) following the standard gravity protocol. FIDA was performed using a FIDA 1 platform (Fida Biosystems, Søborg, Denmark). Here, 125 nM (WT AiLac) or 60 nM (TM AiLac) labeled protein was utilized as an indicator molecule with various amounts (0–1 mg/mL) of non‐labeled AiLac used as analyte. 62.5 and 31.5 nM measurements of WT AiLac were performed by serial dilution of the 125 nM labeled sample. The labeled AiLac was pre‐mixed with unlabeled AiLac at different concentrations and was incubated at 4°C for 4 h before starting the experiment. The resulting elution curve was fitted to a two‐species model using standard fitting (75% of curve length) with one hydrodynamic radius (Rh) locked to 0.6 nm, representing unbound label. The resultingRhvalues calculated in the FIDA software were fit to the following equations:

whereRhmonomerandRhdimerare sizes from monomer and dimer, respectively. [M0] is the initial monomer concentration, while [D] is dimer concentration obtained by solving a quadratic equation for the equilibrium:

whereKDis the dissociation constant of the dimer into themonomer.

A Superdex 200 10/300 GL Inc. gel filtration column (Cytiva, Marlborough, USA) was connected to a 1260 Infinity II Liquid Chromatography System (Agilent, USA). The light scattering signal was detected downstream of the column by a DAWN8+ MALS detector (Wyatt, Dernbach, Germany) (λ = 658 nm); the refraction index (RI) was measured by an Optilab T‐rEX RI detector (Wyatt, Dernbach, Germany) (λ = 658 nm) and UV absorbance was measured by the UV detector (λ = 280 nm) built into the liquid chromatography system. Hvad med R(theta) som du også henviser til? The experiments were performed at room temperature. The system was pre‐equilibrated with buffer A at a constant 1 mL/min flow, and the detectors were calibrated with 20 μL 2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin. Ni‐NTA purified protein was thawed and spun at 13,000 rpm for aggregate removal, and 50 μL of 1.5 mg/mL protein was loaded by the auto sampler. The sample was loaded and eluted at a constant 0.5 mL/min flow in injection mode. The results were processed in Astra 7.1.1 software (Wyatt, Dernbach, Germany).

We built an evolution‐based model for the AiLac protein homologs using a Bayesian Variational Autoencoder called EVE (Frazer et al.,2021). Specifically, for this deep neural network, both the encoder and decoder were configured with three layers. The hidden layer sizes for the encoder were set to 2000, 1000, and 300, respectively, while those for the decoder were set to 300, 1000, and 2000, respectively. A total of 40,000 epochs were used for the training process. This model learns the probabilistic distribution over 8544 natural sequences extracted from the UniRef100 database (Suzek et al.,2007). The protein homolog search method JackHMMER was employed with parameters set to anE‐value of 10−4and eight iterations. Sequences with more than 25% gaps were discarded, (Johnson et al.,2010) and sequences within 95% sequence identity were removed from the training set.

Using the model, we derived the “evolutionary fitness score” for each amino acid variant, which estimates the relative likelihood of the variant compared to the wild type, by sampling from the approximate posterior distribution of the VAE. We focused on mutations at the intermolecular interface of the AiLac dimer structure, which was obtained by fitting to our SAX data. A pair of residues is defined as being in contact if any heavy atoms of any either residue were within 5.5 Å.

Mutagenesis of the WT AiLac was performed directly on the pET9a(USER) plasmid containing the AiLac sequence utilizing Site‐Directed PCR Mutagenesis USER Cloning (Geu‐Flores et al.,2007). The primers for the three single mutations (V648E, F702L, T742V) were designed using the AMUSER software (Genee et al.,2015). The TM was created by three consecutive rounds of mutagenesis using V648E, F702L, T742V primers, respectively. The plasmid was modified using PCR with the following conditions: an initial denaturation at 98°C for 30 s, followed by 30 cycles of 98°C for 19 s, 67°C (dependent on primer melting temperature) for 30 s, and 72°C for 3 min, with a final extension at 72°C for 3 min. The PCR mixture consisted of 19 μL Milli‐Q water, 2.5 μL forward primer, 2.5 μL reverse primer, 1 μL template DNA (approximately 50 ng/μL plasmid), and 25 μL PhusionU polymerase. The PCR product was purified using the GeneJET PCR Purification Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and purified DNA was then treated with USER enzyme to create sticky ends by incubating a reaction mixture containing 1 μL 10× Cutsmart buffer, 8 μL DNA, 0.5 μL DpnI, and 0.5 μL USER enzyme at 37°C for 1 h. The modified plasmid DNA was chemically transformed into XL1‐Blue cells. Transformation involved thawing chemically competent XL1‐Blue cells on ice, adding 5 μL of the reaction mixture to the cells, and incubating on ice for 20 min. The cells were then heat‐shocked at 42°C for 2 min, followed by incubation with 0.5 mL LB at 37°C for 1 h. Transformed cells were plated on kanamycin agar plates, and 4 colonies were picked for plasmid purification and subsequent sequencing, which was performed using the Mix2Seq service by Eurofins Genomics. Plasmid DNA (5 μL at 50–100 ng/μL) was mixed with 5 μL of 1X sequencing primer provided in the Mix2Seq kit, and the samples were sequenced by Eurofins Genomics.

The molecular mass of the proteins was measured on a TwoMP mass photometer (Refeyn, Oxford, England) at RT (21°C). Microscope slides (24 × 50 mm, 170 ± 5 μm, No. 1.5H, Paul Marienfeld, Germany) were cleaned sequentially by water bath sonication with Milli‐Q water, isopropanol, and Milli‐Q water again, then dried using a clean nitrogen stream. Eight‐well reusable silicone gaskets (CultureWell™ 50–3 mm DIA × 1 mm depth, 3–10 μL, Grace Bio‐Labs, Oregon, USA) were cut and assembled at the center of the cover slide. The system was calibrated by separately measuring the ratiometric contrast of BSA (66 kDa monomer, 132 kDa dimer) and thyroglobulin (670 kDa) at a final concentration of 20 nM. Calibration was performed by placing an 18 μL droplet of buffer in a well to enable focusing on the glass surface, followed by the addition of 2 μL of protein. To minimize the dissociation of molecular assemblies of AiLac, a higher dilution factor was used. Focusing was achieved using 19.75 μL of standard buffer, to which 0.25 μL of protein was directly added from a 1 mg/mL (8.4 μM) stock solution. This resulted in a final protein concentration of approximately 100 nM. DiscoverMP software (Refeyn Ltd., Oxford, UK) was used to generate distribution histograms, with average masses, peak width, and counts determined by Gaussian fitting at half‐height integration.

In spatial proteomics, matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging enables rapid and cost‐effective peptide measurements. Yet, in situ peptide identification remains challenging. Therefore, this study aims to integrate the trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS)–based parallel accumulation‐serial fragmentation (PASEF) into MALDI imaging of tryptic peptides to enable multiplexed MS/MS imaging.

An initial MALDI TIMS MS1 survey measurement was performed, followed by a manual generation of a precursor list containing mass over charge values and ion mobility windows. Inside the dual TIMS system, submitted precursors were trapped, separately eluted by their ion mobility and analyzed in a quadrupole time‐of‐flight device, thereby enabling multiplexed MALDI MS/MS imaging. Finally, precursors were identified by peptide to spectrum matching.

This study presents the first multiplexed MALDI TIMS MS/MS imaging (iprm‐PASEF) of tryptic peptides. Its applicability was showcased on two histomorphologically distinct tissue specimens in a four‐plex and five‐plex setup. Precursors were successfully identified by the search engine MASCOT in one single MALDI imaging experiment for each respective tissue. Peptide identifications were corroborated by liquid–chromatography tandem mass spectrometry experiments and fragment colocalization analyses.

In this study, we present a novel pipeline, based on iprm‐PASEF, that allows the multiplexed and spatial identification of tryptic peptides in MALDI imaging. Hence, it marks a first step towards the integration of MALDI imaging into the emerging field of spatial proteomics.

Matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging is a powerful method to probe the spatial distribution of biomolecules including metabolites, lipids, peptides, and proteins. In the field of spatial proteomics, MALDI imaging stands out by enabling the antibody‐independent, mass spectrometry‐based, rapid, cost‐effective, and spatial analysis of peptides and proteins [1,2,3,4,5]. Yet, in situ identification by mass spectrometry remains a major challenge in MALDI imaging as most measurements are limited to only MS1 spectra level, thus missing peptide fragment spectra (MS2), which are the backbone for peptide sequence information in mass spectrometry–based proteomics [6,7].

As a workaround for missing MS2 spectra, MALDI imaging workflows can resort to matching MALDI‐based MS1 masses to peptide identifications of additional liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC‐MS/MS) measurements or to direct in situ MALDI MS/MS measurements that are mostly performed spot‐wise [8,9,10,11]. When relying on LC‐MS/MS measurements, proteome coverage is significantly deeper than in MALDI imaging. This discrepancy typically results in multiple putative identifications for a single MALDI imaging feature. As any LC‐MS/MS precursor within an adequate mass accuracy window has to be considered correct, the probability of incorrect peptide identification and biological interpretation is increased, highlighting the need for defining specific matching thresholds [6,12,13].

Direct in situ identification of peptide ions in MALDI imaging, that is, by ion fragmentation, is considered optimal but is hampered by several hurdles [7,14,15]: First, the lack of chromatographic separation (as used for LC‐MS/MS) leads to the simultaneous detection of near‐isobaric peptides resulting in co‐fragmentation and chimeric MS2 spectra as well as limited enrichment of peptide ions. Second, most precursor selection methods for MALDI imaging typically filter for one precursor ion per set of laser shots, thus hindering multiplexing capabilities, limiting precursor selection windows and resulting in higher sample consumption and longer measurement times.

During recent years, quadrupole time‐of‐flight (Q‐TOF) tandem mass spectrometry has been enhanced by preceding trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) for both electrospray ionization (ESI) and MALDI systems. A dual TIMS cell system sorts and traps precursor ions based on their collisional cross section (CCS), thereby allowing separation of isobaric and isomeric peptides. The TIMS cell measures the closely related ion mobility (K) value. Within this study, we report the inverse reduced ion mobility (1/K0), which standardizes the ion mobility for temperature and pressure. TIMS‐based synchronization of ion storage and release with subsequent, quadrupole‐based ion selection and fragmentation steps leads to very efficient ion usage—a setup called parallel accumulation‐serial fragmentation (PASEF) [16]. This method has already significantly advanced ESI systems as used in LC‐MS/MS shotgun proteomics and was also applied to targeted proteomics as parallel reaction monitoring (prm)‐PASEF [17,18,19,20,21,22,23]. More recently, novel acquisition software enhancements have made the prm‐PASEF mode available to commercial MALDI imaging systems such as in the timsTOF fleX (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany), thereby enabling the multiplexed identification of peptide ions per set of laser shots. This software tool is called iprm‐PASEF (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany), and its applicability has already been demonstrated for lipids and metabolites [24,25].

The present study is the first to optimize and apply TIMS‐based acquisition modes including iprm‐PASEF to MALDI imaging of tryptic peptides for improving peptide identifications.

Mouse kidney tissues were obtained as surplus tissue from animals that had been sacrificed for unrelated experimental purposes in accordance with approved animal experimentation protocols. The mouse kidney samples represent leftover material that would have been discarded otherwise. Breast cancer tissue from murine patient‐derived xenografts (PDX tumor) were provided by Charles River Laboratories, Freiburg, Germany. The PDX experiments were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Society of Laboratory Animals (GV SOLAS). The PDX experiments were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the regional council (Permit Numbers: I19‐02). Bovine liver was obtained commercially from a local butcher. All tissues were formalin‐fixed and embedded in paraffin (FFPE) according to standard protocols [26]. FFPE blocks were sliced into 2‐μm‐thick sections and mounted onto IntelliSlides (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) or indium tin oxide (ITO) slide (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany).

For standard peptides and iprm‐PASEF validation, the synthetic peptide iRT kit was used (Biognosys AG, Schlieren, Switzerland). For LC‐ESI‐TIMS‐MS/MS optimization, Pierce HeLa Protein Digest Standard (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used. Further synthetic peptides were used for iprm‐PASEF validation: Apelin‐13 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), substance P (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and two further synthetic peptides (KLKESYCQRQGVPMN and KLKVIGQDSSEIHFKV) (GenScript, Piscataway Township, NJ, USA).

For all MALDI imaging measurements, two adjacent tissue slides were prepared simultaneously as described previously [27]. Deparaffinization was carried out in a series of xylol and ethanol/water dilutions as described previously [26]. Tissue sections were washed twice with 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate (AmBC) for 1 min. Antigen retrieval was performed in a citric acid monohydrate buffer with pH 6.0 in a steamer for 1 h at approximately 100°C. Slides were rinsed twice with 10 mM AmBC and dried for 10 min in a vacuum atmosphere at room temperature. Freshly prepared N‐tosyl‐L‐phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone treated trypsin (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ, USA) (0.1 mg/mL in 10% acetonitrile [ACN], 40 mM AmBC) was sprayed on the tissue slides using the M3+ sprayer (HTX Technologies, Chapel Hill, NC, USA) with the following parameters: temperature 30°C, nozzle velocity 750 mm/min, flow rate 30 μL/min, number of passes 8, track spacing 2 mm, pattern CC, drying time 0 s, and nitrogen gas pressure set to 10 psi. Afterwards, slides were incubated in a humidified chamber for 2 h at 50°C. Alpha‐cyano‐4‐hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (CHCA) (Sigma‐Aldrich, Munich, Germany) (10 mg/mL, 70% ACN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 7 mM ammonium phosphate) was applied using the M3+ sprayer with the following parameters: temperature 60°C, nozzle velocity 1350 mm/min, flow rate 100 μL/min, number of passes 8, track spacing 3 mm, pattern CC, drying time 10 s, and nitrogen gas pressure set to 10 psi. All samples within one experiment were stored for the same time and measured consecutively and within 24 h upon sample preparation. For validation purposes, two additional setups were carried out: First, for Section3.2, FFPE bovine liver slides were prepared for MALDI imaging measurement in triplicates as described above. The iRT kit peptides were spotted twice in a dilution series (400, 200, 100, and 50 fmol in 0.5 μL droplets) on top of the digested liver section before matrix application. Second, for Section3.3, 1 μL of a MasterMix containing iRT kit peptides, Apelin‐13, substance P, and synthetic peptides (KLKESYCQRQGVPMN and KLKVIGQDSSEIHFKV) were mixed with 1 μL CHCA matrix and spotted onto an empty ITO slide in triplicates to compare one‐plex and five‐plex iprm‐PASEF measurements. The MasterMix contained the following concentrations: iRT kit peptides (566.37 fmol/μL), Apelin‐13 (0.0088 μg/μL), substance P (0.0177 μg/μL), KLKESYCQRQGVPMN (0.221 μg/μL), and KLKVIGQDSSEIHFKV (0.044 μg/μL).

MALDI TIMS MS1 imaging datasets were acquired in the positive‐ion reflector mode using a timsTOF fleX mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) at a pixel size of 50 × 50 μm, using 600 shots and a laser frequency of 10 kHz. The instrument is equipped with a Nd:YAG laser emitting at 355 nm. Them/zrange was set tom/z800–2000, the 1/K0range to 1.2–2.1 V•s/cm2with a ramp time of 230 ms. Tuning parameters were optimized and set as follows: MALDI plate offset 80 V, deflection 1 delta 80 V, funnel 1 RF 250 Vpp, funnel 2 RF 500 Vpp, multiple RF 500 Vpp, collision energy 10 eV, collision RF 4000 Vpp, ion energy 5 eV, transfer time 185 ms, and pre pulse storage 20 μs. The TIMS cell pressure was decreased by adjusting the nitrogen flow until the calibration massm/z1221 (hexakis(1H, 1H, 4H‐hexafluorobutyloxy)phosphazine [Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA]), aligned to 170 V, yielding a TIMS cell pressure of 2.0 mbar. 1/K0andm/zcalibration was performed over ESI with the ESI‐low concentration tuning mix (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). For validation purposes, MALDI TIMS off MS1 imaging measurements were carried out with TIMS turned off, and all other parameters were kept identical.

For precursor selection, MALDI TIMS MS1 imaging data was analyzed with the software SCiLS Lab (Version 2024a Core, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The variance was kept to 10 ppm form/zand 0.01 V•s/cm2for 1/K0. Feature finding was carried out with T‐ReX3(TIMS) algorithm, root mean square (RMS) normalization, 2 × 2 spatial smoothing, 50% coverage, and 1% relative intensity threshold. In cases where feature selection was slightly off, the peak maximum was manually selected in the two‐dimensionalm/zand 1/K0plot. For the statistical analysis, the “Segmentation” tool in SCiLS Lab was used with RMS normalization, the region set to the tissue region, T‐ReX3(TIMS) feature list, denoising set to none, “Bisecting k‐Means” as method and “Correlation Distance” as metric. For the “Find Values Co‐Localized to Region” tool, RMS normalization was selected, ion images of the entire tissue region and the T‐ReX3(TIMS) feature list were submitted and correlated with one of the segmented regions of interest determined by the spatial segmentation tool. The co‐localization algorithm uses Pearson correlation analysis and only considers statistically significant correlations withp< 0.05.

To recover the co‐crystallized peptides after MALDI imaging acquisition, the matrix layer on the tissue slide was dissolved after MALDI measurement, collected with 70% ACN, and vacuum‐dried for ACN removal [12]. Peptides were cleaned up with PreOmics Cartridges (PreOmics, Planegg/Martinsried, Germany). The eluted peptides were vacuum‐dried and dissolved in water and 0.1% formic acid before loading on Evotips (Evosep, Odense, Denmark) for final desalting and LC‐ESI‐TIMS‐MS/MS measurement.

LC‐ESI‐TIMS‐MS/MS measurements of co‐crystallized peptides and 100 ng HeLa digest for method evaluation were conducted on a timsTOF fleX mass spectrometer equipped with a CaptiveSpray ion source (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). 10 fmol iRT Kit was spiked into all samples before Evotip loading. Chromatographic separation was performed with the Evosep One HPLC system (Evosep, Odense, Denmark) using the 30 samples per day method (44 min gradient, 500 nL/min) and the EV1137 performance 15‐cm reversed‐phase column (Evosep, Odense, Denmark) with buffer A consisting of 0.1% aqueous formic acid and buffer B of 0.1% formic acid in ACN. Samples were measured in positive data‐dependent acquisition (DDA)‐PASEF mode. To increase measurement of singly charged peptides, adjustment of the TIMS cell pressure and ion mobility calibration were performed as described in MALDI TIMS MS1 acquisition. The mass range was set tom/z100–1700 and 1/K0range to 0.7–2.1 V•s/cm2. Collision‐induced dissociation energy was set to 20–75 eV, ion accumulation time to 166 ms with a 100% duty cycle. The PASEF precursor polygon region was adjusted manually to include singly charged peptide traces. Tuning parameters were optimized and set as follows: deflection 1 delta 80 V, funnel 1 RF 250 Vpp, funnel 2 RF 500 Vpp, multiple RF 500 Vpp, collision energy 10 eV, collision RF 2500 Vpp, ion energy 5 eV, transfer time 70 ms, and pre pulse storage 15 μs. The capillary voltage was set to 1600 V and the drying gas flow rate was 3 L/min with 180°C drying temperature.

The FragPipe pipeline (v22.0) was employed for the analysis of the DDA‐PASEF datasets [28,29,30]. Peptide identification of MS2 spectra was obtained using MSFragger with raw (.d) files as input. Protein databases, either human (UP000005640, downloaded August 13, 2024) or mouse (UP000000589, downloaded June 10, 2024), were both compiled with common contaminants and internal standards (iRT Kit peptides). Reversed sequences were added as decoys. Default settings for label free quantification were applied with proline +15.999 (hydroxylation) set as a variable modification in MSFragger.

The iprm‐PASEF datasets were acquired using a prototype of the iprm‐PASEF tool for timsControl 5.1 provided by Bruker Daltonics GmbH, Bremen, Germany. Measurements were performed in MS/MS and positive ion reflector mode on the timsTOF fleX at a pixel size of 100 × 100 μm using 2000 shots and a laser frequency of 5 kHz. Them/zrange was set tom/z100–2000, and the 1/K0range was set to 1.2–2.1 V•s/cm2with a ramp time of 230 ms. Tuning parameters were optimized and set as follows: collision RF 750 Vpp, ion energy 5 eV, transfer time 55 ms, pre pulse storage 8 μs. Adjustment of the TIMS cell pressure and 1/K0calibration were performed as described in MALDI TIMS MS1 imaging acquisition. The iprm‐PASEF methods were set up with predefined 1/K0andm/zranges. Collision energies were adjusted depending on the precursor mass from 45 to 140 eV. For validation purposes, MALDI TIMS off MS/MS imaging measurements were performed with only TIMS turned off and all other parameters were kept identical.

In the DataAnalysis software (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany), MS2 spectra of each individual precursor were extracted over the mobilogram, averaged over all pixels, exported from the iprm‐PASEF datasets as individual “.mgf” files, and submitted to the “MASCOT MS/MS Ions Search” (Matrix Science, London, UK) against the Swiss‐Prot (2024/04) database including contaminants filtered by the respective taxonomy (Mus musculus,Homo sapiens) [31]. Enzymatic digestion was set to “Trypsin” with two missed cleavages allowed. The precursor tolerance was set to 100 ppm, fragment ion tolerances to 0.3 Da, and target FDR to 1%. Histidine, tryptophan, proline, and methionine oxidation as variable modification were included. MS2 spectra and assigned theoretical b‐ and y‐ions were visualized using the pyteomics package in python [32]. Theoretical b‐ and y‐ions were matched with a tolerance of 0.3 Da. Ion images of peptide fragments were plotted in SCiLS Lab. For co‐localization analysis of fragments, features were picked manually in the two‐dimensionalm/z and 1/K0plot in SCiLS Lab. The obtained feature list was then submitted to the “Find Values Co‐Localized to Feature” tool, normalization was set to RMS, and images of the tissue region were selected and the parent ion as feature to correlate. The co‐localization algorithm uses Pearson correlation analysis and only considers statistically significant correlations withp< 0.05. Finally, co‐localization scores were obtained to statistically estimate the spatial correlation of fragment to parent ion images.

Spatial proteomics using MALDI imaging benefits from the direct, in situ MS/MS‐based identification of peptide ions. PASEF‐enabled MALDI imaging supports this approach by ion mobility‐based precursor separation and entrapment according to distinct ion mobility features, thereby allowing multiplexing per set of laser shots. For measurement in iprm‐PASEF, precursor ions of interest are selected within predefined ranges of their relevant molecular properties, namely,m/zand 1/K0. The spatial proteomics pipeline performed in this study consists of four steps: (A) An initial MALDI TIMS MS1 survey measurement (50 × 50 μm), (B) manual assembly of a precursor list, (C) iprm‐PASEF‐based MALDI imaging for the creation of MS2 spectra of those precursors (100 × 100 μm), and (D) a peptide to spectrum matching (PSM) and potential corroboration. We used 50 μm resolution in the MS1 scan for refined spatial analysis, whereas iprm‐PASEF at 100 μm for identification focused on a faster acquisition and higher spectral quality.

The initial MALDI TIMS MS1 measurement (Figure1A) yields an overview of locally abundant MS1 precursor ions includingm/zand 1/K0values from which a feature list (typically 2000–8000 features) is derived. Multiplexed precursor ion trapping in the first TIMS chamber for iprm‐PASEF relies on nonoverlapping 1/K0windows. In addition, those windows need to be sufficiently wide to allow for efficient isolation. These requirements typically limit the number of precursor ions to 25 entries with distinct ion mobility windows. Therefore, a sophisticated precursor selection is necessary to perform the subsequent iprm‐PASEF survey.

(B) Precursor selection, for example, by an exploratory statistical analysis, is performed for a targeted MS/MS measurement. (C) With the selected precursors and their distinctm/zand 1/K0values, a multiplexed MALDI TIMS MS/MS imaging (iprm‐PASEF) scan is performed. The resulting MS2 spectra are identified using the MASCOT search engine. (D) Overview of the corroboration tools used in this study. Created in BioRender. Schilling, O. (2024);https://BioRender.com/g48n665.

As iprm‐PASEF is a targeted workflow, the precursor definition relies on manual selection (Figure1B). Notably, this selection highly depends on the experimental design and can be individually tailored to the aim of the study. For example, a statistical analysis of the MALDI TIMS MS1 dataset including a segmentation/classification and co‐localization can reveal features of histomorphological interest that subsequently can be chosen for further fragmentation. Eventually, a customized precursor list containingm/zvalues and 1/K0windows is obtained from the MALDI TIMS MS1 imaging dataset.

The iprm‐PASEF proof‐of‐concept measurement is performed at 100 × 100 μm spatial resolution, resulting in measurement times less than 100 min for 1 cm2area (2000 number of laser shots with 5 kHz frequency). In our preliminary experience, the reduction to 5 kHz enables prolonged accumulation times that benefit spectra intensity. The entire tissue section is scanned in iprm‐PASEF mode, resulting in spatially resolved information of fragment ions. For subsequent PSM of individual MS2 spectra, we resorted to the online version of the well‐established MASCOT software. For this purpose, ion mobility filtered MS2 spectra are averaged and exported to the “.mgf” format as implemented in the DataAnalysis software (Figure1C).

The presented pipeline further includes additional analyses to corroborate peptide identification by iprm‐PASEF (Figure1D): To complement the online MASCOT search output that is restricted to solely scores, mean MS2 spectra and correctly detected b‐ and y‐ions of the identified peptides are visualized with the pyteomics package. Ion images of fragments are examined to show similar spatial distribution as expected and statistically analyzed by the “Find Values Co‐Localized to Feature” tool in SCiLS Lab. With this tool, co‐localization of fragment to parent ions is evaluated based on Pearson correlation. We further aimed to support the iprm‐PASEF peptide identifications with PSM of LC‐ESI‐MS/MS (incl. TIMS) data. This step can be pursued with additional sample material or with matrix extracted peptides that have remained following initial MALDI imaging [12]. If the same peptide is identified by LC‐ESI‐TIMS‐MS/MS, precursorm/zand 1/K0values can be compared with MALDI imaging data to corroborate their identities.

As outlined, usage of TIMS for selection and entrapment of precursor ions is fundamental for iprm‐PASEF. We aimed to probe whether the dual TIMS step prior to Q‐TOF measurement impacts MS1 sensitivity as compared to a Q‐TOF measurement on its own. To this end, we adjusted TIMS parameters to accommodate for peptidic precursors: The ramp time was increased to 230 ms for sufficient separation and the TIMS cell nitrogen gas flow was lowered to 2.0 mbar to optimize accumulation.

To evaluate the effect of upstream dual TIMS usage on MS1 sensitivity, the iRT peptide kit was spotted in a dilution series on trypsin‐digested bovine liver tissue using default settings for MALDI MS1 imaging. Without dual TIMS (hence Q‐TOF on its own), the lowest detectable spot was at 50 fmol per peptide. Inclusion of the dual TIMS step for MALDI TIMS MS1 yielded a very comparable result (Figure2A). For all iRT ion images, see FigureS1. We conclude that inclusion of the dual TIMS step for MALDI MS1 does not significantly affect MS1 sensitivity.



Evaluation of TIMS‐supported MALDI MS1 and MS/MS imaging of tryptic peptides. (A) Synthetic tryptic peptides (iRT kit) were spotted on a bovine slice tissue section, CHCA‐matrix was applied, and MALDI MS1 imaging measurement was carried out either in TIMS on or TIMS off mode. The data were visualized and analyzed using the SCiLS Lab software. (B) Overview of the iprm‐PASEF methodology. After a MALDI TIMS MS1 imaging scan, specific precursors are selected for a MALDI TIMS MS/MS imaging (iprm‐PASEF) scan. MS2 spectra are analyzed using MASCOT (Created in BioRender. Schilling, O. (2024);https://BioRender.com/j85k835). (C) Comparison of the mobility/m/z heatmap between the default and optimized iprm‐PASEF method visualized in timsControl (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany).

iprm‐PASEF is an implementation of multiplexed MALDI TIMS MS/MS imaging to generate spatially resolved MS2 spectra (Figure2B). When establishing the TIMS‐enabled, multiplexed MS/MS data acquisition of tryptic peptides, we noticed the need to optimize the acquisition method to enable the detection of lowm/zfragment signals with additional sensitivity for high molecular weight precursor masses (Figure2C). Compared to the default peptide imaging method provided by Bruker Daltonics, we adjusted relevant tuning parameters as follows: “collision RF” from 4000 to 750 Vpp, “transfer time” from 185 to 55 ms and ‘Pre Pulse Storage’ from 20 to 8 μs. Them/zrange was set tom/z100–2000. Collision energies were increased dependent onm/zfrom 45 to 140 eV.

We further evaluated the impact of dual TIMS on MS2 spectra quality. Equally sized areas of tryptic digested bovine liver tissue slice were imaged in MS/MS mode in triplicates. Three precursors were selected for the MS/MS measurement (TableS1). Apart from TIMS turned on or off, all other parameters were kept identical. As independent measurements are required for every single precursor with TIMS turned off, the measurement area was tripled and measurements took longer compared to iprm‐PASEF. All MS2 spectra per precursor were averaged, exported in the “.mgf” format, and submitted to MASCOT for PSM. In iprm‐PASEF, all precursors were matched to peptide sequences with MASCOT scores higher than 35. Without the TIMS dimension, only one precursor was matched to a peptide sequence. However, for TIMS off methods, individual, precursor‐specific refinement of acquisition parameters may yet improve spectral quality and was not pursued in the present study. Overall, iprm‐PASEF allows for the simultaneous and multiplexed acquisition of MS2 spectra over a wide precursorm/zrange (Figure3).



Validation of the multiplexed MALDI MS/MS imaging using the novel iprm‐PASEF Software. Comparison between iprm‐PASEF (TIMS on) and MALDI TIMS off MS/MS imaging measurements. Three precursors (m/z944.5317,m/z1198.7029, andm/z1325.7512) are targeted in both modes on a prepared bovine liver tissue slice. In iprm‐PASEF, all three precursors can be measured simultaneously, whereas in MALDI MS/MS imaging in TIMS off mode, only one precursor can be targeted at a time. If possible, precursors were identified using MASCOT. Mass accuracies obtained by MASCOT are shown in ppm. Created in BioRender. Schilling, O. (2024);https://BioRender.com/j51r217, modified.

Next, we assessed whether multiplexing in iprm‐PASEF affects MS2 spectrum quality. A MasterMix of five synthetic peptides (see FigureS2for sequences) was mixed with CHCA matrix and spotted directly on an empty ITO slide (see Section2.2). Then, iprm‐PASEF measurements were performed; either using multiplexing of all five precursors or using 1‐plex, thereby individually aiming for one precursor after another. Visual inspection of the resulting MS2 spectra suggests highly similar MS2 spectra from both measurement approaches (Supplementary FigureS2). For further comparison of MS2 spectra quality, the completeness of the expected b‐ and y‐ion series was determined and can be found in the TableS2. Notably, the number of detected b‐ and y‐ions showed a maximum variance of two ions between measurements. We therefore conclude that multiplexing iprm‐PASEF measurements does not affect MS2 spectra quality.

LC‐ESI‐TIMS‐MS/MS‐based peptide identifications may serve to corroborate MALDI TIMS MS/MS‐based peptide identifications. However, MALDI ionization produces mostly singly charged ions in the typical mass range of tryptic peptide, whereas ESI usually yields tryptic peptide ions charged 1+ to 4+. For improved comparability of MALDI and ESI data, we sought to focus on singly charged ions in LC‐ESI‐TIMS‐MS/MS as 1/K0values are charge state dependent [33,34,35]. Therefore, we optimized the tuning parameters in LC‐ESI‐TIMS‐MS/MS measurements to increase the detection of singly charged peptides. An overview of an optimization experiment testing different settings can be found in TableS3. Key adjustments include setting the TIMS cell pressure similar to the MALDI imaging acquisition, increasing the upper 1/K0limit and redefining the PASEF polygon precursor region to include singly charged precursor ions.

Next, we assessed whether 1/K0values for the same peptide sequence are comparable between LC‐ESI‐TIMS‐MS/MS and MALDI TIMS MS1 imaging. To this end, iRT peptides (Biognosys AG, Schlieren, Switzerland) were measured using LC‐ESI‐TIMS‐MS/MS and MALDI TIMS MS1 imaging. Them/zand 1/K0values were highly comparable between those two measurements with anm/zvariance of lower than 5 ppm and a 1/K0variance of lower than 0.01 V•s/cm2(Table1).

To further elaborate the novel, MS/MS‐enabled, MALDI‐based spatial proteomics technique, two samples were selected as histomorphologically distinct tissue specimens. An FFPE mouse kidney sample was analyzed in a five‐plex setting and breast cancer tissue from murine patient‐derived xenografts (PDX tumor) was measured in a four‐plex setup, demonstrating the applicability of the workflow to different tissue species.

MS1 peptide imaging took 138 min generating 30 245 pixels (PDX tumor) and 107 min generating 22 977 pixels (mouse kidney) with a spatial resolution of 50 × 50 μm, resulting in a measurement speed of approximately 3.5 pixels per second, which is less than 200 min per cm2of tissue. Initial data assessment including feature finding, data visualization, and normalization was carried out in SCiLS Lab. Feature finding using T‐ReX3(TIMS) algorithm resulted in 6119 (mouse kidney) and 7536 (PDX tumor) features, respectively.

As mentioned above, precursor selection for iprm‐PASEF, a targeted method, is highly dependent on the experimental goal. This study focuses on method development and aims to provide a first proof of concept for spatial and multiplexed peptide identification. Therefore, we resorted to a basic exploratory statistical analysis of the MALDI TIMS MS1 imaging dataset. First, a “Bisecting k‐Means” segmentation was performed in SCiLS Lab with the T‐ReX3(TIMS) feature finding output to separate the two most distinct tissue subregions (Figure4A, red and green). These two subregions correspond to the extracellular space (green segment) and the cellular compartment (red segment), respectively. The tool “Find Values Co‐Localized to Region” in SCiLS Lab was then applied to all ion images of the T‐ReX3(TIMS) feature list, with the green subregion selected as region of interest. Thresholds of higher than 0.7 or lower than −0.7 were applied. Accordingly, scores higher than 0.7 indicate a strong co‐localization with the green subregion and scores lower than −0.7 with the red subregion, respectively. The results were further combined with a literature search in PubMed to obtain putative peptide identifications bym/zvalue. We included this potentially biased refinement step to increase confidence in the correctness of peptide identifications, as this study is the first to multiplex peptide fragmentation and serves as a proof of concept. Finally, the precursor selection for the PDX tumor includedm/z898.5029 andm/z1443.6980 with high co‐localization scores to extracellular space (0.74 and 0.76) andm/z944.5373 andm/z1325.7528 with low co‐localization scores (−0.71 and −0.77), meaning high correlation to cellular tissue region. For the mouse kidney, four features with high co‐localization scores to extracellular space were selected:m/z836.4425 with 0.79,m/z1105.5731 with 0.71,m/z1239.6418 with 0.71, andm/z1443.6943 with 0.75. As the lowest co‐localization score obtained for the mouse kidney was −0.55, no feature correlated with the cellular tissue region was selected in this case. Instead, featurem/z1198.7003 was selected due to its moderate correlation with the red subregion and its well‐documented identity in literature [8,36]. MS1 ion images of all selected precursors are shown in Figure4B, and an overview of the statistical analysis is given in TableS4.



Selection and multiplexed identification of precursors in one single iprm‐PASEF measurement. (A) Segmentation of MS1 datasets conducted in SCiLS Lab are shown resulting in two subregions. The red subregion corresponds to the cellular space and the green subregion to the extracellular space. (B) MS1 ion images of precursors selected from iprm‐PASEF. (C) MS2 spectra acquired in iprm‐PASEF mode with a spatial resolution of 100 μm are shown for one selected precursor of each test tissue. B‐ions are highlighted in red and y‐ions in blue. Ion images of respective fragments are shown on top of each spectrum.

For iprm‐PASEF of the mouse kidney, the set of five precursors chosen by exploratory statistical analysis was expanded with two randomly chosen, additional precursors due to 1/K0window availability (TableS5). The iprm‐PASEF measurement of the PDX tumor employed a set of four predefined precursors (TableS5).

The iprm‐PASEF measurements generated 5666 pixels in 47 min (mouse kidney) and 10 406 pixels in 81 min (PDX tumor) with a spatial resolution of 100x100 μm, resulting in a measurement speed of approximately 2 pixels per second which is less than 100 min per cm2of tissue. Mean MS2 spectra for each precursor were separated by their 1/K0traces and submitted to the search engine MASCOT, allowing for the assignment of peptide identities to the measured spectra. All precursors determined by MS1 statistical analysis were successfully identified by MASCOT (Table2and Figure4B). In contrast, the identity of the randomly selected precursors for the mouse kidney remained elusive. Mass accuracies were lower than 20 ppm for all precursors. The MASCOT score represents a statistical evaluation provided by Matrix Science; the higher the score, the more confidently a PSM can be considered [31]. The scores in this study ranged from 23.8 to 89.9 and were comparable with scores obtained in other published in situ MALDI MS/MS studies [37,38,39,40]. Presently, all acquired MS2 spectra per precursor over the entire tissue region are being averaged to yield a single MS2 spectrum, which we employed for the PSM step. We consider the possibility that quality filter steps prior to MS2 spectra averaging (e.g., signal‐to‐noise thresholds and subregion selection) may further improve final MS/MS data quality. However, this aspect was not further investigated in the present proof‐of‐concept study.

To corroborate the peptide identifications obtained by MASCOT, we performed a number of additional analyses (Figure1C).

Because the online MASCOT tool only provides an identification score, the pyteomics package was employed to examine theoretical b‐ and y‐ions of identified sequences as corroboration. All detected b‐ and y‐ions and the mean MS2 spectra can be found in the supplementary information (FigureS3and TableS6) and in Table2. For instance, all possible y‐ions and 50% of b‐ions for peptide GPAGPQGPR (m/z836.4425, mouse kidney) and all possible y‐ions and 9.1% of possible b‐ions of the respective peptide DNIQGITKPAIR (m/z1325.7528, PDX tumor) were detected. Additionally, fragment co‐localization was investigated in SCiLS Lab to include the acquired spatial distribution. The “Find Values Co‐Localized to Feature” tool was used with the tissue region and the parent ionm/zas the feature to correlate to. For demonstration purposes, the co‐localization analysis was only performed on one precursor for each tissue:m/z836.4425 for the mouse kidney andm/z1325.7528 for the PDX tumor. Co‐localization scores ranged from 0.50 to 0.90 (PDX tumor) and 0.40 to 0.56 (mouse kidney) (TableS7). Peptides with a C‐terminal arginine are usually well detected in MALDI‐TOF devices, explaining the high amount of identified y‐ions [41]. The MS2 spectra and ion images of the fragment signals, including the percentage of detected b‐ and y‐ions, are visualized for the two exemplary precursors in Figure4C. In addition, all precursor identifications are consistent with the expected histomorphological regions determined in the segmentation analysis, providing confidence at a biological level. For instance,m/z1325.7528, a peptide corresponding to the cellular protein histone 4, is found within in the red (cellular) subregion andm/z836.4425 a peptide corresponding to the extracellular matrix protein collagen 1A1 is found within the green (extracellular) subregion.

To demonstrate further corroboration by LC‐ESI‐TIMS‐MS/MS, we extracted the residual co‐crystallized peptides after the MALDI imaging measurement and submitted them to LC‐ESI‐TIMS‐MS/MS analysis [12]. By focusing on singly charged peptides, we detected seven out of nine precursors in 1+ charge, allowing for the comparison of 1/K0in addition to them/zvalue. One precursor (m/z1198.7003) was only detected on 2+ charge and one precursor atm/z836.4425 failed to be detected in LC‐ESI‐TIMS‐MS/MS. For the mouse kidney,m/zvariance was lower than 10 ppm and 1/K0variance lower than 0.04 V•s/cm2. For the PDX tumor, the variance form/zwas lower than 15 ppm and for 1/K0lower than 0.01 V•s/cm2(Table2).

Using these two test FFPE tissues, we demonstrated that iprm‐PASEF enables multiplexed in situ MS/MS, making it a valuable tool in the field of spatial proteomics.

In this study, we present the first performance of iprm‐PASEF on tryptic peptides as an initial step towards improving MALDI‐based spatial proteomics. This method enables us to tackle the issue of efficient spatial peptide identification as a key challenge in MALDI imaging of peptides. We demonstrate the ability to identify peptidic precursor ions on two different FFPE tissue samples in a spatially resolved manner using iprm‐PASEF. Peptide identification was corroborated using the MASCOT PSM search of MS2 spectra and additional LC‐ESI‐TIMS‐MS/MS measurements. For this proof of concept, we targeted frequently identified and highly abundant features that were only multiplexed up to five precursors. The ability to identify low abundant features remains to be investigated, as does the possible number of precursors identified per run. Nevertheless, identifying high abundant features remains relevant as they may also play crucial roles in biological contexts, such as collagens in the tumor microenvironment and cancer pathogenesis [42,43,44,45,46,47]. In addition, the identification of frequently reported features remains desirable in each individual experimental sample, as MS1 matching can yield multiple putative peptide identifications and vary between tissue specimens.

Notably, the presented technique is highly adaptable and can be customized to suit specific experimental needs. Several potential improvements could be tackled: First, MS1 imaging and iprm‐PASEF could be conducted on the same slide with a laser offset, reducing sample usage and simplifying co‐registration. Using a laser offset could also allow for multiple iprm‐PASEF runs with different precursor lists on the same slide, thereby increasing the number of targeted precursors. Second, the iprm‐PASEF data analysis pipeline presented in this study relies on four different software programs (DataAnalysis, SCiLS Lab, MASCOT, and Python/pyteomics), requiring multiple import and export steps. Manual adjustments were necessary due to, for example, limited performance of the SCiLS Lab feature detection tool for ion mobility data. This highlights potential for further optimization and automation of the data analysis workflow.

As a targeted method, iprm‐PASEF is restricted to a defined number of precursors and does not represent an exploratory approach. This targeted nature implements the precursor selection as a highly adjustable step in the presented pipeline that is dependent on prior information. However, it can be individually tailored to a scientific goal. Given that this study is a technical proof of concept, we focused on exploratory statistical analyses of the MALDI MS1 imaging data including segmentation and co‐localization for the precursor selection. Other approaches for manual precursor selection may include filtering the MS1 data for the most intense signals, literature‐based searches for specific peptides/proteins of interest, in silico digestion of specific proteins of interest, and generating LC‐ESI‐TIMS‐MS/MS‐based libraries from measurements of the same or comparable tissue sample. In contrast, Spatial Ion Mobility Scheduled Exhaustive Fragmentation (SIMSEF), a tool based on optimized and automated scheduling of MS/MS events, offers potential for nontargeted MS2 bioimaging [48]. However, its applicability is currently limited to metabolites and would require major technical adjustments to make it suitable for tryptic peptides. In addition, the SIMSEF tool would not provide spatial fragment ion information to confirm correct peptide identification at each pixel and would require major advances in data analysis.

Compared to other spatial proteomics methods, the presented workflow is not dependent on antibody availability, specificity or individual sample preparation establishment. This is the case in other multiplexed antibody‐based methodologies such as CODEX (Akoya), imaging mass cytometry, multiplex immunofluorescence/immunohistochemistry (IHC), or MALDI‐IHC [49,50,51,52]. Another powerful and upcoming method is MS‐based deep visual proteomics that exploits laser microdissection and provides a high spatial proteome coverage. However, compared to MALDI imaging, it is extremely laborious and requires a high amount of measurement and sample preparation time, making routine usage challenging [53,54].

Overall, by integrating TIMS and PASEF into MALDI imaging, we established a spatial proteomics workflow that enables multiplexed peptide identification and is low cost, fast, independent of antibodies and easy to combine with other analysis modalities. Altogether, this pipeline includes several tools for corroboration to increase confidence in peptide identification in MALDI imaging, making it highly valuable as a first MALDI‐based and straight forward approach in the field of spatial proteomics.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis. It is predominantly managed with pharmacological interventions, and physical impairments in people with gout have seldom been studied. We aimed to identify gout‐related physical impairments that may be targeted by physical interventions.

Five electronic databases (Medline, AMED, EMBASE, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL) were searched from inception to April 2024, together with reference lists of all included articles. We included all study designs, except for singular case reports, conducted in people with gout, where at least one objective physical impairment outcome was reported. All title, abstract and full‐text article eligibility screening was performed independently by two reviewers. Independent data extraction included design and setting, participant demographics, baseline characteristics, disease duration, physical impairment investigated, and method of assessment. Data synthesis was summarised descriptively.

Twenty‐four articles were included. Most studies were cross‐sectional designs in secondary care settings, 11 were performed in New Zealand. Participants' mean ages ranged from 41.3 (standard deviation (SD) not calculated) to 75.8 (SD 5.2) years. Participants were predominantly male. Gout duration ranged from 24 h to a mean of 28 years. Five broad categories of physical impairment were identified: lower extremity function, joint range of motion, strength, deformity, and Achilles tendon stiffness.

Based on limited evidence, the most commonly observed physical impairments are related to lower extremity function and joint range of motion. Our review identifies the need to better understand and quantify gout‐related physical impairments before developing targeted physical interventions.

Keywords:exercise, gout, physical activity, physical impairment, physical intervention

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis, affecting 3.2% of people in the UK in 2023 (Russell et al.2023). It develops when elevated serum urate levels (hyperuricaemia) lead to the formation and deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in and around joints. Crystal deposition leads to recurrent severely painful inflammatory flares, tophus formation, and chronic arthropathy.

Management of gout comprises pharmacological strategies, both anti‐inflammatory treatment for flares and long‐term urate‐lowering therapy (ULT) to lower serum urate levels, prevent new crystal formation and bring about dissolution of existing crystals (Hui et al.2017; Richette et al.2017; FitzGerald et al.2020; Neilson et al.2022). Non‐pharmacological management focusses solely on dietary modifications to support weight loss or reduce consumption of food or drinks that may contribute to hyperuricaemia or trigger flares, such as red meat or alcoholic beverages (Choi et al.2004a,2004b; Zhang et al.2012; Neogi et al.2014). The possibility that people with gout could benefit from physical interventions such as exercises or orthoses has received little attention but is plausible. Gout predominantly affects the lower limb, with almost all people with gout experiencing foot involvement (Roddy2011). Chronic gouty arthropathy is associated with chronic joint pain, tophi and joint damage and bone erosion (McCarthy et al.1991; Sapsford et al.2017). People with gout commonly have multiple comorbidities, including osteoarthritis (Roddy et al.2007,2008), which is associated with physical impairments such as muscle weakness (e.g. O'Reilly et al.1998; Øiestad et al.2022) and joint malalignment deformity (e.g. Sharma et al.2010), for which non‐pharmacological modalities are a core component of management (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence2022). However, there have been few studies on the extent to which people with gout have physical impairments that might be amenable to physical interventions. Small observational studies have reported muscle weakness, joint deformities, and reduced range of motion in people with gout (Stewart et al.2015,2016; Petty et al.2019). People with tophaceous gout participating in a qualitative study described gout causing restricted range of joint motion and deformity, activity limitation and participation restriction (Aati et al.2014). A small pilot study found that commercially available footwear reduced foot pain and disability in people with gout (Rome et al.2013).

We undertook a scoping review to identify gout‐related physical impairments that may be targeted by physical interventions delivered in healthcare settings.

Our review was undertaken in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodological guidance (Peters et al.2020), examining studies of people with gout (participants), who have physical impairments (concept) for which they could obtain treatment intervention in clinical healthcare settings (context). The design of our review is consistent with the Arksey and O'Malley framework, with the exception of the optional consultation exercise (Arksey and O'Malley2005). The review was undertaken and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews (Tricco et al.2018). Consistent with these guidelines, we did not appraise the quality of the included studies due to the range of methodological designs adopted.

We included all study designs across all care settings, with the exception of singular case reports, conducted in people with a gout diagnosis that included at least one objective physical impairment outcome. We excluded studies reporting only self‐reported physical impairment data, non‐human studies, editorials, review articles, and letters. There were no language restrictions.

Five databases were searched using two database interfaces from inception to 11thApril 2024. Medline, AMED and EMBASE were searched using Ovid. APA PsycInfo and CINAHL Plus with Full Text were searched using EBSCO. A faculty research fellow assisted in refining the search strategy and helped develop keywords and optimise fields. The integrity of the strategy was verified by identifying the inclusion of a known study that met all the eligibility criteria. The full search strategy can be found in the Supporting InformationS1. In addition, we screened the reference lists of all included studies for further eligible studies.

Retrieved articles from the five searched databases were exported into the Rayyan reference management software package (Ouzzani et al.2016). Duplicates from across databases were removed by PK. Title, abstract and full‐text article eligibility screening was performed independently by PK and JB, with discrepancies resolved by ER and/or MJT.

Data extraction was standardised using a data collection form and independently undertaken by two reviewers (PK and JB), with checking and arbitration performed by ER and/or MJT. Data extraction included design and setting, participant demographics, baseline characteristics, disease duration, physical impairment investigated, and method of impairment assessment. Where possible, comparative information about non‐gout and gout populations, or information about gout only populations, was extracted. The included studies were summarised descriptively and all extracted information from the data collection form was tabulated.

In total, 3412 unique citations were identified from the database search (Figure1). After duplicates were removed, 2187 titles and abstracts were screened, with 188 full‐text articles being assessed. Of these, 164 articles were excluded after full‐text review for the following reasons: incorrect study design, 88; no physical impairment outcomes, 70; incorrect publication type (single case reports, editorials, review articles, and letters), 5; and mixed sample of conditions without disaggregated gout data, 1. This resulted in 23 studies eligible for inclusion. One additional article was identified following screening of the reference lists of the included studies, resulting in 24 included studies.



Study flow chart (adapted from Page et al.2021).

Of the 24 included studies, 20 were undertaken in secondary care and one in primary care, two were community/population‐based studies, and for one study the setting was unclear (Table1). All studies were published between 1991 and 2023. One study was translated from Chinese (Feng and Xiong2021). Most studies were cross‐sectional (n= 17), followed by cohort studies (n= 5, one retrospective), then singular randomised controlled trial (n= 1) and case‐series designs (n= 1). Studies originated from eight countries, most commonly New Zealand (n= 11), followed by China (n= 3), United States (n= 3), Taiwan (n= 2), United Kingdom (n= 2), France (n= 1), Malaysia (n= 1), and Mexico (n= 1). The combined sample size of the included articles was 10,107, and the majority of study participants were male (range 60%–100%). Five study samples were exclusively male. Across the included studies, where reported, mean age ranged from 41.3 (standard deviation (SD) not calculated) to 75.8 (SD 5.2) years and gout duration from 24 h to a mean of 28 years. Overall study sample sizes ranged from 7 to 5819 participants. Studies examined physical impairments in the following areas of the body: foot/ankle (n= 7), hand/wrist (n= 4), knee (n= 3), lower extremity (n= 2) and multiple joints (n= 5). Joint location was unclear for three studies.

Using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) (Guralnik et al.1994), lower limb function (Kolmogorov‐Smirnovp< 0.001) and unadjusted walking speed (p< 0.001) were worse in people with gout (n= 595) compared to people without gout (n= 5224) (Burke et al.2015).

Several studies undertaken in New Zealand have investigated gait in a number of ways. In a cross‐sectional study of 20 people with gout and 20 controls, spatiotemporal parameters during walking at participant‐selected speed observed greater step time (p= 0.017) and stance time (p= 0.012), but lower velocity (p= 0.031) and cadence (p= 0.013) in people with gout than controls. At a faster walking speed, the parameter patterns remained comparable, with the addition of greater swing time among people with gout (p= 0.005) (Stewart, Morpeth, et al.2016). When comparing spatiotemporal parameters and plantar pressure whilst walking barefoot (24 people with gout, 34 age/sex matched controls), step time and stance time were both higher in people with gout (p= 0.022,p= 0.022, respectively) and velocity was lower (p= 0.050). Gout participants also demonstrated lower peak pressures in some foot regions (heel,p= 0.012; hallux,p= 0.036) and higher pressure in the midfoot (p< 0.001), with higher midfoot pressure time integrals (p= 0.005) (Stewart, Dalbeth, et al.2016). In cross‐sectional first metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ)‐focused analyses, people with gout had lower plantar flexion force (p= 0.012) (n= 24 with gout,n= 34 age/sex matched controls) (Stewart et al.2015) and walking velocity (p= 0.001) among people with ultrasound‐identified tophus (n= 23 with gout,n= 34 age/sex matched controls) (Stewart, Dalbeth, Vandal, et al.2017). Plantar pressure variations among 36 people with gout have also been reported when observing walking in shoes of varying quality (Stewart et al.2014). In 25 people with chronic gout and 25 age/sex matched controls, people with chronic gout had lower hallux peak plantar pressures (p< 0.05) lower hallux pressure time integrals (p< 0.05), higher midfoot pressure time integrals (p< 0.05), slower walking pace and longer step and stride lengths (Rome et al.2011).

Similarly, Carroll et al. (2018) compared a range of ankle‐specific kinematic and kinetic parameters in 24 people with gout and 24 controls, but found no difference in gait patterns between groups, except for peak ankle joint angular velocity, which was lower in people with gout (p< 0.01) (Carroll et al.2018).

A cross‐sectional case‐control comparison (gout,n= 24; controls,n= 34) observed significantly lower 1stMTPJ range of motion among people with gout (p< 0.001) (Stewart et al.2015). A further analysis in the same cohort comparing 46 gout joints with 68 control joints observed the same trend towards lower 1stMTPJ range of motion among people with gout, but this did not reach statistical significance (Stewart, Dalbeth, Vandal, et al.2017).

A separate, more recent, cross‐sectional study (gout,n= 26; controls,n= 102) also reported lower 1stMTPJ range of motion among people with gout (p= 0.035), as well as a smaller range of subtalar joint inversion (p< 0.001) and eversion (p= 0.010) (Petty et al.2019). Lu et al. (2020) demonstrated that range of motion deficits in the knee of 26 gout participants responded well to ULT over an average of 18.2 months (p< 0.001), however full range of motion was not restored (mean 129.6, SD 6.5, following ULT). A small randomised controlled trial comparing arthroscopic debridement and oral medication with oral medication only for gout knee arthritis (n= 60) showed that trial participants had knee flexion and extension deficits (Wang et al.2015). In a case series of seven people with gout, knee flexion deficits were observed in all participants and extension deficits were present in three participants (Yu et al.2004). In a retrospective cohort study of gout wrist arthritis (n= 24), statistically significant improvements in wrist joint range of motion deficits were observed following both conservative and surgical treatment interventions (Feng and Xiong2021). López López et al. (2017) also observed limited joint motion in people with gout (n= 564) but the number of joints involved and extent of restriction were unclear.

In a cross‐sectional study of foot and ankle strength (n= 20 with gout,n= 20 matched controls), people with gout had lower plantar flexion, inversion and eversion strength (p< 0.05), and plantar flexion/dorsiflexion strength ratio (p< 0.05) (Stewart, Mawston, et al.2016). In the same cohort comparing people with foot or ankle tophi (n= 22) with those without (n= 35), lower plantar flexion (p< 0.001), dorsiflexion (p= 0.003), inversion (p= 0.003) and eversion (p= 0.001) was observed in people with foot or ankle tophi (Stewart, Dalbeth, Otter, et al.2017). The presence of Achilles tophi also resulted in lower plantar flexion (p< 0.001), inversion (p= 0.008) and eversion (p= 0.001) muscle force (Stewart, Dalbeth, Otter, et al.2017).

Grip strength was considered by two studies. Burke et al. (2015) (n= 595 with gout,n= 5224 without gout) observed no difference between grip strength and gout after stratification by sex (females,p= 0.08; males,p= 0.61). A more recent study by Nehme et al. (2023) (n= 201 with gout,n= 2328 without gout) observed no association between grip strength and gout (p= 0.774) but found a positive association between serum urate and grip strength in people without gout (p= 0.028). One study (n= 20) found that chronic tophaceous gout was associated with poor hand function (Dalbeth et al.2007).

In a sample of 55 people with gout who underwent surgery for finger deformity and impaired function, the majority experienced improvement following the procedure; however, the nature of improvement was unclear (Yang et al.2021).

In a cross‐sectional study (n= 56 with gout,n= 41 controls), people with gout were more likely to have hallux valgus (p= 0.0007) (Blandin et al.2018). Compared to age/sex matched controls (n= 34), people with gout (n= 24), in a study by Stewart et al. (2015), were more likely to have severe hallux valgus (odds ratio 0.284, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.085, 0.947,p= 0.041). A cross‐sectional study by Petty et al. (2019) observed a higher frequency of mallet toe in the left foot of people with gout (n= 26), compared to people without gout (n= 102) (p< 0.001), but not in the right foot. In an earlier study by McCarthy et al. (1991), radiographic progression was observed in nine out of 39 people with gout over 10‐year follow up, seven of whom had progressive deformity evident on clinical assessment. The description of the specific joints involved was unclear. Similarly, in a sample of 138 people with gout, the presence of joint deformity was common (39%), but details of their nature were unspecified (Teh et al.2013). In a sample of 20 people experiencing an acute gout flare (n= 18 at follow‐up), Rome et al. (2012) observed ‘moderate’ changes in structure at the forefoot and rearfoot, and a pronated foot profile in most participants, all of which showed no significant difference between baseline and 6–8‐week follow‐up when the flare had resolved. Petty et al. (2019) observed no difference in foot posture between gout and non‐gout participants (p= 0.791).

One study examined Achilles tendon stiffness using ultrasound imaging with shear wave elastography. Compared with age/sex‐matched controls (n= 26), people with gout (n= 24) had significantly lower Achilles tendon stiffness (right Achilles mean difference 1.04 m/s (95%CI 0.38, 1.7),p= 0.003; left Achilles mean difference 0.7 m/s (95%CI 0.09, 1.32),p= 0.025) (Otter et al.2020).

We identified 24 studies describing physical impairments in people with gout. These impairments comprised lower extremity function, joint range of motion, strength, deformity and Achilles tendon stiffness. Since this was a scoping review, we did not assess methodological quality; however, most studies were small and cross‐sectional in nature. Given the predilection of gout for the foot, not surprisingly, most studies assessed impairments in the foot/ankle. Compared with people who do not have gout, we found evidence that people with gout have worse lower extremity function, walk more slowly with longer step and stance times, have lower peak plantar pressures in the hallux and heel and higher plantar pressure and pressure‐time integrals in the midfoot, have reduced range of motion at the 1stMTPJ and subtalar joint, more commonly have hallux valgus, and have less stiff Achilles tendons. They have lower muscle strength in the foot, but two studies found no association between grip strength and gout. Some contrasting or inconsistent observations across included studies may be explained by small sample sizes or differences in objective measurement, for example, different approaches to measurement of lower extremity gait function via gait analysis. In some studies, the method of impairment assessment and outcomes were unclear, indicating variation in study quality.

To our knowledge, this is the first review of physical impairments in people with gout. Limitations of our review methods include not registering our protocol publicly prospectively and not searching grey literature although this is not uncommon for scoping reviews of this nature. As with any systematic or scoping review, our findings are limited by the extent and quality of the published literature. Of the included studies, most were limited by small sample sizes and cross‐sectional design. However, our primary aim was to identify which gout‐related physical impairments have been studied in the existing literature rather than to draw inferences about them. Although we included 24 publications, the study populations of some studies overlapped, and hence further research and new datasets appear warranted.

An important consideration is which people with gout these impairments affect most. Gout clinical phenotypes are broad and include recurrent gout flares, intercritical gout, chronic gouty arthritis, and tophaceous disease (Bursill et al.2019). It seems likely that people with the most frequent flares, chronic gouty arthritis, or tophi will be most at risk of physical impairments. However, most included studies did not include a specific phenotype or did not specify the phenotype included. Three out of 24 studies recruited only people with tophaceous gout. A cross‐sectional study from New Zealand found that foot and ankle tophi were associated with lower muscle force in the foot and ankle (Stewart, Dalbeth, Otter, et al.2017). Comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and osteoarthritis are prevalent in people with gout (Roddy et al.2007,2008; Bevis et al.2018) and can lead to physical impairment and frailty (e.g. Sokhal et al.2023). However, no studies have considered the impact of comorbidity on physical impairment in people with gout.

Our findings highlight common impairments that could be targeted by physical interventions. Such interventions commonly form part of the management of a variety of other musculoskeletal conditions. In broad terms, lower extremity function, spatiotemporal gait parameters, and their potential modification through rehabilitation are clinically plausible (Charlton et al.2021). As with all musculoskeletal conditions, restoring and optimising deficits in joint range of motion can improve overall movement and function.

Exercise programmes targeting functional limitation and muscle weakness show effectiveness for osteoarthritis (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence2022) and other arthropathies (e.g. Alghadir et al.2019; Azeez et al.2020; Boudjani et al.2023; Silva et al.2023). There have been few studies of exercise interventions for hallux valgus (Hurn et al.2022). However, a progressive resistance exercise programme has been shown to increase toe flexor strength in older people (Mickle et al.2016). Toe flexor strength is frequently reduced in people with hallux valgus deformity and is hence, a plausible treatment target (Hurn et al.2015). A recent pilot and feasibility trial found that a multifaceted, nonsurgical intervention including foot exercises met its predetermined efficacy threshold for improvements in strength of hallux plantar flexion as well as ankle dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, inversion and eversion but not lesser toe plantar flexion, despite adherence to the intervention being impacted by the COVID‐19 pandemic and stay‐at‐home (lockdown) orders (Menz et al.2023).

A general reduction in Achilles tendon stiffness can occur as a normal part of the ageing process and resistance training has been shown to improve Achilles tendon stiffness in older people (McCrum et al.2018). In addition to targeted exercise‐based physical interventions, it is plausible that gout‐related physical impairments may also respond positively to foot orthoses interventions (Herchenröder et al.2021; Hurn et al.2022).

We found that existing studies have investigated lower extremity function, joint range of motion, strength, deformity and Achilles tendon stiffness in people with gout, showing that physical impairments appear to be prevalent in people with gout and more common than in those without gout. Our findings suggest that this is a topic worthy of future study and that further research is needed to identify which physical impairments are most relevant to people with gout, investigate their burden in people with gout, and develop novel interventions to target them, including physical interventions such as therapeutic exercise and orthoses.

H6PD modulates essential physiological processes, including energy and redox metabolism. Its sole reported interacting partner is 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11β-HSD1), utilizing NADPH to reactivate glucocorticoids, linking energy status with hormonal response. Previous studies showed that loss of H6PD affects breast cancer cell properties, independent of 11β-HSD1. It remains unknown whether this is due to impaired concentrations of NADPH or PPP products downstream of H6PD. To gain insight into novel roles and pathways influenced by this enzyme, we aimed to assess the H6PD interactome.<h4>Results</h4>We adapted the proximity-dependent Biotin Identification (BioID) method to identify novel H6PD interacting partners. First, we validated the method and confirmed the known interaction between H6PD and 11β-HSD1. Next, we constructed a triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell clone stably expressing a H6PD-biotin ligase fusion protein. Enriched biotinylated proteins were analyzed by mass-spectrometry and potential candidates assessed further by co-immunoprecipitation and functional assays. The resulting interactome revealed proteins of the calreticulin/calnexin cycle, unfolded-protein response (UPR) and chaperone activation pathways. Due to its known association with breast cancer, we examined the PDI Anterior gradient protein 2 (AGR2) as H6PD interacting partner. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed multiple overlapping pathways enriched in breast cancer tissues with relatively high H6PD and AGR2 expression. These included glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism, hypoxia, angiogenesis and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) from MCF7 cells confirmed a physical interaction between H6PD and AGR2. ARG2 knockdown in these cells increased H6PD protein levels but decreased activity. Coexpression with AGR2 in HEK-293 cells did not affect expression but enhanced H6PD activity.<h4>Conclusion</h4>BioID was successfully applied in the endoplasmic reticulum to identify AGR2 as H6PD interactor. This was confirmed using Co-IP from MCF7 cells endogenously expressing both proteins. The results indicate that AGR2 controls H6PD protein expression and enhances its activity. Whether higher H6PD activity due to increased AGR2 expression promotes a more aggressive cancer cell phenotype, for example by altering energy metabolism, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-related processes or UPR and chaperone activation pathways, warrants further investigations.","Division of Molecular and Systems Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Basel, Klingelbergstrasse 50, 4056, Basel, Switzerland.",epublish,eng,Electronic,"{'pubType': ['research-article', 'Journal Article']}",,"{'keyword': ['Endoplasmic reticulum', 'Breast cancer', 'Protein–protein Interaction', 'Hexose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase', 'Proximity Biotinylation', 'Anterior Gradient Protein 2']}",,"{'fullTextUrl': [{'availability': 'Subscription required', 'availabilityCode': 'S', 'documentStyle': 'doi', 'site': 'DOI', 'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1186/s13578-025-01388-9'}, {'availability': 'Open access', 'availabilityCode': 'OA', 'documentStyle': 'html', 'site': 'Europe_PMC', 'url': 'https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12032772'}, {'availability': 'Open access', 'availabilityCode': 'OA', 'documentStyle': 'pdf', 'site': 'Europe_PMC', 'url': 'https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12032772?pdf=render'}]}",Y,Y,Y,Y,N,Y,0,Y,Y,Y,N,Y,cc by,N,N,N,N,Y,,2025-04-25,2025-04-27,2025-04-28,2025-04-28,2025-04-25,"A BioID-based approach uncovers the interactome of hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in breast cancer cells and identifies anterior gradient protein 2 as an interacting partner.

The results revealed that there is a marked enhancement in residents' knowledge about research misconduct, their perception of its consequences, and their overall disapproval of such behavior in the CBL group.

Coccidiosis is an important parasitic disease of broiler chickens. Drug resistance to the polyether polyether Ionophore anticoccidial drugs  (PACDs) caused by long‐term use has emerged as a significant problem in commercial broiler chicken production.

This study explored the feasibility of 1,8‐cineole (CIN) in replacing PACD with broiler feeding experiments and intestinal microecological experiments.

This experiment selected 21‐day‐old Lingnan yellow (LNY) broilers and randomly divided them into 8 groups, with 30 chickens in each group. They were uniformly fed with full feed during the breeding period. The experimental groups were as follows: (i) three broiler groups that were fed a PACD supplementation (G1: Salinomycin Premix [SAP] 60 mg/kg; G2: Monensin Premix [MOP] 100 mg/kg and G3: Maduramicin Premix [MAP] 5 mg/kg), (ii) three broiler groups that were administered different CIN dosages (G4: CIN‐L 100 mg/kg, G5: CIN‐M 150 mg/kg and G6: CIN‐H 250 mg/kg) and (iii) two control broiler groups (G7: infected control group and G8: healthy control group). On the 23rd day, all groups were infected with coccidian cysts, except the G8 group which was used as a blank control. After 2 weeks of continuous feeding, the growth performance changes of broilers were analysed, and the intestinal lesions of eight groups of broilers were analysed after slaughter.

Compared with PACD treatment, the average daily feed intake (ADFI) of the three CIN‐treated groups increased by 13%, whereas the feed conversion ratio (FCR) reduced by 28%. FCR value for the high‐dose CIN treatment was 2.04, 34% decline which compared with control group infected with spore oocysts. The anticoccidial index (ACI) of all PACD treatments was less than 120, whereas the ACI of the middle‐ and high‐dose CIN treatments was higher than 180. In comparison to theEimeria‐infected control group, the diversity and total number of the microbiota in the CIN treatments increased significantly. Moreover, CIN treatment favoured the proliferation of intestinal probiotics, especiallyLactobacillussp.

CIN could have an inhibitory effect on parasite development as suggested in the gene function annotation of the intestinal microbiota. These results demonstrate that CIN may be a feasible natural alternative to anticoccidiosis drugs. So it was important to take precautions against and control coccidiosis in poultry production which has a lesser risk of creating resistance to substitutive PACDs.

Coccidiosis is entirely common and serious parasitic disease in broilers. Poultry coccidiosis caused byEimeriaparasites results in considerable financial losses for the livestock industry (Taha et al.2021). Coccidiosis can be caused by a variety of coccidia of the genusEimeriaparasitizing the small intestine or the cecal mucosa of broilers, where it multiplies and induces intestinal tissue damage and haemorrhage by being parasitic on cecal mucosal epithelial cells (Balacs1997).Eimeria tenellacauses cecal coccidia, has a strong pathogenic effect and mainly affects chicks between 3‐ and 5‐week‐old. Coccidia that damage the small intestinal mucosa (viz., the small intestinal coccidia) are also caused byEimeria. In fact, there are seven species of coccidia that readily infect broilers.Eimeria tenella,Eimeria necatrix,Eimeria brunetti,Eimeria maxima,Eimeria acerulinaandEimeria mitisare the six main species that suffer significant economic losses from coccidiosis in animal husbandry (Williams2002). The six main species behind significant financial losses (Lan et al.2017). In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the frequency of clinical outbreaks of intestinal coccidiosis in broilers, resulting in significant losses to the poultry industry.

In order to improve the inhibition and restrain chicken coccidiosis, which seriously endangers the development of the chicken industry, it is necessary to select highly effective and sensitive anticoccidiosis drugs (Allen and Fetterer2002). Most drugs have been used for some time, resulting in many different developments of resistance and susceptiveness loss (Kraieski et al.2021). However, due to the widespread misuse of anticoccidial drugs in clinics, these drugs not only fail to effectively control coccidiosis but also increase feeding costs and contribute to the development of drug and cross‐resistance, thereby also resulting in a large number of drug‐resistant strains emerging (Chapman1997).

Polyether anticoccidial drugs (PACDs) have been available for several years. Currently, salinomycin, monensin and maduramycin are widely used in the market. These drugs are often used as anticoccidial additives in broiler diets and inevitably interact with other drugs. At the same time, due to their narrow safety range, careless dosing could cause poisoning. As treatment time increases, PACDs lose their initial sensitivity. PACDs are similar in chemical structure and modus operandi; as a result, strains resistant to one of these drugs may also be resistant to other PACDs. However, among the currently used anticoccidial drugs, the antibiotic resistance rate of PACDs is slower than that of chlorphenidine, sulpha drugs, changshanone, aminoproline or nicarbazine; all of which are commonly used anticoccidial drugs (Idris et al.2023).

Eucalyptus leaves contain a large number of active ingredients. Among them, 1,8‐cineole (CIN) is the basis ingredient (Wildy et al.2000). CIN (C10H18O) has a molecular weight of 154.25, containing cyclic ether and alcohol functional groups, soluble in ether, chloroform, propylene glycol and other organic solvents and slightly soluble in water. Therefore, it has good fat solubility and penetrability to cell membrane (Merghni et al.2023).

Recent studies have examined CIN for some biological and pharmacological properties, consisting of its disinsection characteristic (Thâmarah et al.2021), mucolytic, anti‐microbial (Ralph et al.2023), anti‐ageing, antineoplastic (Moteki et al.2002), reducing inflammatory responses of gastric ulcer (Germana et al.2015) and improving cardiac function (Wang et al.2024).

In view of the nature and potential medical treatment prospects of CIN, we hypothesized that CIN has an effect on the control and prevention of coccidiosis in broilers. In this study, we infected young broilers with four common coccidiosis cysts and then fed different dosages of CIN supplemented feed for feeding to observe the control effect of CIN on coccidiosis in young broilers. The effect of CIN and PACDs on controlling coccidiosis in young broilers was compared. The mechanism of CIN controlling coccidiosis in young broilers was discussed. The study might provide the basis for exploring the use of plant extracts to control parasitic diseases in broiler chickens.

The strains used in this study wereE. tenellaETWH,E. necatrixENYS,Eimeria acervulinaEAWY andE. maximaEMHL. All these strains were isolated and preserved in the Parasitic Biology Laboratory of Institute of Animal Science. The used PACDs (including Salinomycin Premix [SAP], Monensin Premix [MOP] and Maduramicin Premix [MAP]) were purchased from Company. Although 1‐day‐old Lingnan yellow (LNY) broilers were fed. The complete formula broiler feed (without any anticoccidial or antibacterial drugs) was specially produced by ourselves (TablesS1andS2). All animal trials have been approved by the IACUC.

The experimental cage in this study is made of stainless steel with a size of 180 × 80 × 45 cm3. The feeder is made of polyethylene plastic and with a size of 530 × 350 mm2. The drinker is a nipple drinker, the length of the nipple is 20 mm, and the water pressure is 0.1–0.3 MPa.

CIN (content ≥90%) was purchased from France. Because CIN is insoluble in water, it is difficult to be absorbed by direct feeding of broilers. Before feeding, it is made into an emulsion with twice the volume of Tween 80. Specifically, Tween 80 is added to the right amount of distilled water and stirred at 500 rpm to disperse it evenly in the water, forming a clear or translucent solution. Then, the CIN drops were slowly added to the above Tween 80 solution, and 30 mn was stirred at 800 rpm during the drip process to make CIN fully and evenly mixed with Tween 80 solution to obtain a stable CIN emulsion. CIN emulsion was slowly added to the drinking water system through the dosing device, and the experimental broilers drank freely and monitored to make it reach the designed drinking amount.

Our experiment design was conducted refer to minor modifications (Mathis et al.2021). The broilers were raised to the age of 21‐day (180–190 g) and were individually weighed. The broilers were divided randomly into 8 groups with 30 each group, and the experimental forms were as follows (TableS3): (i) three broiler groups that were fed with PACDs supplement (G1: SAP 60 mg/kg; G2: MOP 100 mg/kg and G3: MAP 5 mg/kg), (ii) three broiler groups that were administered different CIN dosages (G4: CIN‐L 100 mg/kg, G5: CIN‐M 150 mg/kg and G6: CIN‐H 250 mg/kg) and (iii) two control broiler groups (G7: infected group and G8: healthy group). All groups were oral administration of inoculation with 1.5 × 105sporulated oocysts, except the G8 group. Broilers were fed CIN and PACDs containing feed, infected with spore oocysts 2 days later and continued to be fed the above feed and observed for 12 days. The defecation and faecal status of broilers were observed daily. The weight of broilers were record. During this time, the experiment broilers were fed two to three times a day and fed freely. This study was carried out in July in Guangdong Province, China.

Generally, the date of weight gain rate (WGR), average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), feed conversion ratio (FCR), relative weight gain rate (RGR) and survival rate (SR) were calculated as follows (Stephan et al.1997):

As indicated by Suo's method (Suo et al.1994), the blood stool scoring mode was applied at 120 h after the onset of the infection, and the proportion of blood in the stool was observed, photographed and recorded. The blood in the stool was scored 12–24 h after the infection with theEimeriastrains, according to the following criteria: ‘0’ means that the stool is blood‐free; ‘1’ means that 25% are bloody stools; analogously, ‘2’ means 50%, ‘3’ means 75% and ‘4’ means 100%.

On the 7th day after the infection, the broilers were slaughtered. According to the lesion scoring mode designed by Barwick et al. (1970), the intestinal lesions of each broiler were scored, and the lesion scores were converted into lesion values recorded as 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4. In the employed lesion score, when condition of the cecal lesions is different between two sides, the more seriously damaged side prevails.

The grading was as follows: ‘0’ indicates no obvious lesions and is healthy, ‘1’ indicates the existence of few scattered petechiae on the cecum wall, the intestinal wall not being thickened and the contents being normal; ‘2’ indicates the number of lesions being large, the contents of the cecum being obviously bloody, the wall of the cecum has a bit thickened, and the contents were unremarkable; ‘3’ indicates a lot of blood in the cecum or inner the a cecal core (blood condenses into pieces or off‐white, cheese‐like and banana‐like‐shaped mass), the cecal wall being hyper‐trophic and the amount of faeces in the cecum being low; ‘4’ indicates the cecum swelling due to a large amount of blood or intestinal core and the intestinal core containing or not containing faecal residue. Broilers that died due to coccidiosis were also calculated as ‘4’.

The lesion value was calculated according to the following equation:

The faeces of 108 h after the infection were collected, stirred evenly and weighed. Three samples were taken from each group. The faecal oocysts were counted according to the McMaster's counting method, and the number of faecal oocysts per gram (OPG), as well as the oocyst value in each group, were calculated (TableS4) (McDougald et al.1987).

According to the calculation formula (Chapman1998), the ACI was calculated as described in the following equation:

he drug‐sensitive efficacy standard of ACI is that ACI < 160 is judged as positive (+), ACI ≥ 160 judged as negative (−) with low degree of drug resistance, 160 ≤ ACI < 180 indicated moderate drug resistance, ACI ≥ 180 indicated high drug resistance.

Different intestinal content was collected as samples to study the microbial flora of broilers. The contents of the intestines (duodenum and cecum) were collected from four broilers of each group randomly. All the samples were preserved in sterile tube and stored immediately at −80°C. Finally, 30 ng of the qualified genomic DNA samples were taken out. The V3–V4 area was amplified by PCR (forward primer: 5′‐ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG‐3′; reverse primer: 5′‐GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT‐3′). To facilitate the detection of fragment range and library concentration, an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer was used. Eligible gene libraries were conformed to a suitable platform, HiSeq/MiSeq (The Beijing Genomics Institute, Shenzhen, China).

Raw data were filtered to generate high quality clean reads, tags connected, OTU clustered, OTU taxonomy annotated and α‐ and β‐diversity analysed. The composition of species was visualized by the circlize package of R (VER NO.3.6.3). Shannon and Chao indices represent diversity and richness worked out by QIIME (VER NO.1.7.0). In order to work out the metaged UniFrac, the QIIME software (VER NO.1.9.1) was also used. Then most core coordinate analysis was confirmed so as to obtain the coordinates and to visualize for complicated, multi‐dimensional data packed through the WGCNA and the ggplot2 parcel in R (VER NO.2.15.3).

Functional genes were classified according to KEGG, and the predicted results of the KEGG function abundance of the bacterial community were obtained by using PICRUSt2 (VER NO.2.2.0.b) and R (VER NO.DABAO 3.4.10).

All data have been expressed as mean ± standard error (SE). One‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed using Origin2018 (OriginLab, Northampton, USA) and IBM SPSS Statistics 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), and the differences were considered termed significant (p< 0.05).

The growth performance of broilers is shown in Table1. During the experiment, the disposition, water consumption and faeces of the broilers of the healthy control group (G8) were normal. The feed intake in the G7 group was found to be significantly decreased (−27.40%;p< 0.05) after the infection with coccidias compared to the G8 group. The feed intake of the CIN‐treated groups was significantly improved, respectively, when stack up against the G7;p< 0.05), whereas only the PACDs have demonstrated significant improvements (12.74%) in that same respect. The weight gain of broilers has shown that the WGR values of CIN groups were significantly increased, but no obvious difference was discovered in G1, G2 and G3. After 14 days of feeding, the FCR of the CIN group's broilers was significantly reduced. In fact, the FCR of the G6 group (supplemented with 250 mg/kg CIN) was found to be reduced by 33.98% when compared with the G7 group. Although feed intake decreased in infected PACDs and CIN intervention groups, the feed intake of CIN treatment group recovered effectively. Furthermore, the feed conversion rate also be decreased. We can conclude that CIN may have a positive effect on the performance of coccidia‐infected broilers, especially restoring feed intake.

Performance data of broilers fed different diets and treatments.

Note: Means within a row with different superscripts (a–f) are significantly different (p< 0.05).

Total feed intake of 30 broilers for 14 days in each group.

Total weight gain of 30 broilers for 14 days in each group.

During the 14 days of feeding, the broilers infected with spore oocysts gradually lost appetite and developed poor mental health. The amount of food and water intake was decreased to varying degrees in the infected groups. The feed and water intakes of the broilers belonging to the four infected groups were seriously reduced by the 5th and the 6th day. There were no dead broilers in any of the eight test groups.

The inhibitory effect of CIN on coccidia in broilers is shown in Table2. The results showed that oocyst value in CIN group was significantly reduced, and oocyst value in medium‐ and high‐dose groups even dropped to 0, and the intervention effect was unexpectedly better than that in PACDs group.

Results of growth performance and anticoccidial index (ACI) of broilers infected with mixedEimeriastrains.

Note: ACI < 160, it is judged as positive (+); ACI ≥ 160, it is judged as negative (−), indicates low drug resistant; 160 ≤ ACI < 180 indicates intermediate drug resistant; ACI ≥ 180 indicates high drug resistant.

After CIN feed intervention and coccidian cyst infection 12 days, all experimental broilers were dissected, and the damage to their small intestine and cecum was observed, mainly including the appearance of bloody stool and intestinal lesions. The bleeding stools of experimental broilers were observed 108 h after infection with coccidian cysts (Figure1a). The area of blood in the G1, G2 and G7 groups exceeded 75%, whereas the area of blood in the G3 group was more than 50%, and the area of blood in the G4 group was less than 25%. No pathological changes were observed in the intestines of healthy non‐infected broilers G8 group. No blood was found in the G5, G6 and G8 groups. The lesion value of cecum was measured after broiler slaughtering (Figure1b). The lesions infected with coccidia were eventually concentrated in duodenum and cecum. Slight pathological changes were observed in the low dosage G4 group with a small number of bleeding spots on the mucosal surface of the duodenum and hyperaemia and swelling of the intestinal wall. Although the pathological changes alleviate significantly in middle dosage G5 group and high dosage G6 group, the intervention effect of CIN was obviously superior to PACDs.



Blood stools in faeces of broilers infected with coccidian after 108 h (a) and cecum lesions of broilers infected with coccidian after 120 h (b). G1–G8 represent G1 group to G8 group, respectively. The yellow arrows point to the bloody stools, and red arrows point to the lesion.

In order to better reflect the anticoccidia effect of CIN, a resistance characteristic ACI was determined and analysed. The results indicated that the ACI values of G1, G2 and G3 groups were all less than 120, exhibiting an ineffective anticoccidial effect. The ACI value of G4 group was 149.31, belonging low‐efficiency anticoccidial effect. The ACI values of G5 and G6 groups were higher than 180, undoubtedly being high anticoccidial effect, which approached the level of G8 group (Table2). The result showed that the ACI of G1, G2, G3 Gand G4 groups was positive with drug resistance, whereas that of G5 and G6 groups was negative without drug resistance.

The bacterial flora in duodenum, small intestine and cecum contents of broilers treated with CIN were studied by 16s rDND metagenomics (Figure2a–c). The main effects analysis indicated that G8 healthy control group and G7 test control group demonstrated a notable margin (p< 0.05) in terms of their Shannon value and Chao index. Compared to the G7 group, the Shannon value and the Chao index were also found to be significantly reduced (p< 0.05) in the PACD‐treated groups, meaning that the total number and the diversity of the intestinal flora decreased. Conversely, the Shannon value and the Chao index of the CIN‐treated groups were found to be significantly increased (p< 0.05), especially high dosage group.



The Shannon value, Chao value and PCoA of microbial flora in duodenum (a), small intestine (b) and cecum (c) of broilers.

To further investigate the changes in the key microflora in each group, core microbiota analysis was applied to demonstrate the dominant microorganisms in the groups (Figure3a–c). After broilers were infected with coccidia, the intestinalAcinetobacterandEscherichiaincreased significantly, whereas the healthy group, CIN intervention groups and PACDs intervention groups did not observe this phenomenon. TheLactobacilluswas significantly stimulated (p< 0.05) in the CIN groups compared to infected group in small intestine of broilers. After CIN intervention, the abundance ofFaecalibaculum(Figure3c) significantly increased, with a more pronounced effect observed in the low/high‐dose groups in cecum of broilers. Compared with coccidian‐infected broilers in G7 group, the relative abundance ofClostridiumX1Vb in all experimental groups was significantly decreased (p< 0.05), especially in G4, G6 and G8 groups.



Dominant genera in the intestines of broilers in the duodenum (a), small intestine (b) and cecum (c and d) of broilers.

To elucidate the potential mechanism of CIN inhibition on coccidia growth, we performed KEGG prediction of intestinal function in infected broilers after CIN intervention (Figure4).



The predicted KEGG function in microbial flora of duodenum (a), small intestine (b) and cecum (c).

The results have shown that the intestines of broilers, the Krebs cycle, membrane transport genes, metabolic genes and the supersession of terpenoids and polyketides, energy metabolism and membrane transport were all positively correlated with the CIN groups.

In this development, the appetite and feed intake of broilers that were infected with coccidia were seriously affected, and the intestinal absorption function of broilers with coccidiosis was severely impaired, resulting in an increase in feed conversion rate. At present, the main treatment method of broiler coccidiosis is to use the chemical drug PACDs, but the long‐term use of PACDs leads to the emergence of serious drug resistance. In recent years, many plant extracts have become potential candidates in search of alternative methods to treat coccidiosis in broilers. Some recent studies have shown that a CIN extracted from eucalyptus leaves has good fat solubility and therefore strong antibacterial and anti‐inflammatory effects (Aduayi et al.2024). Therefore, we hypothesized that this fat‐soluble eucalyptus leaf extract may also have an inhibitory effect on coccidia.

In this study, we designed to treat and intervene young broilers infected with coccidia with different concentrations of CIN. During the trial, it was found that compared with healthy chickens, after infection, broilers had loss of appetite, decreased feed efficiency, significant weight loss and the feed intake of the G7 group infected with coccidia was 27.40% below than G8 group (p< 0.05). Furthermore, there were obvious bloody stool, a large number of coccidium oocysts in faeces and pathological changes of intestinal haemorrhagic spots and swelling.

The feed conversion rate increased, and the relative weight gain rate decreased when treated with PACDs. Although the intestinal damage value and oocyst number decreased in the high‐dose group, the treatment effect was not obvious in the medium–low‐dose group, and obvious drug resistance occurred in all the dose groups after PACDs treatment. After CIN intervention, the feed conversion rate of broilers decreased, the relative weight gain rate and body weight increased significantly, intestinal bleeding points of broilers were reduced, swelling was reduced, and no oocysts were found in faeces of the medium–high‐dose group, and drug resistance was not observed. The ADFI values of the three CIN groups significantly increased (p< 0.05), whereas their FCR values significantly decreased (p< 0.05). The FCR value of the high‐dose CIN‐treated group was 33.98% below than the G7 group.

ACI index is a comprehensive index to measure the ability of an anticoccidia drug to inhibit the growth and reproduction and reduce the harm of coccidia infection. After the use of a highly effective anticoccidia drug, it can significantly reduce the amount of oocysts in animal faeces and reduce the clinical symptoms caused, and correspondingly, its ACI index will be higher, indicating that the drug has strong anticoccidia efficacy. The ACI values of all PACD groups were less than 120, and the G2 group demonstrated the most obvious drug resistance in this study. The ACI values of the middle‐dose and the high‐dose CIN groups were higher than 180. It indicated that feed with CIN can be effectively protected against coccidiosis for broilers, but the addition amount should be equal to or exceed 150 mg/kg.

As for the inhibitory mechanism of CIN on coccidia, we speculated that it may be related to its damaging effect on cell membrane and anti‐inflammatory effect (Sun et al.2018). Among them, CIN may interact with the membrane lipids of coccidia through its good lipid solubility, resulting in changes in membrane permeability and leakage of intracellular substances, thus killing the oocysts and inhibiting their reproduction (Domagoj et al.2016). In addition, according to previous literatures (Martins et al.2017), CIN's alleviating effect on intestinal mucosal inflammation may be through promoting the release of anti‐inflammatory factors, thus participating in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses.

The gastrointestinal tract of domestic fowl is a sophisticated microecological system. These microbes affect considerably in the absorption of nutrients, the normal development of the intestinal morphology, the digestive function and the establishment of immune function and disease resistance (Leser and Mølbak2009).

As for the inhibitory effect of CIN on coccidia, in addition to the direct inhibition on the growth of coccidia, it indirectly affected the growth of coccidia through the change of intestinal flora. In this study, it was found that CIN supplementation had different degrees of influence on microflora in small intestine and cecum of broilers. As a result of low pH and high flow rate of the intestinal environment, the abundance and diversity index of the small intestine and duodenum were low. Compared with G7 group, the Shannon value and the Chao index of the CIN‐treated groups were identified as significantly increased (p< 0.05); meanwhile, these same parameters were found to be significantly decreased in the PACDs (p< 0.05). The phenomenon showed that the diversity of the intestinal microflora of broilers was significantly decreased and that the total bacterial count was sharply decreased after the infection. Moreover, CIN could play a role in regulating the flora diversity and structure disrupted by coccidia. This study first demonstrated the role of CIN as an important factor in maintaining the stability of the broilers’ intestinal flora.

Our experiment showed that by adding CIN in the broiler feed, it can achieve an obvious anticoccidial effect. In addition, the CIN could maintain the stability of the intestinal flora of broilers infected with coccidian. However, coccidian was killed by PACDs, but some of the beneficial gut bacteria were also destroyed.

The digested matter then proceeds to the cecum, which is mainly to degrade the indigestible plant materials and to absorb water, glucose and volatile fatty acids. Therefore, the bacterial abundance and diversity index in the cecum were increased (Figure3a–c). The species composition has shown that obligate anaerobes (includingClostridiumXVIII,Uminococcus2,Lactobacillus,Bacillus,Lachnospira,BifidobacteriumandSubdoligranulum) in the cecum were the most abundant. The relative abundance ofFaecalibacteriumin G7 group significantly reduced (p< 0.05) compared with G8 (Figure3d), which were not significant in G5 and G6 groups.Faecalibacteriumcan bacterium ferment dietary fibre, promote the digestion and absorption of feed fibre components of broilers, produce short‐chain fatty acids (SCFAs), improve the physiological state of intestinal tract, promote the growth and development of intestinal villi and help broilers better absorb nutrients in feed and promote the growth of broilers. These results were consistent with our previously observed results. The relative abundance ofEscherichiain G7 group significantly raise (p< 0.05) contrasit with G8 group, whereas there was no change (p> 0.05) in G3 and G5 groups.

In our study, the abundance ofClostridiumX1Vb in the intestines of coccidian‐infected broilers after CIN treatment was significantly decreased compared to G8 group, as previous researchers found thatClostridiumX1Vb may take advantage of the damaged intestinal environment to proliferate. The toxins produced by it will further aggravate the damage of intestinal mucosa, destroy the tight connection of intestinal epithelial cells and lead to increased intestinal permeability. In addition,ClostridiumX1Vb has a synergistic effect with coccidia, causing more serious intestinal lesions in broilers, such as intestinal bleeding, ulcers and even necrosis. When the integrity of intestinal mucosa is damaged, the absorption of nutrients is seriously affected, and the growth performance of broilers will also decline.

We found thatLactobacilluswas the dominant genus in the small intestine. Compared with G7, the abundance ofLactobacillusin the intestines of broilers after CIN intervention increased significantly. This may be due to the competitive adhesion ofLactobacillusto the mucosa surface of the intestinal tract and the production of organic acids and bacteriocins to inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria and maintain intestinal homeostasis. It can be used as a replacement to low level of antibiotics added in poultry feed (Ullah et al.2021).

In our study, we have systematically investigated the impact of CIN on the function of the broiler intestinal microbes. This study found that CIN can significantly inhibit coccidia infection in broilers and inhibit coccidia growth and reproduction in broilers. The study found that in broilers infected with coccidia and fed CIN, it may be due to the fact that various nutrient substrates in the broiler intestinal tract can be more easily used by microorganisms. The comparatively abundance of related genes among the metabolization of terpenoids and polyketides in the intestinal tract of broilers was also found to be high; a fact that is related to the relative abundance ofActinomycetes, which was consistent with the above results.Actinomycetesare characterized by the decomposition of organic matter and the production of various natural drugs, enzymes and bioactive metabolites. In contrast to PACD, CIN is extracted from natural plant extracts and, therefore, can be easier to digest and metabolized. In general, supplementation of CIN to coccidian‐infected broilers could improve the health status of broilers by altering the intestinal flora and promoting the digestion and absorption of feed components.

Coccidiosis remains a huge threat to broiler farming, and search for more effective treatments to replace the chemotherapy drug PACDs remains one of the challenges facing the industry. This study showed that CIN, as a natural product, possessed good anticoccidial effect, no drug resistance, and could protect the stability of intestinal flora. CIN did not kill all bacteria like PACDS and can also improve the growth performance of broilers. Therefore, CIN as an alternative coccidiosis drug of eucalyptus leaf extract has a good application prospect in poultry breeding such as broilers. Therefore, it is recommended to feed CIN in the high temperature and high humidity season when coccidiosis is high, so as to prevent and control the occurrence of coccidiosis in poultry more effectively.

We demonstrate that, by a proper functionalization of the polysiloxane-based scintillator, it is possible to target the effective detection of different kinds of ionizing radiation. Specifically, besides protons, we develop a device able to detect thermal neutrons, targeting its use during Boron Neutron Capture Therapy. This work demonstrates how organic indirect detectors can be considered a universal radiation detecting platform able to monitor in real time and in situ the dose absorbed by patients during cancer treatments under different kinds of radiation.",{'dataLinkstag': ['altmetrics']},,,2025-04-25,,

This study investigates autophagic (LC3B-II, SQSTM1) and mitophagic (BNIP3L, BNIP3, BCL2L13) markers in the cortex and hippocampus of male and female 3xTg-AD mice, using western blotting, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and behavioral tests (novel object recognition and novel object placement). Significant sex-specific differences emerged: female 3xTg-AD mice exhibited autophagosome accumulation due to impaired degradation in the cortex, while males showed fewer autophagosomes, especially in the hippocampus, without significant degradation changes. TEM analyses demonstrated variations in mitochondrial and mitophagosome numbers correlated with memory outcomes. Females had enhanced mitophagy, with higher BNIP3L and BCL2L13 levels, whereas males showed elevated BNIP3 dimers. Cognitive deficits in females correlated with mitochondrial dysfunction in the cortex, while in males, higher LC3B-II levels associated positively with cognitive performance, suggesting protective autophagy effects. Using machine learning, we predicted mitophagosome and mitochondrial numbers based on behavioral data, pioneering a predictive approach to cellular outcomes in AD. These findings underscore the importance of sex-specific regulation of autophagy and mitophagy in AD and support personalized therapeutic approaches targeting these pathways. Integrating machine learning emphasizes its potential to advance neurodegenerative research.

Macroautophagy and mitophagy are critical processes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), yet their links to behavioral outcomes, particularly sex-specific differences, are not fully understood. This study investigates autophagic (LC3B-II, SQSTM1) and mitophagic (BNIP3L, BNIP3, BCL2L13) markers in the cortex and hippocampus of male and female 3xTg-AD mice, using western blotting, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and behavioral tests (novel object recognition and novel object placement). Significant sex-specific differences emerged: female 3xTg-AD mice exhibited autophagosome accumulation due to impaired degradation in the cortex, while males showed fewer autophagosomes, especially in the hippocampus, without significant degradation changes. TEM analyses demonstrated variations in mitochondrial and mitophagosome numbers correlated with memory outcomes. Females had enhanced mitophagy, with higher BNIP3L and BCL2L13 levels, whereas males showed elevated BNIP3 dimers. Cognitive deficits in females correlated with mitochondrial dysfunction in the cortex, while in males, higher LC3B-II levels associated positively with cognitive performance, suggesting protective autophagy effects. Using machine learning, we predicted mitophagosome and mitochondrial numbers based on behavioral data, pioneering a predictive approach to cellular outcomes in AD. These findings underscore the importance of sex-specific regulation of autophagy and mitophagy in AD and support personalized therapeutic approaches targeting these pathways. Integrating machine learning emphasizes its potential to advance neurodegenerative research.

Subject terms:Macroautophagy, Mitophagy, Cell death in the nervous system

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating and irreversible neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects older adults, leading to severe cognitive decline, memory deficits, and behavioral changes. Pathologically, AD is marked by the presence of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, hyperphosphorylated (p)-MAPT/tau tangles, and the accumulation of dysfunctional and/or damaged mitochondria in the brain [1–4]. Collectively, in humans these pathological features result in synaptic and neuronal loss, particularly in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, regions critical for cognitive function and memory [5,6]. Notably, cortical neurons are more vulnerable to mitochondrial disruption than hippocampal neurons in AD models [7].

A fascinating aspect of AD research is the significant influence of sex on disease risk and progression. Women exhibit a higher incidence and more severe pathology of AD, including impairments in working memory and spatial navigation tasks [8–10]. Imaging studies further reveal a faster annual atrophy rate in female AD patients [11]. Although the exact mechanisms behind these sex differences are not fully understood, factors such as cognitive reserve, genetics, and sex hormones are thought to contribute to differences in AD pathology and progression [12,13].

Sex hormones, particularly estrogen, are pivotal in modulating autophagy and mitochondrial function [14,15]. Estrogen enhances basal autophagy levels, aiding in the clearance of MAPT/tau tangles and Aβ deposits [14]. Moreover, female brains generally exhibit greater mitochondrial function compared to males [15]. Consequently, the decline in estrogen levels in postmenopausal human females significantly reduces mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy in hippocampal neurons [16]. This reduction in mitophagy is particularly concerning because hippocampal mitophagy is essential for sustaining neurogenesis and spatial memory [17].

A novel aspect of AD pathology is the impairment of mitophagy, a selective form of autophagy that removes damaged mitochondria through mitophagosomes, which then fuse with lysosomes to degrade the compromised mitochondria, maintaining cellular health and energy balance [18,19]. Mitophagy operates through various pathways, including those involving outer mitochondrial membrane proteins such as BNIP3 (BCL2/adenovirus E1B interacting protein 3), BNIP3L (BCL2/adenovirus E1B interacting protein 3-like), and BCL2L13 (BCL2 like 13) [20–22]. These proteins interact with MAP1LC3/LC3-II via their LC3-interacting region/LIR, facilitating mitophagosome formation and expansion [22,23].

BCL2-family proteins also play a dual role in regulating mitochondria-mediated cell death pathways [24]. BNIP3, BNIP3L, and BCL2L13 show an interesting interplay between mitophagy and apoptosis, influencing various diseases, including AD [25–27]. Notably, decreased levels of BNIP3L and BNIP3 in AD correlate with diminished mitophagy [28,29].

We utilized novel object placement (NOP) and novel object recognition (NOR) behavioral tests to investigate the severe cognitive abnormalities associated with AD. These tests are powerful tools for assessing memory function, with NOP evaluating hippocampus-dependent spatial memory and NOR involving multiple brain regions, leveraging a mouse’s preference for novelty [30,31]. Exploring the relationship among these behavioral tests and also mechanisms of autophagy and mitophagy could provide groundbreaking insights into AD.

Recognizing that AD is characterized by autophagy and mitophagy impairment influenced by age, sex, and specific brain regions [16,17,32], we embarked on an innovative investigation to assess autophagy and mitophagy-related protein expression levels and also the number of mitochondria and mitophagosomes. Using the 3xTg-AD mouse model, widely recognized for its comprehensive representation of AD pathology [33], we aimed to correlate behavioral test performance in male and female 3xTg-AD mice with autophagy and mitophagy metrics in the cortex and hippocampus. This comprehensive analysis seeks to elucidate the role of mitophagy-related proteins and sex differences in AD pathogenesis, offering potential sex-specific therapeutic targets and paving the way for innovative personalized treatments.

Autophagy plays a critical role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s by regulating the removal of damaged proteins and organelles [34]. We assessed key autophagy markers in 3xTg-AD mice to investigate potential sex-specific differences in AD autophagy pathways. We measured the amount of the phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated form of MAP1LC3B/LC3B, LC3B-II (Fig.1A), an indicator of autophagosomes. In female 3xTg-AD mice, LC3B-II levels in the cortex were significantly elevated compared to controls (P< 0.05; Fig.1B), indicating an accumulation of autophagosomes, which could reflect autophagy induction or a block in degradation/autophagosome turnover. In male 3xTg-AD mice, LC3B-II levels were reduced in both the cortex and hippocampus as compared to controls, with a significant decrease in the hippocampus (P< 0.05; Fig.1C), suggesting fewer autophagosomes. The autophagic receptor and substrate SQSTM1, which marks autophagosome degradation, is depicted in Fig.1Dthrough western blot analysis. Higher SQSTM1 levels in the cortex (P< 0.05; Fig.1E) suggest impaired autophagosome degradation as the cause of LC3B-II accumulation. SQSTM1 levels in males did not differ significantly from controls (P> 0.05; Fig.1F), indicating no major impairment in autophagosome degradation. These findings suggest sex-specific alterations in autophagy regulation in AD, with females showing autophagosome accumulation in the cortex due to impaired degradation, while males exhibit fewer autophagosomes, particularly in the hippocampus, without significant changes in degradation.

Results show significantly lower autophagosome degradation (SQSTM1) and higher autophagosome marker (LC3B-II) in the cortex of 3xTg-AD females (P< 0.05). In 3xTg-AD males, there was a significant reduction in the autophagosome marker (LC3B-II) in the hippocampus (P< 0.05). In contrast, no significant differences were found in autophagosome degradation (SQSTM1) in both the cortex and hippocampus (P> 0.05). Statistical analyses were performed using a two-way ANOVA test. *P< 0.05; **P< 0.01. Data are presented as mean ± SD, withn= 5 per group (n= 5 females andn= 5 males).

The BCL2 family proteins BNIP3L, BNIP3, and BCL2L13 play a key role in regulating mitophagy [35–37], a process crucial for maintaining mitochondrial integrity. In this study, we explored sex-specific differences in the expression of these proteins in Alzheimer’s disease to understand their potential impact on mitophagy.

To this end, we measured cortical and hippocampal levels of outer mitochondrial membrane proteins BNIP3L, BNIP3, and BCL2L13 using western blot analysis to examine potential changes in mitophagy activity (Figs.2,3,4). BNIP3L dimers more efficiently recruit phagophores than the monomeric form [38]. The BNIP3L monomer levels were significantly higher in the cortex (P< 0.0001) and hippocampus of 3xT-AD female mice (P< 0.001; Fig.2C) but not in males (Fig.2D). Female 3xTg-AD mice also showed lower BNIP3L dimer levels in the hippocampus (P< 0.001) and higher levels in the cortex (P< 0.001; Fig.2E) compared to controls. In the male group, no significant differences in BNIP3L dimer levels were found between control and 3xTg-AD (Fig.2F).

Comparing the control and 3xTg-AD groups, a significantly higher BNIP3L dimer level was found in the cortex (P< 0.01), while a lower level was observed in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD females (P< 0.01). No significant differences in BNIP3L monomer or dimer levels were found between control and AD males.

BNIP3 monomer expression was significantly lower in the cortex (P< 0.01) and hippocampus (P< 0.001) of 3xTg-AD females than in control, while no significant differences were found in male groups.E,FQuantification of BNIP3 dimer levels in females and males, respectively. Our investigation showed higher BNIP3 dimer level in the cortex (P< 0.0001) and the hippocampus (P< 0.05) of the 3xTg-AD male group and also in the cortex (P< 0.05) of 3xTg-AD female compared to the control. Statistical analyses were performed using a two-way ANOVA test. *P< 0.05; **P< 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P< 0.0001. The results are presented as the mean ± SD,n= 5 per group (n= 5 females andn= 5 males).

BCL2L13 expression in the cortex (P< 0.0001) and the hippocampus (P< 0.01) of 3xTg-AD females is higher than in control.DQuantification of the expression levels of BCL2L13 in the cortex and hippocampus of male 3xTg-AD and control mice. No significant differences were found in male groups. Statistical analyses were performed using a two-way ANOVA test. *P< 0.05; **P< 0.01; ***P< 0.001; ****P< 0.0001. The results are presented as the mean ± SD,n= 5 per group (n= 5 females andn= 5 males).

Similar to BNIP3L, BNIP3 also dimerizes, which is important for functions including lysosomal delivery [38,39]. Figures3A, Bshow western blot analysis of BNIP3 monomer and dimer in female and male mice. The expression of the BNIP3 monomer was significantly lower in the cortex (P< 0.01) and hippocampus (P< 0.001) of the 3xTg-AD female group compared to the control group (Fig.3C). In contrast, no significant differences were observed in the male groups (Fig.3D). In our study of the 3xTg-AD female group, we found higher levels of the BNIP3 dimer in the cortex (P< 0.05; Fig.3E) compared to the control group. However, we did notice higher levels of the BNIP3 dimer in the cortex (P< 0.0001) and hippocampus of male 3xTg-AD mice (P< 0.05; Fig.3F).

The western blot analysis of BCL2L13 in female and male mice is illustrated in Fig.4A, B. In female mice, BCL2L13 expression in the cortex (P< 0.0001) and the hippocampus (P< 0.01) was higher than in the control (Fig.4C). No significant differences were found in the male groups (Fig.4D).

These findings reveal significant sex-specific differences in the expression of BCL2-family proteins that regulate mitophagy, suggesting potential changes in mitophagy activity. In females, elevated BNIP3L and BCL2L13 levels in the cortex and hippocampus point to enhanced mitophagy, while males exhibited increased BNIP3 dimer levels, particularly in the cortex. These results indicate that sex may influence mitochondrial maintenance and degradation pathways in Alzheimer’s disease.

Maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis is crucial in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD [40]. In this study, we aimed to examine sex-specific differences in mitochondrial content and mitophagy activity by quantifying mitochondria and mitophagosome numbers in 3xTg-AD mice using TEM. Using TEM (Fig.5A), we identified the number of mitophagosomes and mitochondria in the cortex and hippocampus of control and 3xTg-AD groups. The number of mitochondria in the cortex of male 3xTg-AD mice was significantly lower than in the control group (P< 0.01; Fig.5B).



ATransmission electron microscopy images of the cortex and hippocampus in male and female control and 3xTg-AD mice. Arrows indicate mitophagosomes and mitochondria.B,CQuantification of mitochondria in the cortex of female and male mice, respectively. The lower number of mitochondria in the cortex (P < 0.001) and hippocampus (P< 0.0001) of 3xTg-AD females indicates potentially higher mitophagy rates in the AD compared to the control female group. In males, the potential mitophagy rate in the cortex of the 3xTg-AD group is significantly higher than the control (P< 0.01).D,EQuantification of mitophagosomes in the cortex of female and male mice, respectively. A significant increase in the mitophagosome number of the cortex in male 3xTg-AD compared to the control (P< 0.01) indicates a potentially higher mitophagy rate (or lower mitophagosome degradation) in male 3xTg-AD compared to the control. Similarly, in females, the number of mitophagosomes is significantly increased in the cortex (P< 0.0001) and the hippocampus (P< 0.0001) of 3xTg-AD compared to the control group, indicating a potentially higher mitophagy rate (or lower mitophagosome degradation) in the cortex and hippocampus of AD compared to control. Statistical analyses were performed using a two-way ANOVA test. *P< 0.05; **P< 0.01; ***P< 0.001; ns, non-significant. The results are presented as the means ± SD.

Additionally, we observed a significantly higher number of mitochondria in the cortex (P< 0.001) and hippocampus (P< 0.0001) of female controls compared to the 3xTg-AD group (Fig.5C). Our assessment indicated the number of mitophagosomes was significantly higher in the cortex (P< 0.0001) and hippocampus (P< 0.0001) of male 3xTg-AD mice compared to the control group (Fig.5D). Similarly, a significant increase in the number of mitophagosomes in the cortex of female 3xTg-AD mice compared to the control group (P< 0.01; Fig.5E).

Our findings exhibited similar trends in both the cortex and hippocampus. However, there were significant differences between the two sexes. For example, the number of mitochondria in male mice showed no statistical difference in the hippocampus and a relatively small difference in the cortex. In contrast, female mice displayed much larger differences in both locations. Conversely, the number of mitophagosomes in the hippocampus was substantially higher in the 3xTg-AD male mice compared to the control, whereas there was no statistical difference in the female mice. These results suggest that mitophagy may be differentially regulated between males and females in AD.

Progressive cognitive decline is the typical clinical feature of AD [1]. Mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy failure are possible mechanisms of cognitive deficits in AD [4]. Therefore, we next examined the contribution of neuronal mitophagy on learning and memory impairments in 3xTg-AD mice. Spatial and non-spatial memory was investigated in 3xTg-AD mice compared to control mice using novel object placement (NOP for spatial memory) and novel object recognition (NOR for non-spatial memory) behavioral tests. During the NOR test, female 3xTg-AD mice exhibited less preference for the novel object compared to control females (P< 0.0001) and also 3xTg-AD males (P< 0.01), but no significant difference was observed between male 3xTg-AD mice and the control group (P> 0.05) (Fig.6A). In the NOP test, there were no significant differences in preference index between female or male 3xTg-AD mice and controls (P> 0.05) (Fig.6B). These results indicate non-spatial memory deficits in female 3xTg-AD mice, but not in male, as demonstrated by the NOR test.



AMemory impairment (NOR test) comparison between female and male control and 3xTg-AD mice. Females exhibited significant non-spatial memory deficits compared to 3xTg-AD males (P< 0.01) and the female control group (P < 0.0001).BSpatial memory impairment (NOP test) comparison between female and male control and 3xTg-AD mice. Our analysis showed no significant differences in spatial memory between male and female 3xTg-AD mice and controls. Statistical analyses were performed using a two-way ANOVA test. **P < 0.01; ****P< 0.0001; ns, non-significant. Data are presented as mean ± SD,n= 5 per group (n= 5 females,n= 5 males).

We further evaluated the correlations of behavior findings with expression levels of the autophagy-related proteins LC3B-II and SQSTM1 in the cortex and hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice. The results of the Spearman’s correlation test showed that the autophagosome (LC3B-II) levels in the cortex of male 3xTg-AD mice were negatively correlated with the NOP test (r= −1.000,P= 0.010; Fig.7A), but positively correlated with the preference index of the novel object in the NOR test (r= 1.000,P= 0.010; Fig.7B). In contrast, in females, no associations were found between autophagosome levels and NOR (Fig.S1A) or NOP tests (Fig.S1B). Additionally, we did not find a significant association between autophagosome degradation (SQSTM1) levels and memory impairment in females and males (Fig.S2A–D).



A,BAssociation of LC3B-II levels (autophagosomes) with the NOP and NOR test in males, respectively. In females, no association was found between autophagosome and spatial memory impairment (P˃ 0.05; see the supplement). In male mice, a negative correlation was observed between LC3B-II levels in the cortex and the NOP test, suggesting lower autophagosome levels are associated with better memory performance (NOP) (P= 0.010). Conversely, higher LC3B-II levels in the cortex of male 3xTg-AD are associated with greater memory (P= 0.010). Spearman’s correlation test was used for statistical analysis, withP-value < 0.05 considered significant.

We also performed correlation analyses between behavior findings and the BCL2-family proteins involved in mitophagy, including BNIP3L, BNIP3, and BCL2L13, as well as mitochondrial and mitophagosome numbers in the cortex and hippocampus of female and male 3xTg-AD mice. Our results showed that higher hippocampal BCL2L13 levels in females (r= 0.900,P= 0.037; Fig.8A) were correlated with greater non-spatial memory in the NOR test. Similarly, BNIP3L dimer levels in the cortex of females were positively correlated with spatial memory impairment (r= 0.900,P= 0.037; Fig.8B), while BNIP3L monomer expression levels were not associated with any behavior findings (Fig.S3A–D).

Analysis shows a lower mitochondria number in the cortex correlated with greater non-spatial memory in female 3xTg-AD mice (P = 0.010).DCorrelation of NOR test with mitophagosome number in the cortex and hippocampus of female 3xTg-AD mice. The number of mitophagosomes in the cortex was significantly positively correlated with the NOR behavior of females (P= 0.041). Spearman’s correlation test was used for statistical analysis, with aP-value < 0.05 considered statistically significant. BNIP3L, BCL2/adenovirus E1B interacting protein 3-like; BCL2L13, BCL2 like 13; NOR, novel object recognition; NOP, novel object placement.

Our results also demonstrated that the NOR behavior of female 3xTg-AD mice was negatively correlated with the number of mitochondria in the cortex (r= −1.000,P= 0.010; Fig.8C), but positively correlated with mitophagosomes number (r= 0.894,P= 0.041; Fig.8D). This suggests a possible link between mitophagy in cortex neurons and cognitive decline in female 3xTg-AD mice. No significant correlations were observed between mitophagosome and mitochondrial numbers in the cortex and hippocampus of male subjects with memory (Fig.S4A, B). Furthermore, the number of mitochondria and mitophagosomes in both the cortex and hippocampus were not significantly related to the NOP test in females and males (Fig.S5A–D).

Leveraging the behavioral data, we applied machine learning to predict the number of mitophagosomes and mitochondria in both the cortex and hippocampus, aiming to bridge cognitive behavior with underlying cellular dynamics. For mitophagosome prediction, the best-performing model achieved the highest accuracy in the hippocampus (R² = 0.57, MAE = 8.9), whereas predictions in the cortex were moderately reliable (R² = 0.27, MAE = 8.5). In contrast, for mitochondrial number predictions, the cortex yielded the highest accuracy (R² = 0.47, MAE = 1.7), whereas predictions in the hippocampus were notably less reliable (R² = 0.001, MAE = 2.56). The prediction framework demonstrated favorable prediction accuracy in the number of mitophagosomes in the cortex and hippocampus and the number of mitochondria in the cortex (Fig.9A–C). However, the prediction for the number of hippocampus mitochondria based on behavior data was not meaningful (Fig.9D). This could be due to the limited sample size and the lack of a relationship between the number of hippocampal mitochondria and behavioral data (P> 0.32, Spearman correlation test).

Our study provides essential insights into the roles of autophagy and mitophagy in AD, with a specific focus on sex-specific differences that may influence the progression of the disease. Dysregulation of autophagy and mitophagy has been increasingly recognized as a significant contributor to AD pathogenesis, particularly through the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and MAPT/tau tangles, hallmark features of the disease [41–47].

In this investigation, we identified sex-specific variations in key autophagy markers, particularly LC3B-II and SQSTM1, in the cortex and hippocampus, two brain regions critically involved in cognitive functions [48–50]. Specifically, in female 3xTg-AD mice, LC3B-II levels were significantly elevated in the cortex, indicating autophagosome accumulation due to impaired autophagosome degradation, as supported by elevated SQSTM1 levels. In contrast, male 3xTg-AD mice exhibited reduced LC3B-II levels with no significant change in SQSTM1 in the hippocampus and cortex, suggesting fewer autophagosomes, but no major change in degradation pathways. This finding suggests that autophagic flux—the efficiency of autophagy—may be differentially regulated between males and females, potentially contributing to the observed differences in AD progression [51]. The differential regulation of these markers may also reflect a more pronounced attempt at a compensatory autophagic response in females due to greater mitochondrial or protein damage, which may also contribute to sex differences in AD progression.

Mitophagy is critical in neurons, where mitochondrial dysfunction has been strongly linked to AD [52,53]. Mitochondria are essential for energy production and regulation of cellular metabolism, and their dysfunction can lead to increased oxidative stress and neuronal death, both of which are implicated in the neurodegenerative processes observed in AD [54,55]. Our study reveals significant sex-specific differences in mitophagy-related proteins, such as BNIP3L, BNIP3, and BCL2L13, across the cortex and hippocampus. For example, the higher levels of BNIP3L dimers observed in female 3xTg-AD mice suggest enhanced mitophagy activity, which might indicate a more robust response to mitochondrial damage [56,57]. This enhanced mitophagy activity is further supported by our observation of reduced mitochondrial numbers in the TEM analysis, indicating a degradation defect in the female brain.

Conversely, the reduced expression of BNIP3 monomer in females with AD and the increased level of BNIP3 dimer in males suggest a potential impairment in mitophagy in females, leading to the accumulation of damaged mitochondria. This impairment could exacerbate oxidative stress and promote neurodegeneration, contributing to the observed sex differences in AD progression [58,59]. The differential regulation of BCL2L13, a protein involved in mitophagy, further highlights the complexity of these sex-specific differences. We observed higher BCL2L13 levels in the AD females, which was not seen in males. These patterns suggest that BCL2L13-dependent mitophagy pathways are differentially regulated between sexes, potentially contributing to the observed differences in mitochondrial turnover and AD progression.

In this study, we utilized two distinct behavioral tests to assess memory: NOR, which evaluates non-spatial memory, and NOP, which assesses spatial memory. These tests capture different facets of memory function—NOR focusing on recognition of object novelty, while NOP reflects memory for object location in space. This distinction provides a broader understanding of memory function by examining both spatial and non-spatial memory domains, offering insights into specific cognitive processes impacted by autophagy and mitophagy. Therefore, these molecular findings are corroborated by the behavioral outcomes observed in our study. The significant cognitive deficits displayed by female 3xTg-AD mice in the NOR test were closely associated with altered autophagy and mitophagy markers, particularly in the cortex. In females, the lack of significant associations between autophagy markers (LC3B-II, SQSTM1) and behavior suggests that mitochondrial health may play a more dominant role in determining cognitive outcomes, with a negative correlation observed between NOR performance and mitochondrial number in the cortex, and a positive correlation with mitophagosome number, indicating impaired mitochondrial turnover as a possible contributor to cognitive decline in AD. This highlights the importance of maintaining mitochondrial health in preventing or slowing the progression of neurodegenerative diseases [60,61].

In contrast, in male mice, a positive correlation was observed between LC3B-II levels and NOR performance, suggesting that preserving autophagic flux could protect against cognitive decline. Notably, LC3B-II levels in males negatively correlated with NOP performance, hinting at a differential effect of autophagy on non-spatial and spatial memory. Additionally, higher hippocampal BCL2L13 levels in females were correlated with better NOR performance, while BNIP3L dimers in the cortex correlated with impaired NOP performance, potentially linking these mitophagy proteins to distinct aspects of memory in a sex-specific manner.

Overall, the observed differences between males and females in the correlations between autophagy and mitophagy markers with cognitive outcomes underscore the complexity of these mechanisms and suggest that mitochondrial quality and autophagic processes may impact memory domains in a sex-dependent manner.

Autophagy and mitophagy play crucial roles in maintaining neuronal health, particularly in the cortex and hippocampus [62], which are key regions involved in cognition and memory. Dysregulation of these processes can lead to the accumulation of damaged proteins and organelles, contributing to neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline [47]. Studies have shown that impaired autophagy and mitophagy are associated with the accumulation of amyloid-beta and MAPT/tau pathology, which are linked to synaptic dysfunction and memory deficits in Alzheimer disease [63,64]. Specifically, in the hippocampus, a region critical for learning and memory, autophagy failure has been correlated with impaired synaptic plasticity, leading to deficits in spatial memory and learning [65,66]. In the cortex, autophagy and mitophagy dysfunction can affect the processing and integration of cognitive information, contributing to the behavioral and cognitive symptoms observed in Alzheimer disease [62]. This underscores the importance of these cellular processes in the pathophysiology of AD and their potential as therapeutic targets.

Our study also demonstrates the potential of machine learning as a powerful tool for predicting disease progression and tailoring therapeutic interventions in AD. By integrating complex molecular and behavioral datasets, we achieved high prediction accuracy for mitophagosome and mitochondrial numbers in the cortex and hippocampus. This approach not only enhances our understanding of the relationships between autophagy, mitophagy, and cognitive function, but also provides a framework for identifying potential biomarkers of AD progression. In our machine learning analysis, we observed that the prediction of mitophagosomes was more reliable in the hippocampus, likely due to distinct region-specific mechanisms that influence mitophagy. In contrast, mitochondrial predictions were more accurate in the cortex, which may reflect the differing metabolic demands of these regions. It should also be noted that, due to the nature of the dataset, only two behavioral features were included as predictors, which limits the depth of feature interpretability. Future studies should incorporate a broader range of behavioral data, not only to enhance prediction performance, but also to identify the most relevant behavioral features associated with cellular outcomes in AD.

The application of machine learning in this context is particularly promising for the development of personalized medicine in AD. Predictive models could help identify patients most likely to benefit from therapies targeting autophagy and mitophagy pathways, leading to more effective and individualized treatment strategies. As our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of AD continues to grow, the integration of machine learning and other advanced computational tools will be crucial in translating these findings into clinical practice [67,68].

In conclusion, our study highlights the significant sex-specific differences in autophagy and mitophagy pathways in AD, with females showing increased autophagosome accumulation and enhanced mitophagy, particularly in the cortex, while males exhibit fewer autophagosomes and increased BNIP3-mediated mitophagy. These findings suggest that targeting autophagy and mitophagy pathways in a sex-specific manner could lead to more effective therapeutic interventions for AD. The differential regulation of these processes between males and females underscores the need for personalized therapeutic approaches that consider the unique molecular and behavioral profiles of each patient. Additionally, the integration of machine learning into AD research offers a promising avenue for developing predictive models that could guide future therapeutic interventions. As we continue to explore the intricate connections among autophagy, mitophagy, and AD, our findings pave the way for new strategies aimed at mitigating the impact of this devastating disease.

Eleven-month-old male and female 3xTg and C57BL/6 mice (n= 10 per genotype;n= 5 female,n= 5 male) were used (the justification of sample size was explained in details in the supplementary materials). The 3xTg strain, carrying APPSwe, PSEN1M146V, and MAPT/TauP301L mutations, was maintained on a C57BL/6 background for over eight generations. Mice were housed in a pathogen-free facility at the St. Boniface Hospital Research Centre under a 12-h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. All procedures were approved by the University of Manitoba Animal Care and Use Committee, following Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines, and compliant with ARRIVE guidelines. A summary of the entire experimental procedure is presented in Scheme1.



Summary of the method: In this study, 11-month-old male and female 3xTg-AD and C57BL/6 mice were subjected to behavioral tests, including Novel Object Recognition and Object Placement tests, to assess cognitive performance. Brain tissues were extracted for protein analysis using western blotting and for the quantification of mitochondria and mitophagosomes through transmission electron microscopy. These steps aim to examine autophagy and mitophagy in relation to AD progression. The entire experimental workflow is summarized in Scheme 1 for a comprehensive visual overview.

Mice were euthanized by decapitation under isoflurane anesthesia. Hippocampal and cerebral cortex (hereafter cortex) tissues were extracted, washed with PBS, and homogenized in ice-cold RIPA buffer containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). Homogenates were centrifuged, and supernatants were stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were measured using a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) as described previously [69].

Hippocampal and cortical homogenates were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE using Criterion™ TGX Stain-Free™ gels (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked in TBS-T with 5% BSA. The following primary antibodies were used: Total OXPHOS Rodent WB Antibody Cocktail (ab110413, Abcam), 1:1000 dilution; BNIP3L/NIX (D4R4B, Cell Signaling Technology), 1:1000 dilution; LC3B-II (048M4810V, Sigma-Aldrich), 1:4000 dilution; BCL2L13 (16612-1-AP, ProteinTech), 1:1000 dilution; BNIP3 (CS3769, Cell Signaling Technology), 1:1000 dilution; and SQSTM1/p62 (D1Q5S, Cell Signaling Technology), 1:1000 dilution. Secondary antibodies included goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) and goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), both at 1:2000 dilution. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) was performed using the Clarity ECL kit (Bio-Rad) and imaged with the ChemiDoc™ MP system. Densitometry was quantified using ImageLab™ software, and normalized to total protein (all original blots have been shown in the supplementary file).

Mice were perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Hippocampal and cortical tissues were fixed in Karnovsky’s fixative, post-fixed in osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded in Epon resin. TEM imaging was performed using a Morgagni 268D electron microscope (Philips). Mitochondria and mitophagosomes were identified and quantified per cell. Mitochondria were identified by their double-membrane structure, typical size (0.5–1 μm), and intact cristae. Damaged mitochondria exhibited swollen or disrupted cristae. Mitophagosomes, larger than mitochondria, contained mitochondrial remnants within double-membrane vesicles, indicating degradation. Autophagosomes, also double-membraned, enclosed diverse cytoplasmic components marked for degradation. Multiple sections per sample were analyzed, and mitochondria, mitophagosomes, and autophagosomes were quantified per cell for statistical analysis.

Behavioral testing was conducted on 11-month-old male and female 3xTg-AD and C57BL/6 mice(n= 10 per genotype;n= 5 female,n= 5 male), seven days prior to euthanasia for tissue collection for western blotting and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The Novel Object Recognition (NOR) and Novel Object Placement (NOP) tests were designed to assess cognitive deficits related to memory and spatial recognition in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The NOR test evaluates non-spatial forms of memory while the NOP test evaluates spatial memory. 1—Familiarization (Habituation Phase): In the initial phase, mice were exposed to an empty arena (41 × 25 × 14 cm) for 20 min, allowing them to become familiar with the testing environment without any objects present. This habituation established a baseline for exploratory behavior, ensuring that novelty alone, and not stress from the environment, would drive the results during testing. 2—Training (Acquisition Phase): During the NOR test, mice were introduced to two identical objects placed in the arena and allowed to explore them freely for 10 min. This phase familiarized the mice with the objects, allowing them to interact and establish a baseline for object recognition. 3—Testing Phase (Novel Object Introduction): After 1 h, the testing phase was initiated by replacing one of the familiar objects with a novel object. Mice were allowed to explore the arena for 5 min, and their exploratory behavior was recorded. The preference index was calculated as the percentage of time spent exploring the novel object relative to the total exploration time. This process was repeated after a 24-h interval, introducing a different novel object each time. 4—Novel Object Placement (NOP) Test: For the NOP test, the procedure was similar, with one key modification. After 5 min of training with two identical objects, one of the objects was moved to a new location in the arena. Mice were reintroduced to the arena for 5 min, and their interaction time with both the old and relocated objects was recorded. The discrimination index was calculated as (time spent exploring the new place - time exploring the old place)/total exploration time, assessing spatial memory and the mouse’s ability to detect changes in object placement [31].

To investigate the relationship between behavioral data and cellular outcomes, we systematically applied machine learning techniques to predict mitophagosome and mitochondrial numbers. The dataset comprised 20 mitophagosomes and 16 mitochondrial samples, with their respective counts serving as target variables. Given the complex and non-linear nature of biological data, accurately predicting cellular dynamics using behavioral parameters requires a robust analytical framework. To address this, we evaluated 11 different machine learning algorithms, spanning both linear and non-linear models, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, ElasticNet Regression, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Regression, K-Neighbors Regression, Gaussian Process Regression, and XGBoost Regression. Each model was assessed for its suitability in predicting mitophagosome and mitochondrial numbers, considering their unique strengths in handling different data structures. Since there is no single universally optimal model for biological datasets, we implemented a custom evaluation pipeline to rigorously assess and compare the performance of all algorithms. All machine learning models were used with their default settings from the Scikit-learn (sklearn;https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library, implemented in Python.

Model validation was conducted through Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV), a robust technique particularly effective for small datasets, as it iteratively trains models on all but one data point and tests on the excluded instance. This approach minimizes bias and maximizes the generalizability of the models. To evaluate model performance, we used two widely recognized metrics: coefficient of determination (R²), which quantifies the proportion of variance explained by the model, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), which measures the average magnitude of prediction errors.

It’s important to note that only two behavioral features were used in this analysis, limiting the insights provided by the feature coefficients. Moreover, due to the distinct mechanisms employed by each algorithm for determining feature importance, a direct comparison of feature coefficients across models was not feasible. The selection of the best-performing algorithm was solely based on accuracy comparisons, and each algorithm was chosen for its specific predictive capability in different regions of the brain.

All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 17.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and graphs were drawn using GraphPad Prism 8.0.1 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Statistical analysis of behavioral performance was conducted using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Spearman’s correlation test was applied to correlate the behavioral findings obtained in the NOP and NOR tests with mitochondria and mitophagosome numbers and BCL2-family protein expression in the cortex and hippocampus of female and male 3xTg-AD mice. AllP-values are presented as two-tailed, andP< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has facilitated the large-scale and diverse identification of non-coding RNA families, including long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), microRNA (miRNA), Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) and circular RNA (circRNA)[1,2]. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of heterogeneous RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides (nt) and lacking coding potential. Since the discovery of lncRNAs in the 1990s, lncRNAs have been considered junk transcription [3,4]. In 2007, with the help of high-throughput sequencing technologies, the ENCODE project discovered many non-coding elements with biochemical functions, which significantly overlap with lncRNA [5]. In recent years, with the increase in lncRNA-related research and a deeper understanding of physiological and pathological processes, studies have shown that lncRNAs have coding potential [6,7]. An open reading frame (ORF) generally refers to the nucleotide region between the start codon and the stop codon, and ORFs shorter than 300 codons are referred to as short open reading frames (sORFs) [8]. Increasing evidence suggests that lncRNAs contain sORFs that can be translated into peptides [9,10]. Functional peptides encoded by short open reading frames (sORFs-encoded small peptides, SEPs) within lncRNAs can play a role in various functions [11], including cell signaling, morphogenic regulators, partner proteins, and so on [12]. Due to the small molecular weight of SEPs, they often are overlooked. Exploring these peptides is crucial.

Currently, many lncRNAs have been identified based on transcriptome sequence, and some databases have been developed to describe their genomic annotations [13], tissue-specific expression [14,15], cellular regulation [16], and so on. However, there is a shortage of a thorough and confirmed dataset collection on peptides encoded by lncRNA [17]. TransLnc employed six biological methods to identify SEP sequences, including m6A, IRES, whole-genome translation analysis, ribosome profiling, and mass spectrometry analysis, thereby constructing a new comprehensive resource database. In this paper, research is conducted using a new comprehensive resource database, TransLnc [17]. TransLnc currently records approximately 583,840 peptides encoded by 33,094 lncRNAs. It integrates six types of direct and indirect evidence that can prove the coding potential of lncRNAs, with 65.28% of peptides having at least one kind of evidence.

Due to the short length and small size of sORFs and SEPs, biological experiments face numerous limitations, such as time-consuming processes, low efficiency, high costs [18], etc. With the rapid development of machine learning algorithms, machine learning has played crucial roles in various aspects, including lncRNA-disease associations [19], identification of cell-penetrating peptides [20], etc. Furthermore, it can provide a powerful reference for biological experiment validation, saving a significant amount of time and cost to accelerate research. Currently, the recognition of encoded peptides based on machine learning is still in the early stages. CRITICA [21], CPC2 [22] and PhyloCSF [23] employ alignment methods to distinguish between mRNA and lncRNA, which can be used for identifying encoded peptides. However, these alignment-based methods heavily rely on pre-existing data, limiting their effectiveness. The predicted results will be directly impacted if there is a large gap between new and alignment data. Another method is non-alignment-based methods, which solely rely on the sequence’s intrinsic information. In comparison to alignment-based methods, this method is more flexible and versatile. MiPepid is a tool specifically designed to identify peptides, created by Zhuet al.[24] with logistic regression (LR) model by 4-mer features. In comparison to tools like CPC [25], CPC2 [22] and CPAT [26], MiPepid not only exhibits better performance in predicting traditional-sized proteins but also demonstrates excellent performance in the identification of peptides. Tonget al.[27] developed a feature engineering tool called CPPred, utilizing eight RNA-sequence-based and protein-sequence-based features collected from CPAT and CPC2. CPPred incorporated CTD features and employed SVM for the identification of coding RNA. Furthermore, CPPred effectively discriminates between coding RNA and non-coding RNA with lengths less than 303 nt. Besides, Zhanget al.[28] proposed DeepCPP model, which utilized the CPPred dataset to extract and combine different sequence compositional features, and then newly introduced nucleotide bias descriptors with the mDS feature selection method to filter the contributive features into a CNN model. Additionally, CPE-SLDI [29] is the first method to address the class imbalance issue by employing an oversampling strategy. This strategy helps improve the performance in identifying sORFs.

However, these methods have not explicitly focused on identifying sORFs within lncRNAs. There are differences in the length and codon composition of sORFs belonging to different RNAs [30]. Additionally, due to the shorter growth cycles of plants, extracting sORFs encoded peptides from plant gene sequences is less challenging than from animal gene sequences. Therefore, Zhaoet al. [31] proposed a new method for sORF identification in plants named sORFplnc, which utilized features such as Hexamer scores and a resampling strategy on imbalanced plant datasets. Chenet al. [18] incorporated sORF-encoded peptides from plants into the dataset for identification and employed a novel MCSEN model for feature extraction and utilized PCA dimensionality reduction to develop a new method for sORFs and SEPs identification, named sORFpred. However, machine learning relies on data to make decisions, and it is crucial to consider the variations in training data when applying these techniques. While there are differences between animal and plant data, it is critical to acknowledge that solely focusing on plant sORFs may offer limited animal insights. Therefore, a machine-learning model must be constructed to identify peptides translated from animal lncRNA.

Many computational methods have been proposed, but they still face limitations in predicting SEPs. 1) Datasets: In previous studies, nucleotide sequences of sORF are used to construct encoding features, such as CPPred, CPAT, CPC2, sORFplnc and DeepCPP. But these encoding methods lack peptide information, which can result in less accurate predictions of sORF. The sORFpred method constructed datasets from plant data for nucleotide and amino acid sequences. However, there are differences between plant and animal data, which make the prediction of sORFpred in animal sORFs and SEPs only as a reference. In brief, the datasets utilized by these methods are singular and cannot fundamentally describe the characteristics of SEPs. Moreover, the authenticity of these datasets needs further verification. 2) Features: for feature extraction, the alignment-based feature relies on the inherent data and lacks a deep exploration of the feature information in the sequence data. In non-alignment-based methods, most methods utilize traditional feature encoding methods to extract features from either amino acids or nucleotides, such as MiPepid, CPE-SLDI, DeepCPP and sORFplnc. For SEPs sequences, which differ from traditional peptide sequences, the information in these short peptide sequences requires a more in-depth exploration. Although CPPred and sORFpred simultaneously encode features from amino acid and nucleotide perspectives, these methods overlook the structural representation information of proteins. In brief, most existing computational methods predominantly utilize traditional encoding methods to extract features from either amino acid or nucleotide sequences, which results in inadequate research and analysis for recognizing sORFs and SEPs. 3) Models: In previous model constructions, single models are used to process feature encodings, such as MiPepid, CPPred, DeepCPP and CPE-SLDI, but these methods cannot fully utilize the advantages of the extracted feature information. sORFplnc and sORFpred utilized stacking machine learning models, but the predictive results of these methods lack effective interpretability. Therefore, the current models in these methods do not exhibit satisfactory performance and fail to meet the requirements to predict SEPs.

Given these limitations, in this study, we conducted research on an experimentally validated dataset called TransLnc and proposed a new computational method, SORFPP. The TransLnc dataset includes sequence data for SEP and sORF from three species, including human, mouse and rat. For feature construction, we conducted feature extraction methods from multiple perspectives to capture the relationship between sORFs and encoded peptides. SORFPP fused traditional features from nucleotide and amino acid sequences and fed them into a machine-learning model. To enhance the features of SEP, SORFPP selected the ESM-2 model for protein sequence feature extraction. ESM-2 extracted protein representation information is input into a deep learning model. The construction process of the SORFPP model can be outlined in the following steps: 1) Obtaining and preprocessing the sORF and SEP datasets from TransLnc; 2) Encoding the nucleotide sequences of sORFs by four traditional encoding methods including 3-mer, 4-mer, Fickett and CTD; 3) Encoding the amino acid sequences of SEPs by six traditional encoding methods including AAC, APAAC, QSOrder, PAAC, 2-mer and 4-mer; 4) Combining the traditional feature encoding of nucleotides with the traditional feature encoding of amino acids to obtain fused features; 5) Using a protein language model ESM-2 model to obtain transformer-enhanced feature embeddings of SEPs; 6) Fusing machine learning and deep learning models using an ensemble learning framework to build the SORFPP model; 7) In the model performance assessment, evaluate the SORFPP performance by using seven metrics, including sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), accuracy (ACC), precision, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC).Fig 1provides an illustration of the comprehensive workflow for SORFPP.



1) Collect, classify and organize data from the TransLnc dataset; 2) Preprocess the organized dataset using CD-HIT and Blast methods to obtain the final experimental dataset; 3) Employ three traditional encoding methods, k-mer, Fickett Score and CTD, for nucleotide sequences; 4) Utilize five traditional encoding methods, k-mer, AAC, QSOrder, PAAC and APAAC, for amino acid sequences; 5) Generate transformer-enhanced feature embeddings for amino acid sequences using the ESM-2 protein language model; 6) Combine and input traditional encoding features of amino acids and nucleotides into the CatBoost model and input ESM-2 features into the Self-Attention model. Finally, the outputs from both methods are merged and inputted into a logistic regression (LR) model for prediction. Then, comparative analysis is conducted with other methods.

In previous studies, the types of experimental data were singular, and these datasets lacked precise experimental validation. Therefore, the datasets used in these methods could affect the accuracy of the prediction results. In this paper, the dataset is sourced from a new comprehensive resource, TransLnc, which extends to both translatable lncRNAs and the immune proteome. TransLnc undergoes experimental validation, providing a more reliable foundation for the predictions made in this research [17].

TransLnc initially retrieves lncRNA sequence data for humans, mice, and rats from the GENCODE (human V32 and mouse VM23) and Ensembl databases. And then, TransLnc translates all lncRNA sequences into amino acid sequences using the three-frame translation method and the seqinr package in the R programming language [11,32,33]. ORF sequences that produce more than 10 amino acids will be retained. The minimum ORF length threshold is determined based on the length of known encoded peptides in lncRNA from previous studies [33,34]. Lastly, the obtained nucleotide and amino acid sequences are validated through six direct and indirect methods.

In this experiment, we initially retrieved all nucleotide and amino acid sequences from TransLnc and categorized them into five groups based on the number of supporting evidence.Table 1documents the classification results of TransLnc.Table 1presented the original data of TransLnc. TransLnc identified SEP sequences using biological methods. The “Evidence” column inTable 1indicated the types of biological methods employed. Sequences supported by 1–4 types of evidence are considered positive samples, and sequences lacking any evidence are treated as negative samples. Additionally, we utilized the open-source program CD-HIT [35] with an 80% threshold to eliminate redundant data from the peptide sequence dataset. As a result of the amino acid and nucleotide sequences in TransLnc maintaining a one-to-one correspondence, we filtered out the corresponding nucleotide sequences based on the deduplicated peptide dataset.

Moreover, due to the high similarity in the initially screened samples, we employed the Blast [36] method. Initially, positive samples screened using the CD-HIT method were used to create a database, and then the negative samples were compared with the positive sample database. True positive and negative samples were selected using a threshold E-value of 10. Furthermore, to ensure data balance, we randomly selected data from the positive and negative samples screened using the Blast method at a 1:1 ratio, forming the positive and negative samples used in this paper. Detailed results for the three datasets can be found inTable 2.

In previous studies, the alignment-based feature relies on the inherent data and lacks a deep exploration of the feature information in the sequence data. In non-alignment-based methods, most methods utilize traditional feature encoding methods to extract features from amino acids or nucleotides, such as MiPepid, CPE-SLDI, DeepCPP and sORFplnc. SEPs sequences differ from traditional peptide sequences.Thus, the information in SEP sequences requires a more in-depth exploration. Although CPPred and sORFpred simultaneously encode features from amino acid and nucleotide perspectives, these methods lack prior knowledge representation of proteins. In brief, most existing computational methods predominantly utilize traditional encoding methods to extract features from amino acid or nucleotide sequences, which results in inadequate feature encoding and feature selection for recognizing sORFs and SEPs.

Therefore, to more accurately distinguish whether sORFs-encoded peptides (SEPs) arebiological activity, this paper employs a multi-perspective feature extraction method to mine SEPs sequence information. Feature fusion is the process of combining data from several contexts into a single entity that can enhance discriminative information and improves the performance of a computational model [37]. On the basis of traditional amino acid feature encoding methods, nucleotide-level sequence features are incorporated. Nucleotide feature extraction methods included 3-mer, 4-mer, Fickett and CTD. Amino acid feature extraction methods included AAC, APAAC, QSOrder, PAAC, 2-mer and 4-mer. Furthermore, to extensively explore the sequence information of SEPs, we utilized the Protein Language Model (PLM) ESM-2 model for feature extraction. This section will detail the advantages of each feature extraction method.

This paper evaluated computational tools for identifying lncRNAs proposed by Zhenget al.[38] to gain a deeper understanding and investigate nucleotide-related features.

(1) K-mer Features of sORFs Sequence

The csORF-finder model proposed by Zhanget al.[39], employed k-mer features to process nucleotide sequences. sORFs sequences consist of Adenines (As), Guanines (Gs), Cytosines (Cs), Thymines (Ts) and unknown bases (N). K-mer features were divided into four categories. Specifically, 1-mer recorded the count of each of the four bases; 2-mer recorded the frequency of occurrences of AA, AG,..., TT; 3-mer recorded the frequency of occurrences of AAA, AAG,..., TTT; 4-mer recorded the frequency of occurrences of AAAA, AAAG,..., TTTT. In this study, SORFPP utilized 3-mer and 4-mer for sequence computation. The 3-mer and 4-mer features were combined into a 750-dimensional vector (53+54=750) [40].

(2) Fickett TESTCODE Score

CPAT model proposed by Wanget al. [26] to distinguish coding RNA and non-coding RNA by the Fickett score feature. The Fickett score was a simple linguistic feature that distinguished protein-coding RNA from non-coding RNA based on a combination of nucleotide composition and bias in codon usage. The Fickett score was obtained by calculating four positional and four composition values (nucleotide content) in the nucleotide sequence. The positional values represented the relative preferences of each base at one codon position compared to another. For example, the positional value of A(Apos) is calculated as shown in formula (1):

The calculation methods for the positional values of C, G and T were the same as in formula (1). In the calculation process, we determined the composition ratio of each base. These eight composition ratio values were transformed into encoding probabilities (p). Each probability was multiplied by the corresponding base’s weight (w), where the weight values reflected the proportion of time each parameter whether the sequence was encoding or non-coding. SORFPP used Fickett Score to encode a nucleotide sequence to a 1-dimensional vector. The calculation of the Fickett score was shown in formula (2):

(3) Composition/Transition/Distribution (CTD)

The Composition Transition Distribution (CTD) features represented global descriptors of transcriptional sequences, including nucleotide composition values, nucleotide transition values and nucleotide distribution values. Originally, the CTD features were used to predict protein folding categories. In 2019, the CPPred model proposed by Tonget al.[27] was the first to use CTD features to extract nucleotide sequence information. The CTD features were employed to represent the structural information of sORFs.

The 30 dimensions of CTD features was composed of composition, transition and distribution values. A nucleotide’s composition value (C) was the quantity of the selected nucleotide divided by the total number of nucleotides. A nucleotide’s transition value (T) represented the percentage frequency of transitions between the four nucleotides in adjacent positions. A nucleotide’s distribution value (D) was calculated based on the sequence length, determining its occurrence at five corresponding positions: the first, 25%, 50%, 75% and the last positions.

For example, consider an sORF sequence: ATGGATCCTAGAACCTGTTCTAG-AAGGAGACGC, which contained 10 Adenines (As), 7 Thymines (Ts), 9 Guanines (Gs) and 7 Cytosines (Cs). Then, the corresponding composition values were calculated as follows: 10/33=0.303 for As, 7/33=0.212 for Ts, 9/33=0.272 for Gs and 7/33=0.212 for Cs. When calculating transition values, we consider the adjacent nucleotides (AT, AC, AG, TG, TC and GC) to determine the percentage frequency of transitions. GC represents the frequency of G and C being adjacent or C and G being adjacent. Therefore, the transition values were calculated as follows: AT=4/32=0.125, AC=2/32=0.062, AG=9/32=0.281, TG=2/32=0.062, TC=4/32=0.125, GC=2/32=0.062. Distribution values were computed based on the positions of the first, 25%, 50%, 75% and last positions for each sequence. The five positions corresponding to As were the 1st, 5th, 13th, 24th and 30th. Thus, the distribution values for As are 1/33=0.03, 5/33=0.151, 13/33=0.393, 24/33=0.727 and 30/33=0.909. Similarly, the distribution values for Ts, Gs and Cs are as follows: 0.061, 0.061, 0.273, 0.545, 0.636, 0.09, 0.121, 0.515, 0.788, 0.969, 0.212, 0.212, 0.424, 0.606 and 1. The 20 features were represented by using A0 to A4, T0 to T4, G0 to G4, and C0 to C4[41]. In this study, we used CTD to encode a nucleotide sequence to a 30-dimensional vector.

This section approaches feature selection from traditional and deep feature encoding methods. Traditional amino acid feature encoding was primarily selected from the iFeature proposed by Chenet al. [42]. For deep feature encoding, SORFPP chose the ESM-2 model [43,44] to mine the prior knowledge representational information of sORFs encoded peptides (SEPs) at a deeper level.

(1) Traditional Features

a. Amino Acid Composition (AAC)

AAC calculated the frequency of each amino acid type in a protein or peptide sequence. The frequency calculation for all 20 natural amino acids (ACDEFGH-IKLMNPQRSTVWY) was shown in Formula (3):

WhereN(t)was the count of amino acids in class t, and N was the length of the protein or peptide sequence [42]. In this study, we used AAC to encode an amino acid sequence to a 20-dimensional vector.

b. Amphiphilic Pseudo Amino Acid Composition (APAAC)

Unlike traditional AAC, APAAC incorporated the biophysical properties of amino acids, particularly hydrophilicity (PHI) and hydrophobicity (PH). Therefore, the APAAC method was employed to capture more SEP sequence information [45]. The 20 naturally amino acids possessed PHI and PH values that indicated its interaction with water molecules. The PH values spanned from 0 (the least hydrophobic) to 1 (the most hydrophobic), and the PHI values ranged from -1 (the least hydrophilic) to 1 (the most hydrophilic).

The APAAC commences by ascertaining the amino acid composition of the protein sequence and grouping the amino acids into hydrophilic and hydrophobic categories. APAAC calculated the PHI and PH scores for every amino acid in the protein sequence. APAAC was constructed by taking into account the PHI and PH values of adjacent amino acids within a predefined window, centered around a specific position in the SEP sequence. And then, the APAAC feature vector was built by combining each amino acid makeup, PHI and PH scores in the SEP sequence. In all, the amino acid makeup and location-specific attributes of SEP sequences could be obtained by using APAAC encoding method. In this study, we used APAAC to encode an amino acid sequence to a 26-dimensional vector.

c. Quasi-sequence-order (QSOrder)

QSOrder was a feature representation method that describes protein sequences by considering the sequence spacing information between amino acids in the protein sequence. Unlike AAC, QSOrder considered the relationships between adjacent amino acid pairs by defining a series of weights to represent their interactions. Therefore, utilizing QSOrder features better captured the local structural information of protein sequences. This study utilized the encoding characteristics of QSOrder. SEP sequence features were encoded by QSOrder [42], which transformed the amino acid sequence into a vector symbolising residue. Formula (4) defined a QSOrder descriptor for every amino acid type.

Here,Nrthe standard conversion frequency of amino acids in class r was represented, and a fixed weighting factorwof 0.05 was employed. Formula (5) defined the coupling number of the dth-order sequence.

Formula (5), an entry in a specific distance matrix was representeddi,i+d. The default value fornlagwas 30, andLrepresented SEP sequences length. In this study, we used QSOrder to encode an amino acid sequence to a 46-dimensional vector.

d. Pseudo-Amino Acid Composition (PAAC)

Chouet al. [49] proposed two features called PAAC and APAAC to address the problem of potential sequence information loss. Among them, the PAAC feature encoding method considered the frequency of each amino acid and the influence of sequence order on the amino acid sequence. The calculation method was shown in Formula (6):

Here,θirepresented the number of factors related to sequence order,Piwas the property value of thei-thamino acid, andNpwas the number of attributes, andNiwas the appearance of thei-thamino acid andωwas a parameter set to 0.05 [46]. In this study, we used PAAC to encode an amino acid sequence to a 23-dimensional vector.

e. K-mer Features of Peptide Sequence

In this paper, k-mer feature encoding was applied to analyze the occurrence frequencies of dipeptides, tripeptides and tetrapeptides in SEP sequences to comprehensively describe the feature information related to the amino acid sequence. In this k-mer method, the amino acid sequence was divided into contiguous subsequences of length k (where k=2,3,4) and then the frequency of each subsequence appearing in the overall sequence was calculated. Through experimental comparisons, 2-mer and 4-mer were ultimately selected for sequence calculations. The calculation method was shown in Formula (7):

Here,f(k)represented the frequency of occurrence of subsequences of lengthk, andcount(k)denoted the frequency of the subsequence appearing in the sequence, andlength(seq)represented the length of the overall sequence. The termk−1at the end was included to avoid calculating an incomplete subsequence at the sequence’s endpoint. In this study, we used k-mer to encode an amino acid sequence to an 841-dimensional vector.

(2) Pre-trained ESM-2 embedding feature

Protein Language Models (PLMs) have emerged as crucial tools for extracting protein-related features. For instance, models like ProtTrans, ESM-1 and ESM-2 have been trained on sequences from the UniRef protein sequence database using masked language modeling objectives. These models were specifically designed for protein feature extraction and enable further exploration of relevant features encoded within peptides.

The Evolutionary Scale Modeling (ESM)[44] protein language model is a method that utilizes deep learning techniques to predict protein structure and function by training an autoregressive neural network on a large-scale protein sequence database and learning the evolutionary patterns of proteins and the relationship between sequence-structure-function. ESM-2 can generate a corresponding hidden vector for a given protein sequence to represent its structural and functional features. ESM is a powerful and versatile protein language model and provides a new perspective and tools for protein science. ESM-2 is pre-trained using the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) task. Its loss function is given by:

Here, X represents the training dataset, where a particular symbol denotes amino acid residues at multiple positions on each sample[Mask]. In this study, we used ESM-2 to encode an amino acid sequence to a 1280-dimensional vector.

In previous model constructions, single models were used to process feature encodings, such as MiPepid, CPPred, DeepCPP and CPE-SLDI, but these methods could not fully utilize the advantages of the extracted feature information. sORFplnc and sORFpred utilized stacking machine learning models, but the predictive results of these methods lack effective interpretability, such as model evaluation. Therefore, the current models in these methods do not exhibit satisfactory performance. There is room for improvement through the characteristics of machine learning and deep learning model architectures.

In the introduction of the feature section, traditional encoding methods generated numerous zero-valued features. Due to both the amino acid and nucleotide utilize k-mer and other frequency calculation methods, which results in the formation of sparse matrices and leads to suboptimal performance when fed into deep learning models. Moreover, ESM-2 is a Transformer-based protein language model, which can learn the evolutionary patterns of proteins and the relationships between sequence, structure and function from extensive protein sequence data. The highly informative features generated by ESM-2 offer a richer and in-depth inputting feature. Given this wealth of feature information, deep learning models can effectively capture the complex relationships among these features.

In the model selection section, a multi-perspective fusion model method was adopted to explore the advantages of the machine and deep learning models. This paper independently input both types of features into machine learning and deep learning models to get separate prediction results. Finally, employing an ensemble learning framework, we combined the results generated by the machine learning and deep learning models to build a learning model to achieve more accurate predictions.

Categorical Boosting (CatBoost)

In this research, our task was to classify and predict the functional peptides encoded by sORFs within lncRNA. Gradient Boosting is an enhancement algorithm used for both regression and classification tasks, such as CatBoost with two advantages over other machine learning models: 1) handling categorical features, eliminating the need for additional feature engineering before training the model; 2) prediction offset handling, reducing model overfitting and improving prediction performance.

The CatBoost model was a gradient-boosting decision tree method introduced by Prokhorenkova et al. in 2017[47]. CatBoost is a GBDT framework, which employed symmetric decision trees to process the missing and sparse data and capture non-zero features. CatBoost adapted the greedy TS method by incorporating a prior term and assigning weighting factors, as shown in Formula (9):

In Formula (9), Prokhorenkovaet al. definepas a prior, typically set to the mean value of the dataset labels,αusually defined as a parameter greater than 0 to ensure the effectiveness ofxikwhen∑j=1p−1[xσj,k=xσp,k]is 0.

Logistic Regression (LR)

In this paper, logistic regression (LR) as the final decision-layer model utilizes the linear combination feature. The deep features extracted through the ESM-2 model encompass deeper semantic information, and the LR model can find effective decision boundaries in effective feature spaces. Moreover, features extracted by traditional encoding methods exhibit collaborative relationships. The logistic regression model can learn these relationships and effectively utilize the information from traditional features.

Due to the simplicity and efficiency of LR, LR is often a favorable choice as the final output layer for ensemble model. The core of the logistic regression model is the S-shaped logistic function for estimating probabilities, as shown in Formula (10):

In Formula (10),PY=1|Xrepresents the probability of the amino acid sequence.β0,β1,...,βkcomprised model parameters, including the intercept termβ0and coefficientsβ1toβkfor each feature.X1,X2,...,Xkrepresented the features of the amino acid sequence.

3. Self-attention Model

In the feature extraction phase, we employed the ESM-2 model for in-depth information mining of amino acid sequences. During the pre-training process of ESM-2, a Self-attention mechanism is employed to extract attention maps. Symmetrization and Average Product Correction (APC) are applied to transform the attention maps into the desired format for regression tasks. Thus, to better capture the interactive information among the sequences of SEPs, SORFPP incorporated a self-attention model into the deep learning architecture constructed in this paper [48]. The self-attention mechanism enables the model to capture long-term dependencies between information in the SEPs and selectively assign higher weights to important SEPs sequence information and assign lower weights to other information. Three attention vectors,Q,KandV, are represented:

Here, the query matrix was denotedQ, the key matrix was representedK, the value matrix was representedV, andUq,UkandUvare parameter matrices. The attention weights corresponding to each element are computed using the softmax function. The representation of the attention matrix is given by Formula (12):

Here,Trepresents the attention matrix,dkdenotes the scaling factor and softmax denotes a column normalization function.

Construction of SORFPP

This paper presents a computational framework called SORFPP to solve the prediction of SEP. SORFPP used a validated experimental dataset named TransLnc to conduct experiments, which predicted the activity of SEPs by integrating multi-perspective features and models. SORFPP consists of three components: 1) Traditional fusion features of amino acid and nucleotide were processed by using the CatBoost model; 2) ESM-2 model extracts Prior knowledge representation information from SEP sequences. And then, this information was processed by using the self-attention model; 3) The output of CatBoost and self-attention model were combined and processed by using the linear combination feature of a logistic regression model.

For traditional amino acid encoding methods, the feature methods that calculate sequence composition and base frequency made a positive contribution to predicting SEPs. Due to SEPs were obtained through the translation of sORFs. Therefore, this study obtained a traditional fusion feature that combines amino acid and nucleotide perspectives by integrating the nucleotide-level base frequency values with amino acid feature values. The dimension of this fused feature was 1737 (V1737), including AAC (VAAC), APAAC (VAP), PAAC (VP), QSOrder (VQS), CTD (VCTD), Fickett score (VFick), k-mer of amino acid (Vk) and k-mer of nucleotide (Vk’). And then, the traditional fused feature (V1737) will input the CatBoost model.

The CatBoost model used the logarithmic loss function to predict SEPs. Here,ytruerepresented true label, andypredrepresented probability of prediction. In this study, the depth of trees was set 7 in the CatBoost model. Theleafirepresented i-th tree values. ML_Output represented the probability that a sample belongs to the positive sample when inputting feature isV1737.

This study used ESM-2 to encode an amino acid sequence to a 1280-dimensional vector to mine the prior knowledge representational information of SEPs. And then, the ESM features (V1280) will input self-attention model. TheV1280was transformed into vectors of Query (Q), Key (K) and Value (V). Thedkwas set 1280 in the self-attention model. DL_Output was a probability distribution, which represents the importance of each input element.

Combine ML_Output and DL_Output as input (PMD) for the logistic regression model.Zrepresented the result of the linear combination ofPMDand the weight coefficients (Wi). Here,Brepresented the model intercept, and n represented the number of samples. And then,Zwas transformed into probability of prediction SEPs by using the sigmoid function. Finally, IfPwas greater than 0.5, sample was classified as SEPs. IfPwas less than 0.5, sample was classified as not SEPs.

The specific steps are illustrated inFig 2.



A) Machine Learning: Ten encoding methods for nucleotide and amino acid sequences are compared and selected through a multi-perspective method. Subsequently, these ten feature encodings are fused and input into the CatBoost model to obtain machine learning outputs. B) Deep Learning: Coding peptide sequences are input into the protein language model ESM-2. These features are input into the Self-Attention model to obtain deep learning outputs. C) Ensemble Learning: The outputs from machine learning and deep learning are combined and input into the logistic regression model, serving as the final model to produce prediction results.

Evaluation metrics were numerical indicators of model performance. Predicting whether the SEPs were biologically active was a binary classification problem, so we used binary classification metrics to assess the model’s effectiveness. In this paper, we employ several commonly used metrics to evaluate SORFPP, such as Accuracy (ACC), Precision (PRE), F1 Score, Area under the ROC curve (AUC), Sensitivity (SN), Specificity (SP) and Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC). The false positive and true positive rates were represented FPR and TPR. The ROC curve had the FPR on the horizontal axis and the TPR on the vertical axis. The formulas are as follows:

The TP represented the count of instances where the predicted and actual values were SEPs, TN represented the count where both the predicted and actual values were not SEPs and FP represented the count where the predicted value is SEPs, but the actual value was not SEPs. FN represented the count where the predicted value was not SEPs, but the actual value was SEPs.

Selecting the appropriate feature extraction methods was crucial and helpful to build predictive model. Insufficient comparison of encoding features may make the advantage of each feature ambiguous. Therefore, this study selected feature methods that were helpful for predicting SEPs by conducting feature extraction from multiple perspectives. This section presented the results of feature comparison and selection.

For the traditional feature extraction of the amino acid sequence, 28 traditional amino acid features were compared, including k-mer (k=2, 3, 4), QSOrder, PAAC, AAC, APAAC, DPC, CKSAAP, EAAC, BLOSUM62, BINARY, ZSCALE, GTPC, DDE, CTDD, CKSAAGP, EGAAC, CTDC, CTriad, GDPC, KSCTriad, CTDT, Geary, Moran, GAAC, NMBroto and SOCNumber [42]. After a comprehensive comparison, six feature encoding methods showed excellent, including 2-mer, 4-mer, QSOrder, PAAC, AAC and APAAC. And then, these six features of amino acid were combined into a fused amino acid feature (Amino acid fused feature, AA Feature).

For the traditional feature extraction of the nucleotide sequence, 17 traditional feature encoding methods were compared, including k-mer (k=2, 3, 4), CTD, Fickett, Hexamer, Word2vec, GC content (GC, GC2, GC3), BINARY, EIIP, Entroy, SNCP, z_curve, SPCP and Cumulative Skew. After the comparison, four encoding methods demonstrated well, including 3-mer, 4-mer, CTD and Fickett. Besides, these four features of nucleotide were merged into a fused nucleotide feature (Nucleotide fused feature, NT Feature). Histograms inFig 3illustrated the comparison the AA Feature with amino acid traditional features through three datasets. For NT feature,Fig 3also showed the comparison with nucleotide traditional features by the same way. Detailed comparative results for the three datasets can be found inTable 3andTable 4.

For accuracy (ACC), precision (PRE), area under the curve (AUC), Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC), F1 score, sensitivity (SN) and specificity (SP), the comparison results were listed inTable 3. Specifically, in the human amino acid dataset, AA Feature exhibited better performance in comparison with individual features, with improvement of ACC by 0.4%–1.2%, PRE by 0.2%–1.9%, AUC by 0.5%–1.8%, MCC by 0.3%–1.7%, F1 by 0.2%–1.3%, SN by 0.6%–1.5% and SP by 0.2%–0.9%. Moreover, the top six individual features with the higher performance in the mouse and rat amino acid datasets were the same as in the human amino acid dataset. Therefore, these top six features were merged into fused features. In the mouse amino acid dataset, the results of AA Feature exhibited superiority in comparison with individual features, with enhancement of ACC by 0.7%–1.4%, PRE by 0.2%–2.2%, AUC by 0.2%–1.1%, MCC by 1.2%–2.7%, F1 by 0.5%–1.5%, SN by 0.3%–4.6% and SP by 0.5%–3%. In the rat amino acid dataset, the AA Feature illustrated higher evaluation metrics in comparison with individual features, with advancement of ACC by 0.8%–2.1%, PRE by 0.1%–3.9%, AUC by 0.5%–1.7%, MCC by 0.2%–3.4%, F1 by 0.2%–2.4%, SN by 0.2%–1.2% and SP by 0.1%–4.4%.

The comparison results of the encoding feature methods of nucleotide sequence were presented inTable 4. In the human nucleotide dataset, NT feature showed superiority in comparison with individual features, with advancement of ACC by 0.6%–2.7%, PRE by 0.6%–4.2%, AUC by 0.1%–2.2%, MCC by 1.3%–5.6%, F1 by 0.6%–2.5%, SN by 0.4%–2.2% and SP by 0.5%–4%. Moreover, the top four individual features with the better performance in the mouse and rat nucleotide datasets were the same as in the human nucleotide dataset. Therefore, these four features were combined into fused feature. In the mouse nucleotide dataset, the results of NT Feature illustrated higher evaluation metrics in comparison with individual features, with improvement of ACC by 1.2%–4.4%, PRE by 0.4%–3%, AUC by 0.8%–4.5%, MCC by 0.5%–5%, F1 by 0.4%–2.9%, SN by 0.5%–2.8% and SP by 0.1%–2.3%. In the rat nucleotide dataset, the results of NT Feature exhibited superior performance in comparison with individual features, with enhancement of ACC by 1.2%–3.2%, PRE by 0.4%–2.4%, AUC by 0.2%–3.6%, MCC by 0.5%–4.7%, F1 by 0.2%–4.3%, SN by 0.5%–8.3% and SP by 0.3%–2.8%.

SEP sequences had lesser molecular weights in comparison with traditional peptide sequences. Therefore, a multi-perspective feature extraction method was required to enrich SEP sequence information. For traditional feature encoding methods, the AA Feature and NT Feature were combined into the AN Feature. Six traditional amino acid encoding methods were selected, including 2-mer, 4-mer, QSOrder, PAAC, AAC and APAAC. Four traditional nucleotide encoding methods were selected, including 3-mer, 4-mer, CTD and Fickett. And then, the ten feature encoding methods from amino acid and nucleotide were integrated to construct a fused feature that combined the characteristics of amino acids and nucleotides (Amino Acids-Nucleotides fused feature, AN Feature).

The protein language model ESM-2 for feature extraction on the peptide sequence was employed. ESM-2 was a pre-trained model trained on a large dataset through unsupervised learning, which can uncover latent feature of a peptide through prior knowledges. Therefore, the extraction method performance of the AN feature, AA feature, NT feature and ESM feature were compared. In the histogram ofFig 4, the red bar represented the AN feature and demonstrated superior performance in evaluation metrics, such as ACC, AUC, F1 and MCC. The blue bars for the ESM feature were slightly lower than the green bar for the AA Feature and higher than the orange bar for the NT Feature. Additionally, ROC curves inFig 4were plotted to provide a comprehensive comparison of the four features.



Moreover, scatter plots inFig 5were generated by utilizing t-SNE method to better illustrate the performance of AN feature, AA feature and NT feature.Fig 5illustrated the scatter distributions of the AN Feature in the top row, the AA Feature in the middle row and the NT Feature in the bottom row. InFig 5, the first-row scatter plots represented the AN Feature and exhibited a more pronounced dispersion. Consequently, the AN Feature had a better performance for prediction SEPs.



In addition, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) was applied to elucidate the importance of the fused features in the model [49]. SHAP provides a way to quantify the contribution of each feature to the model prediction. This holds significant reference value for analyzing the prediction mechanisms of complex models, particularly in our research, where understanding the impact of each feature on the model output is a crucial step [50].

The Left Column ofFig 6displayed the SHAP value distribution for the top 20 features, where red dots represented positive correlation and blue dots represented negative correlation. The larger the dot size, the more significant the feature’s impact on the model. Through this graph, we observe that the top 20 features contain both features from contrastive learning and features from pre-trained models. The Right Column ofFig 6provided the average SHAP values of the top 20 features through a bar chart. The length of each bar represented the absolute magnitude of the average SHAP value of the corresponding feature, which intuitively reflected the average impact of each feature on the model output.



We selected features by taking the absolute average of SHAP values and tried other different thresholds. The results showed that the top 20 features significantly impact model performance, but other features also play important roles in specific situations. These results highlight the necessity of considering different types of features comprehensively rather than relying solely on a single feature encoding method. The combination of Amino Acids and Nucleotides features provided a wider range of information for protein sequence characterization than a single-feature encoding algorithm, thus demonstrating superior predictive performance.

The performance of four feature extraction methods was listed by seven evaluation metrics inTable 5. In detail, in the human dataset, the AN feature showed optimized performance in comparison with the AA Feature, NT Feature and ESM Feature, with improvement of ACC by 2.8%–3.7%, AUC by 5.1%–5.9%, MCC by 4.8%–6.9% and F1 by 1.4%–5.1%. In the mouse dataset, the AN feature exhibited superiority in comparison with the other three feature methods, with enhancement of ACC by 3%–5%, AUC by 4.1%–7.9%, MCC by 4.8%–9.6% and F1 by 1.1%–7.7%. In the rat dataset, the AN feature demonstrated higher evaluation metrics in comparison with the other three methods, with advancement of ACC by 5%–9.8%, AUC by 5.8%–9.9%, MCC by 7.5%–17.9% and F1 by 1.7%–12.4%.

Note: Amino Acids-Nucleotides fused feature (AN Feature), Amino acid fused feature (AA Feature), Nucleotide fused feature (NT Feature)

Moreover, the performance of ESM Feature was demonstrated to be better than NT features by comparing the evaluation metrics results inTable 5. ESM Feature showed relatively minor differences in various evaluation metrics with comparison of AA Feature. But the precision metric of ESM Feature exhibited superiority in comparison with AA Feature. Therefore, the ESM-2 model was chosen to mine the prior knowledge representational information of SEPs.

The AN Feature and ESM Feature were selected after the feature comparison section. The sequence composition calculation and k-mer feature encoding methods were employed in the AN Feature, which caused some sequences to have feature values of 0 leading to sparse matrices. Preprocessing methods needed to be adopted to input sparse matrix features for input of deep learning model, such as L1 regularization (Lasso) [51], Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) [52] and Sparse Matrix Factorization [53]. But the selected feature may have divergent impacts due to discrepancies in preprocessing methods. However, the ESM Feature showed good performance in section 3.1. ESM-2 was employed to overcome the challenges of processing sparse features in deep learning models. Therefore, machine learning models were utilized to process AN Feature.

A corresponding hidden vector for a given protein sequence was generated by using ESM-2 to represent protein sequence structural and functional features. Therefore, ESM-2 model offered more in-depth information of SEPs. Due to the intricate correlations within the ESM Feature, deep learning models were employed to capture the prior knowledge representational information of SEPs.

Therefore, model comparison was conducted from multi-perspective methods. This section will detail the methods and results of model selection.

For the performance of machine learning models with AN Feature, eight individual machine learning models were compared, including CatBoost, Random Forest (RF), LightGBM (LGBM), GBDT, Logistic Regression (LR), XGBoost, SVM and Decision Tree (DT). Through validation on three datasets, three models demonstrated excellent, including CatBoost, Random Forest and GBDT. And then, the stacking stratrgy was employed to fuse three models. These stacking models included combination Random Forest, CatBoost and GBDT (RCG), blend GBDT and CatBoost (GC), compound Random Forest and CatBoost (RC); and integration Random Forest and GBDT(RG). The specific comparative results can be found inFig 7andTable 6.

The red bars in the histogram ofFig 7represented the CatBoost model and showed better performance in terms of ACC and MCC evaluation metrics. The blue curves in the ROC curve ofFig 7symbolized the area under the curve (AUC) of the CatBoost model. The AUC of the CatBoost model was slightly lower than the GBDT model on the human AN Feature by 0.01% and on the mouse AN Feature by 0.15%. But the CatBoost model had shown superiority in comparison with other individual models and the four stacked models. Besides, the CatBoost model with AN Feature performed get best performance on the rat dataset.

The comparison results of machine learning models were presented inTable 6. Specifically, for the human AN Feature, the CatBoost model showed better performance on three evaluation metrics in comparison with other models, with advancement of ACC by 0.1%–4%, MCC by 0.3%–7.7% and F1 score by 0.1%–4.9%. For the mouse AN Feature, the CatBoost model exhibited superiority on three evaluation metrics in comparison with other models, with improvement of ACC by 0.1%–4.9%, MCC by 0.1%–9.7% and Precision by 0.2%–5.1%. For the rat AN Feature, the CatBoost model shown optimized performance on four evaluation metrics in comparison with other models, with enhancement of ACC by 0.5%–7.9%, MCC by 0.3%–15.9%, AUC by 0.5%–8.7% and F1 score by 0.7%–8.3%. The CatBoost model had been proven to have outstanding performance by comparing the evaluation metrics within three datasets. Therefore, the CatBoost model was chosen to process the AN Feature.

For the performance of deep learning models with ESM Feature, 11 individual deep learning models were compared, including LSTM, GRU, RNN, CNN, MLP, TextCNN, BiLSTM, Self-attention (Attention), Attention_BiLSTM (ABiLSTM), Attention_BiGRU (ABiGRU) and CNN_LSTM (CLSTM). Among them, three fusion networks were detailed in Supporting information (S1 TableandS1-S3 Figs), such as ABiLSTM, ABiGRU and CLSTM. Three deep learning models performed well on human ESM Feature, like Attention, LSTM and GRU. And then, the stacking strategy was employed to combine three models. These stacking models contained fusion Attention, LSTM and GRU (ALG), compound Attention and LSTM (AL), integration Attention and GRU (AG) and combination LSTM and GRU (LG). Moreover, three deep learning models showed superiority with mouse ESM Feature and rat ESM Feature, including Attention, CNN and LSTM. Subsequently, the stacking strategy was utilized to blend three models. These stacking models incorporated mergence Attention, CNN and LSTM (ACL), composition Attention and CNN (AC), fusion Attention and LSTM (AL) and concoction CNN and LSTM (CL). The specific comparative results can be found inFig 8andTable 7.

The red bar in the histogram ofFig 8symbolized the Attention model and displayed superiority in terms of ACC and MCC evaluation metrics. The blue curve in the ROC curve ofFig 8represented the area under the curve (AUC) of the Attention model. The Attention model had exhibited better performance in comparison with other individual models and the four stacked models on all ESM Features.

The comparison results of deep learning models were shown inTable 7. Particularly, on the human ESM Feature, the Attention model exhibited superiority on three evaluation metrics in comparison with other models, with improvement of ACC by 0.1%–7.3%, MCC by 0.4%–9.6% and AUC by 0.2%–12%. On the mouse ESM Feature, the Attention model bespoke better performance on three evaluation metrics in comparison with other models, with enhancement of ACC by 0.7%–6.1%, MCC by 1%–11.4% and AUC by 0.8%–8.8%. On the rat ESM Feature, the Attention model emerged optimized performance on three evaluation metrics in comparison with other models, with advancement of ACC by 1.2%–8.5%%, MCC by 2.8%–17.3% and AUC by 1.7%–9.3%. The Attention model had demonstrated outstanding performance by comparing the evaluation metrics within three datasets. Therefore, the Attention model was selected to deal the ESM Feature.

The performance of the SORFPP was validated by comparing with state-of-the-art methods from the past five years on three different species datasets, including CPPred, Mipepid, CPE-SLDI, DeepCPP, sORFplnc and sORFpred. Here was a brief overview of the features and models of comparative methods: 1) for CPPred, to identify coding RNAs, the SVM model was employed to process the traditional fusion feature that incorporated six nucleotide features and three amino acid features. 2) for Mipepid, to predict peptide, the Logistic Regression model was employed to deal the fusion feature that combined two nucleotide features. 3) for CPE-SLDI, to identify sORF, the oversampling was used to address the issue of class imbalance. 4) for DeepCPP: to predict coding RNAs, the CNN model was utilized to dispose the filtering feature that used the mDS feature selection method. 5) for sORFplnc, to identify sORF on plant imbalanced datasets, the resampling strategy was applied to handle the combination feature. 6) for sORFpred, to identify SEPs on plant datasets, the PCA dimensionality reduction was adopted to process the feature that extracted by the novel MCSEN model. The summary of these comparative methods was listed inTable 8.

The specific results of comparing SORFPP with other predictors were shown inTable 9. Furthermore, histograms, ROC and PR curves ofFig 9were generated for a more comprehensive analysis of the SORFPP performance.



The red bar in the histogram of Fig 9 symbolized the SORFPP. The blue curve in the ROC curve of Fig 9 represented the area under the curve (AUC) of the SORFPP.

The red bar in the histogram ofFig 9symbolized the SORFPP and showed outstanding performance in evaluation metrics, such as ACC, Precision (PRE), AUC, MCC and F1 score. ROC and PR curves were plotted in the rightmost two columns ofFig 9. The blue curve in the ROC curve ofFig 9represented the area under the curve (AUC) of the SORFPP. Besides, the blue curve in the PR curve ofFig 9represented the precision-recall ratio of the SORFPP. Observation of the curve inFig 9revealed that the ROC and PR curves of SORFPP wrapped other models. Therefore, the SORFPP demonstrated higher evaluation metrics in comparison with other predictors, including CPPred, MiPepid, CPE-SLDI, DeepCPP, sORFplnc and sORFpred.

State–of–the–art predictors were proven to yield different predictions on different datasets by the analysis of the results inTable 9. SORFPP exhibited optimal performance on various datasets. Specifically, on the human dataset, the SORFPP showed better performance on five evaluation metrics in comparison with other predictors, with enhancement of ACC by 6.6%–10.6%, PRE by 0.8%–9.7%, AUC by 7.8%–10.8%, MCC by 12.4%–21% and F1 score by 8.2%–11.6%. On the mouse dataset, the SORFPP projected superiority on five evaluation metrics in comparison with other predictors, with advancement of ACC by 6.4%–11.2%, PRE by 0.7%–9.7%, AUC by 6.5%–11.7%, MCC by 12.3%–22.3% and F1 score by 7.5%–11.7%. On the rat dataset, the SORFPP bespoke optimized performance on five evaluation metrics in comparison with other predictors, with improvement of ACC by 6.1%–12.4%, PRE by 4%–11%, AUC by 5.7%–13.3%, MCC by 12.2%–24.2% and F1 score by 6.9%–15.5%.

To better demonstrate the generalizability of SORFPP, this study collected three plant datasets from sORFPred, including Arabidopsis thaliana (Ath), Glycine max (Gmax), and Physcomitrella patens (Ppatens). The performance of SORFPP was compared with sORFPred using the same plant datasets. Detailed results were presented inFig 10andTable 10.

The red bar in the histogram ofFig 10symbolized the SORFPP and showed outstanding performance in evaluation metrics, such as ACC, Precision (PRE), AUC, MCC and F1 score. ROC and PR curves were plotted in the rightmost two columns ofFig 10. The blue curve in the ROC curve ofFig 10represented the area under the curve (AUC) of the SORFPP. Besides, the blue curve in the PR curve ofFig 10represented the precision-recall ratio of the SORFPP. Observation of the curve inFig 10revealed that the ROC and PR curves of SORFPP wrapped sORFPred.

InTable 10, SORFPP demonstrated superior performance to sORFPred across all evaluation metrics on the same datasets. Specifically, on the three datasets, the SORFPP showed better performance on five evaluation metrics in comparison with sORFPred, with enhancement of ACC by 5.6%–6.4%, PRE by 6%–7.6%, AUC by 2.5%–3.9%, MCC by 9.9%–12.7% and F1 score by 5.1%–6.4%.

The prediction scores indicated the probability that the sequence was an SEP. The heatmap of the prediction scores was used to visualize the predictive capabilities of SORFPP and other predictors.Fig 11illustrated that darker colors represented SEPs and lighter colors indicated non-SEPs. SORFPP predictor was presented in the second column from the right ofFig 11. The last column displayed the true labels of the data. Inspection of the heatmap inFig 11revealed that the SORFPP showed a more distinct differentiation.



SORFPP predictor was presented in the second column. The last column displayed the true labels of the data.

For the convenience of subsequent researchers to predict SEP, the source codes of the SORFPP framework have been available on the GitHub platform. The SORFPP framework was built by using the Python programming language to ensure compatibility with multiple operating systems, such as Windows and Linux. The content is obtained at the following URL:https://github.com/OR2513/SORFPP. Additionally, a user-friendly graphical interface was developed to utilize SORFPP. The interface was made immediately accessible athttp://111.229.198.94:5000/.

Early research indicated that lncRNA sequences could not encode proteins. In recent years, the small open reading frame (sORF) in lncRNA sequence has been found to be capable of encoding peptide. This sORF-encoded peptide was known as SEP. SEP sequence had a lesser molecular weight in comparison with traditional peptide sequence, but it contained important functional structures, such as helices and folds. Besides, SEPs were frequently involved in biological processes, including cell signaling, intercellular interaction, gene expression control, and so on. However, the lack of a comprehensive lncRNA-encoded peptide database and the limitations of feature and model methods within previous predictors made predicting SEPs challenging. In addition, previous research has focused on plant datasets. Therefore, SORFPP was proposed to improve the performance of predicting SEP by combining machine learning and deep learning methods on the experimentally validated dataset TransLnc.

The contribution of SORFPP to predicting SEPs was categorized into four aspects, including dataset, feature, model and web. 1) Dataset: SORFPP addressed the issues of species monotonicity and authenticity by collecting and processing the experimentally validated dataset TransLnc. 2) Feature: SORFPP extracted feature from multiple perspectives. Integrating nucleotide-level features into traditional amino acid features had a positive effect. Furthermore, ESM-2 could capture the prior knowledge representational information of SEPs. 3) The multi-perspective fusion model computational framework was utilized to address the issue of model monotonicity. Three models were integrated to calculate probability of predicting SEP sequences, such as CatBoost, self-attention and logistic regression. 4) A user-friendly graphical interface for SORFPP was developed to facilitate subsequent research.

Currently, the lack of specifically collated databases for prediction of SEPs was a significant issue. TransLnc validated many SEP and sORF sequence data by using various biological methods. Besides, TransLnc included three species datasets, such as human, mouse and rat. SORFPP obtained a reliable dataset by collecting and processing the TransLnc dataset.

Features play an important role in predicting SEPs. SEP sequences were lesser molecular weights in comparison to traditional peptide sequences. Therefore, a multi-perspective feature extraction method was required to enrich SEP sequence information. 1) In traditional feature encoding methods, the sequence composition calculation and k-mer feature encoding methods of amino acids demonstrated better performance in comparison with other methods, including AAC, APAAC, PAAC, QSOrder, 2-mer and 4-mer. Similarly, the sequence composition calculation and k-mer feature encoding methods of nucleotides also exhibited superior performance in comparison with other methods, such as 3-mer, 4-mer, Fickett, and CTD. Therefore, the enrichment of sequence composition information has been shown to have a positive impact on the prediction of SEPs. And then, the ten feature encoding methods from amino acid and nucleotide were integrated to construct a combination feature (AN Feature). 2) Moreover, the protein language model of ESM-2 could generate a corresponding hidden vector for a given protein sequence for representing its structural and functional features. Thus, ESM-2 could capture the prior knowledge representational information of SEPs (ESM Feature). Besides, ESM-2 was employed to overcome the challenges of processing sparse features in deep learning models.

The models of the state-of-the-art methods did not exhibit satisfactory performance. Thus, SORFPP employed the multi-perspective fusion model computational framework. Due to the CatBoost model construction by using a balanced decision tree, the CatBoost model could process the missing and sparse data to capture non-zero features by splitting features. The self-attention mechanism enables the model to capture long-term dependencies between information in the SEPs and selectively assign higher weights to important SEPs sequence information and assign lower weights to other information. The logistic regression (LR) model as the final decision-layer model utilized the linear combination feature. The LR model can find effective decision boundaries in effective feature spaces for the ESM Feature. Moreover, the LR model was capable of learning and utilizing collaborative relationships within the AN Feature.

Additionally, the performance of the SORFPP was validated by comparing with state-of-the-art methods from the past five years on three different species datasets, including CPPred, Mipepid, CPE-SLDI, DeepCPP, sORFplnc and sORFpred. The SORFPP showed better performance on five evaluation metrics in comparison with other predictors, with enhancement of ACC by 6.1%–12.4%, PRE by 4%–11%, AUC by 5.7%–13.3%, MCC by 12.2%–24.2%, and F1 score by 6.9%–15.5%. For the convenience of subsequent researchers to predict SEP, a user–friendly graphical interface was developed to utilize SORFPP. The interface was made immediately accessible athttp://111.229.198.94:5000/.

SORFPP has shown better performance in predicting the biological activity of SEPs compared to other methods, but we believed this method still has certain limitations and there is room for advancement in the future.

Although the TransLnc dataset has compiled a wealth of sequence resources, sequencing technology was becoming more cost-effective, high-throughput, and versatile with its development. Fourth-generation sequencing technologies were maturing, including nanopore sequencing technology and electron microscopy, which can improve sequencing accuracy. In the future, with the construction of such databases becoming more comprehensive, we will continue to collect related datasets and supplement data samples.

Secondly, although the feature encoding methods for traditional peptide sequences were well-developed, research on encoding methods for this new type of SEP sequences was insufficient. The development of protein language models could better mine the sequence information of short peptides. For instance, newly introduced protein models like Ankh and the xTrimo Protein General Language Model (xTrimoPGLM) have demonstrated strong capabilities and broad prospects in mining hidden biological information within protein sequences. In future work, we will integrate the strengths of these models to more thoroughly mine the SEPs sequence information.

Most existing methods relied on comparative experiments to select the optimal machine learning or deep learning framework for building predictive models. Due to the vast number of machine learning and deep learning algorithms, this has become a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Moreover, deep learning frameworks usually require significant computational resources and time to train and optimize models. To address these drawbacks, automated machine learning (AutoML) packages represented a deep neural network architecture that excels in identifying model performance based on the characteristics of the input information, such as Auto-PyTorch and AutoKeras. Additionally, these tools could help simplify the model optimization process in DL model training, greatly facilitating model training and enhancing the robustness of the trained models. In future work, we plan to integrate AutoML methods into the SEPs prediction process, significantly improving the predictive efficiency of the existing framework.

Looking ahead, we will concentrate on creating more robust models, researching more effective features and improving the predictive accuracy of SEPs.

Dataset:SORFPP has created a dependable experimental dataset by compiling and analyzing the TransLnc dataset, which utilizes various biological methods to validate numerous SEP and small open reading frame (sORF) sequences.

Feature:Due to the property of SEPs having a low molecular weight, SORFPP utilizes a multi-perspective method to extract SEP sequences information. The enrichment of sequence composition information shows positive impact on the prediction of SEPs and ESM-2 could capture the prior knowledge representational information of SEP sequences.

Model:The multi-perspective fusion model computational framework is utilized to enhance model performance. The CatBoost model can process the missing and sparse data to capture non-zero features by splitting features. The self-attention model can capture long-term dependencies between information in the SEPs and selectively assign weights to SEP sequences information. The LR model as the final decision-layer model utilizes the linear combination feature.

Web:For the convenience of subsequent researchers to predict SEP, this experiment develops a graphical user interface that directly uses SORFPP. Users can input sequences of SEP and sORF to obtain the probability of SEP activity.

SORFPP of a fused computational framework was presented to predict the activity of SEPs by integrating multi-perspective features and models on the validated experimental dataset TransLnc. SORFPP consists of three components: 1) The CatBoost model was employed to process the fusion feature that combined amino acids with nucleotides (AN Feature). 2) The self-attention model was utilized to manage the prior knowledge representation information of SEP sequence (ESM Feature) that extracted by the ESM-2 model. 3) The logistic regression model was adopted to calculate the fusion probability that combined the prediction results of the CatBoost model and the self-attention model.

To identify effective features for predicting SEP, feature extraction methods were selected from multiple perspectives. The sequence composition calculation and k-mer feature encoding methods have been proven to contribute positively to the prediction of SEPs through the comparison of features. Thus, the AN Feature was constituted by fusing ten traditional feature encoding methods from amino acid and nucleotide, including k-mer of amino acid and nucleotide, AAC, QSOrder, PAAC, APAAC, CTD and Fickett. To enrich the prior knowledge representation information of SEP sequences, the ESM-2 model was employed to extract the ESM Feature. Moreover, a multi-perspective method was chosen to build a comprehensive integrated model computational framework. The CatBoost model processed the AN Feature to effectively segment sparse values. The self-attention model was utilized to process the ESM Feature by selectively assigning appropriate weights to SEP sequence information. The logistic regression model was adopted to calculate the fusion probability that combined the prediction results of the CatBoost model and the self-attention model.

On three species datasets, SORFPP showed better performance on two evaluation metrics in comparison with state-of-the-art predictors, with enhancement of ACC by 6.1%-12.4% and MCC by 12.2%-24.2%. Additionally, the heatmap of prediction scores for SORFPP and six other methods also visually demonstrated that SORFPP was a reliable predictor for SEP.

Dear Editor and Reviewers:

Thank you for taking out of your busy schedule to review the manuscript. Now we have carefully revised and replied to the manuscript for this version. The revision instructions are as follows:

To Reviewer: 1

Question 1. While the paper introduces a new computational method, SORFPP, for predicting short open reading frames-encoded peptides (SEPs), the objectives and unique contributions are not clearly distinguished from previous studies.

Answer: Thanks for your suggestion. SEP sequence had a lesser molecular weight in comparison with traditional peptide sequence, but it contained important functional structures, such as helices and folds. Besides, SEPs were frequently involved in biological processes, including cell signaling, intercellular interaction, gene expression control, and so on. However, the lack of a comprehensive lncRNA-encoded peptide database and the limitations of feature and model methods within previous predictors made predicting SEPs challenging. In addition, previous research had focused on plant datasets. We had integrated a unique dataset named TransLnc, which encompassed a variety of species including humans, mice, and rats. The richness of this dataset was expected to enhance the depth and scope of our investigative work. Therefore, SORFPP was proposed to improve the performance of predicting SEP by combining machine learning and deep learning methods on the experimentally validated dataset TransLnc. The contribution of SORFPP was elaborated from four perspectives: dataset, feature extraction, model construction, and web interface. In the Highlights section of the paper, we provided a detailed discussion on these aspects.

Highlights

1. Dataset: SORFPP has created a dependable experimental dataset by compiling and analyzing the TransLnc dataset�which utilizes various biological methods to validate numerous SEP and small open reading frame (sORF) sequences.

2. Feature: Due to the property of SEPs having a low molecular weight, SORFPP utilizes a multi-perspective method to extract SEP sequences information. The enrichment of sequence composition information shows positive impact on the prediction of SEPs and ESM-2 could capture the prior knowledge representational information of SEP sequences.

3. Model: The multi-perspective fusion model computational framework is utilized to enhance model performance. The CatBoost model can process the missing and sparse data to capture non-zero features by splitting features. The self-attention model can capture long-term dependencies between information in the SEPs and selectively assign weights to SEP sequences information. The LR model as the final decision-layer model utilizes the linear combination feature.

4. Web: For the convenience of subsequent researchers to predict SEP, this experiment develops a graphical user interface that directly uses SORFPP. Users can input sequences of SEP and sORF to obtain the probability of SEP activity.

Question 2. The manuscript compares SORFPP against other state-of-the-art models using three benchmark datasets. However, it would be beneficial to include statistical significance testing to determine whether the observed performance improvements are genuinely significant.

Answer: Thanks for your suggestion. The prediction scores indicated the probability that the sequence was an SEP. The heatmap of the prediction scores was used to visualize the predictive capabilities of SORFPP and other predictors. Figure 11 illustrated that darker colors represented SEPs and lighter colors indicated non-SEPs. SORFPP predictor was presented in the second column from the right of Figure 11. The last column displayed the true labels of the data. Inspection of the heatmap in Figure 11 revealed that the SORFPP showed a more distinct differentiation. Refer to page 40 of the paper.

Question 3. The study employs multiple feature extraction methods, combining traditional and deep learning features. However, there is limited discussion on how feature selection was conducted.

Answer: Thanks for your suggestion. In this paper, we conducted a detailed analysis of feature extraction and selection. To ensure the effectiveness and diversity of the features, we approached feature extraction and selection from multiple perspectives. Addressing the issue that previous studies only focused on one aspect of either nucleotides or amino acids for feature mining, SORFPP integrates both aspects for information extraction. Through experimentation, we found that feature methods related to the calculation of sequence frequencies contribute to improved prediction performance. Consequently, we sought methods involving frequency calculation within both nucleotide and amino acid approaches. Furthermore, due to the short length of SEP sequences, traditional extraction methods might not fully capture the sequence information. Therefore, to enrich the frequency-related information, we incorporated the ESM method to extract deep features. In Chapter 3 of the paper, we compared 28 traditional amino acid features and 17 traditional nucleotide methods experimentally, resulting in the identification of 10 optimal methods, which were then combined and compared to determine the best performing approach. Ultimately, we used the t-SNE method to visualize the effectiveness of the newly integrated features in distinguishing SEP data. The detailed results can be found in Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Table 3, and Table 4 of the paper.

Question 4. Although the SORFPP model outperforms others in terms of prediction accuracy, the interpretability of the ensemble learning framework remains unclear. Explain how the model interprets or ranks feature importance, especially since SEPs are biologically significant.

Answer: Thanks for your suggestion. To enhance the interpretability of the SORFPP model, we included SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis in the revised manuscript, visually demonstrating the impact and significance of each feature on the model output. The SHAP analysis results indicated that features such as CTD10, QSOrder32, and APAAC14 made significant contributions to the prediction of SEPs and exhibited consistency across different species (human, mouse, rat). The high SHAP values of these features highlighted their critical role in the model predictions. Furthermore, we discussed the biological relevance of these important features. For instance, CTD10 reflects the compositional characteristics of sequences, which are closely related to the structure and function of SEPs. Meanwhile, QSOrder32 and APAAC14 capture the physicochemical properties and sequential features of amino acids, which have a significant impact on the biological functions of SEPs. The detailed results can be found in Figure 1. Refer to Figure 6 in the paper. Refer to page 27 of the paper.

Question 5. The study uses datasets from human, mouse, and rat species for training and evaluation. However, the paper should address how well SORFPP generalizes to other species or datasets not included in this analysis.

Answer: Thank you for your suggestion. To further validate the generalization capability of SORFPP, we assembled datasets from three plant species, including Arabidopsis thaliana (Ath), Glycine max (Gmax) and Physcomitrella patens (Ppatens), and tested SORFPP on these datasets. The experimental results demonstrated that SORFPP exhibited outstanding performance on the plant datasets. For instance, on the Ath dataset, the ACC reached 0.951, the AUC was 0.991, and the MCC was 0.902. Moreover, excellent performance was also achieved on the Gmax and Ppatens datasets. These outcomes indicate that SORFPP possesses strong generalization capabilities across multiple species. The specific results can be found in Table 1. Refer to Table S2 in the supporting information.

Question 6. Machine learning is well-known and has been used in previous sequence analysis studies i.e., PMID: 37649385, PMID: 36174933. Therefore, the authors are suggested to refer to more works in this description to attract a broader readership.

Answer: Thanks for your suggestion. We recognized the significance of machine learning in sequence analysis and acknowledged that our citation of related work in the current version may not have been comprehensive. In the revised manuscript, we carefully reviewed the literature in the field, including the studies mentioned by the reviewers (PMID: 37649385 and PMID: 36174933), and supplemented our references with additional works that pertained to the application of machine learning in sequence analysis. The citations were located in References [37] and [51], with the specific positions detailed in the figure below. Refer to page 7 and 28 of the paper.

Question 7. While the paper mentions limitations of alignment-based methods, a direct comparison with such methods on the same datasets would offer valuable insights into the advantages and disadvantages of using SORFPP.

Answer: Thanks for your suggestion. We acknowledged the value of directly comparing SORFPP with alignment-based methods on the same dataset. However, most previous prediction methods were aimed at identifying sORF sequences, but our study focused on the identification of SEP sequences, and many methods did not provide data for the relevant datasets. Therefore, in the revised manuscript, we included three plant datasets from the sORFPred method and used our proposed SORFPP to predict on these datasets, comparing the results with sORFPred. In the Ath dataset, SORFPP ACC and MCC were 0.951 and 0.902, respectively, sORFPred were 0.887 and 0.775, respectively. In the Gmax dataset, SORFPP ACC and MCC were 0.930 and 0.860, respectively, while sORFPred were 0.881 and 0.761, respectively. In the Ppatens dataset, SORFPP ACC and MCC were 0.898 and 0.795, respectively, whereas sORFPred were 0.842 and 0.686, respectively. The detailed results were presented in Table 10 and Figure 10 (Section 3.4). Refer to page 38 of the paper.

Question 8. The manuscript does not discuss the computational requirements or efficiency of the SORFPP model, which is crucial for high-throughput applications.

Answer: Thanks for your suggestion. SORFPP utilized the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 graphics card. Regarding the computational requirements and efficiency of SORFPP, we have supplemented the processing times for three datasets in the revised manuscript. Detailed results can be found in Table 4. Refer to Table S3 in the supporting information.

Question 9. While the manuscript uses standard metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and AUC, discussing the implications of these results in real-world scenarios, such as predicting SEPs in large-scale genomic projects, would be beneficial.

Answer: Thanks for your suggestion. We recognized that while standard metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and AUC effectively measure the predictive performance of the SORFPP model, the significance and value of these metrics in real-world applications needed to be further elaborated. The following details the specific role and impact of these metrics in predicting SEPs in large-scale genomic projects: (1) Accuracy (ACC), in the context of large-scale genomic projects, the task of predicting SEPs typically involved millions of sequences. A model with low accuracy would result in a substantial number of incorrect predictions (false positives or false negatives), thereby increasing the cost of subsequent experimental validation. In our experiments, SORFPP achieved a high level of accuracy, indicating that it can significantly reduce the number of incorrect predictions. (2) The F1 score addresses the issue of imbalance between positive and negative samples in SEPs data, where functional SEPs were often underrepresented in number. Accuracy was utilized to evaluate model performance might obscure the model ability to predict these important, yet less abundant, positive samples. The F1 score of SORFPP indicated a better balance between precision and recall. For instance, in detecting rare but functionally significant peptides (such as SEPs encoding signaling molecules), a high F1 score ensured that these rare peptides were accurately identified without being overlooked due to data imbalance. (3) The AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) was a critical metric in large-scale screening tasks. In genomic analysis, the classification threshold needed to be adjusted for different projects to optimize results, such as increasing the recall to screen for all possible SEPs, or increasing precision to reduce the experimental workload. The AUC value of SORFPP surpassed that of other predictors, indicating its robust classification capability, whether it was expanding coverage at low thresholds or controlling the false positive rate at high thresholds. For instance, in an actual high-throughput genomic screening project, a model with a higher AUC can ensure the optimal balance point for classification, thereby significantly enhancing prediction efficiency.

Question 10. The manuscript would be strengthened by explicitly discussing the limitations of SORFPP and suggesting future research directions.

Answer: Thanks for your suggestion. In Chapter 5 (Limitations and Future Works) of the thesis, we discussed in detail the limitations and future research directions of SORFPP, including the following points:

Dataset aspect: Although the TransLnc dataset provided a rich resource of sequences, we also recognized that with the development of next-generation sequencing technologies and the construction of more comprehensive databases, it was necessary to continue supplementing and expanding the data samples.

Feature encoding aspect: Traditional encoding methods for peptide sequences were relatively mature, but the feature encoding methods for SEPs awaited further research. We proposed a plan to integrate protein language models, such as Ankh and XProtein GLM, to delve deeper into the sequence information of SEPs.

Model optimization aspect: The process of model selection and optimization was complex, time-consuming, and resource-intensive. We discussed the future integration of automated machine learning (AutoML) tools to improve the efficiency of model training and optimization.

Question 11. Some figures and tables could benefit from more detailed captions and explanations.

Answer: Thanks for your suggestion. We recognized the vital importance of figure captions and explanations in comprehending the research content. In the revised manuscript, we have conducted a comprehensive review of all figure captions and explanations, and have added relevant details where needed to ensure that readers can easily grasp the content displayed in each figure and its scientific implications.

To Reviewer: 2

Question 1. Can you give more details about TransLnc dataset?

Answers: Thanks for your suggestion. The important role of functional peptides encoded by lncRNAs in basic cellular processes and diseases had attracted the attention of many researchers. The presence of functional peptides encoded by lncRNAs emphasizes the need to distinguish between the RNA and peptide-coding functions of lncRNAs. The basic principles of lncRNA translation had been studied. For example, many short sequences, such as N6-methyladenosine modification RNA sites (m6A), had been reported to drive the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-like elements that facilitate the translation of non-coding RNAs. The rapid development of whole-genome translation analysis, ribosome profiling, and mass spectrometry analysis had provided the basic conditions for identifying potential lncRNA-encoded peptides. TransLnc employed six biological methods to identify SEP sequences, including m6A, IRES, whole-genome translation analysis, ribosome profiling, and mass spectrometry analysis, thereby constructing a new comprehensive resource database. At that time, TransLnc documents approximately 583,840 peptides encoded by 33,094 lncRNAs. It integrated six types of direct and indirect evidence that could suggest the coding potential of lncRNAs, with 65.28% of peptides having at least one type of evidence. Considering the strong tissue-specific expression of lncRNAs, TransLnc allowed users to query lncRNA peptides in any of the 34 relevant tissues. Moreover,

Question 1. Why do authors use Categorical Boost instead of Ada Boost for instance?

Answers: Thank you for your insightful question regarding our choice of Categorical Boost over AdaBoost. The selection of the CatBoost model was based on three considerations: the scale of the dataset, the feature methods, and experimental comparisons.

Firstly, the dataset used in this experiment is large in size. CatBoost is specifically designed to handle categorical features without extensive preprocessing, making it particularly suitable for datasets with a large number of categorical variables. In contrast, AdaBoost typically relies on decision trees, which do not locally optimize the encoding of categorical features, potentially leading to suboptimal splits and increased training complexity. Moreover, the feature calculation methods used in this experiment may produce sparse values. CatBoost incorporates regularization techniques, which help to mitigate overfitting. Finally, through experimental comparisons, CatBoost has shown superior performance across various evaluation metrics compared to AdaBoost.

The scarcity of suitable quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators with a significant bulk gap poses a major challenge to the widespread application of the QSH effect. This study employs first-principles calculations to investigate the stability, electronic structure, and topological properties of a fully oxygenated bismuth arsenide system. Without the influence of spin–orbit coupling (SOC), the valence and conduction bands at theΓ-point exhibit a semimetallic nature. However, introducing SOC leads to a substantial 352 meV band gap, which allows operation at room temperature. The calculation of the topological invariant reveals, and the presence of topologically protected edge states in a Dirac cone at theΓpoint confirms the existence of a non-trivial topological state. The epitaxial growth of β-BiAsO2on a SiO2substrate maintains the band topology of β-BiAsO2, spin lock with SOC effect. Additionally, the fully oxidized surfaces of β-BiAsO2are inherently resistant to surface oxidation and degradation, suggesting a promising approach for developing room-temperature topological quantum devices. These findings not only introduce new vitality into the 2D group-VA materials family and enrich the available candidate materials in this field but also highlight the potential of these 2D semiconductors as appealing ultrathin materials for future flexible electronics and optoelectronics devices.

This paper examines a BiAsO2systemviafirst-principles calculations, revealing aEg=352 meV and, highlighting its potential for room-temperature quantum devices and flexible electronics.

The next generation of emerging devices is poised to leverage sophisticated semiconductors that exhibit high sensitivity to incident photons and efficient charge transport. This advancement is largely attributed to the unique properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials, which have recently gained significant attention as promising candidates for various applications. These materials are characterized by their exceptional transparency, mechanical flexibility, ultra-thin nature, high carrier mobility, and strong interaction with light, making them ideal for optoelectronic devices and next-generation electronics. The versatility of 2D materials has opened up new possibilities in fields such as photovoltaics, sensors, flexible electronics, and quantum technologies. Among the most notable materials in this context are the group VA elements. These materials have emerged as a significant area of research due to their large fundamental band gaps,1–3which enhance their potential for use in semiconducting applications. The semiconducting behaviors of group VA 2D materials position them as viable candidates for optoelectronic devices, particularly when compared to other 2D materials such as group IVA (including silicene, graphene, germanene, and stanene) and group IIIA (borophene). For instance, despite its high carrier mobility and mechanical strength, graphene lacks a natural band gap, limiting its utility in semiconductor devices. In contrast, group VA materials offer tunable band gaps and robust electronic properties, making them more suitable for practical applications in electronics and photonics.4

The exploration of topological insulators (TIs) has also gained momentum, particularly with the contributions of researchers like Kane and Mele, who first introduced the concept of the quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator in graphene.5Their groundbreaking work demonstrated that materials with strong spin–orbit coupling (SOC) could exhibit insulating behavior in the bulk while conducting electricity on their surfaces through topologically protected edge states. However, the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) in graphene is relatively weak, resulting in a very small band gap at the Dirac point, ∼10−3meV. This limitation has spurred interest in other 2D materials with stronger SOC effects, such as Bi2Se3and Sb2Te3, which exhibit larger band gaps and more robust topological properties.6,7The emergence of band topology has opened new avenues in the study of topological quantum states, leading to the discovery of various exotic phases of matter, including Weyl semimetals,8topological insulators (TIs), topological Dirac semimetals, and node-line semimetals.9For example, Weyl semimetals host massless fermions known as Weyl fermions, which are characterized by their chiral nature and high mobility. These properties make them promising candidates for low-power electronics and quantum devices. Similarly, topological insulators, with their surface states protected by time-reversal symmetry,5offer potential applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing and energy-efficient electronics. The integration of group VA 2D materials into the next generation of electronic devices holds great promise due to their favorable semiconducting properties and the potential for novel applications in optoelectronics and quantum technologies.10The ongoing research into their unique characteristics and behaviors, including their electronic, optical, and thermal properties, will likely lead to significant advancements in the field. Moreover, developing scalable synthesis techniques and device fabrication methods will be crucial for translating these materials from the laboratory to real-world applications.11As researchers uncover new insights into the fundamental properties of these materials, their potential to revolutionize technology across multiple domains becomes increasingly evident.

Two-dimensional (2D) topological insulators (TIs),1–3particularly quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators,12–15represent a significant advancement in the field of condensed matter physics and materials science. These materials exhibit unique electronic properties due to their topologically protected edge states, which allow electrons to flow along the edges of the material without significant backscattering.5This characteristic gives 2D-TIs a slight advantage over their three-dimensional (3D) counterparts, as the restriction of electron flow to 2D inherently limits backscattering and enhances conductivity. The robustness of these edge states against non-magnetic impurities and defects makes 2D-TIs highly promising for applications in low-power electronics, spintronics, and quantum computing. Several 2D materials have been theoretically predicted and experimentally investigated for their potential to exhibit topological insulator phases. Among these are silicene,16germanene,16phosphorene,17arsenene,18antimonene,19and bismuthine.6,20–24These materials are particularly intriguing because of their ability to undergo a topological phase transition from normal insulators to topological insulators under specific conditions, such as strain, electric fields, or chemical functionalization. For instance, silicene and germanene, which are the silicon and germanium analogs of graphene, have been shown to exhibit topological insulating behavior when subjected to external perturbations. Similarly, stanene, a tin-based 2D material, has been predicted to host a large-gap QSH state,25–27making it a strong candidate for room-temperature applications.22Bismuthine has also garnered significant attention due to its strong spin–orbit coupling (SOC) and potential for topological phase transitions. Hence, antimonene has been shown to possess a sizable band gap and robust topological properties, making it a promising material for next-generation electronic devices.28

Experimentally, the realization of 2D-TIs has been demonstrated in systems such as HgTe/CdTe and InAs/GaSb quantum wells.29These systems have been extensively studied and confirmed to exhibit QSH insulator behavior at very low temperatures (below 10 K). The HgTe/CdTe quantum well, in particular, was the first experimentally verified 2D-TI, showcasing quantized edge conductance due to the presence of helical edge states. However, despite these successes, significant challenges remain. The small bulk band gaps of these materials, typically on the order of a few meV, limit their operational temperature range and make them unsuitable for ambient temperature applications.30–32In addition, these materials with conventional semiconductor devices pose technical challenges as a result of differences in material properties and fabrication processes. The limitations of current 2D TIs have spurred research into alternative materials and strategies to achieve larger band gaps and higher operating temperatures. Moreover, strain, external electric fields, or chemical doping have been proposed to enhance the topological properties of existing 2D materials.17,18,22Advances in material synthesis and characterization techniques, such as molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)33and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES),34have also played a crucial role in the discovery and understanding of new 2D TIs.6,35,36While challenges such as small band gaps and low operational temperatures remain. The discovery of new 2D TIs with robust topological properties and compatibility with existing technologies will be critical for realizing their full potential in practical applications.37–44In addition, due to their strong SOC effect, bismuth and arsenic are full of electronic sources in buckled and planar hexagonal formations, such as bismuth-based systems, which are good materials for TIs. For example, Bi2Se3and Bi2Te3are well-known binary compounds known as strong TIs.45,46Arsenene in the α and β-phases, on the other hand, were tuned from conventional insulators to topological insulators under strain modification and were found to be energetically stable at ambient temperature.47–50As a result, finding a suitable 2D topological insulator with a wide band gap is an important research topic. Therefore, finding nontoxic and experimentally feasible QSH insulators is critical. Thus, radical functionalizations like methyl (–CH3), ethynyl(–C2H), and cyano(–CN) group have been proposed QSH effect.32,39,51,52Based on first-principles calculations, BiAs oxide at room temperature provides a promising candidate for designing future electronic devices.

The first principle calculations were implemented by the Viennaab initiosimulation package (VASP).53,54The exchange–correlation term is described within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) parameterized by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.55A large vacuum space of 25 Å is set along thec-axis to avoid the interaction between layers caused by the periodic boundary condition. The kinetic-energy cutoff plane-wave functions are 450 eV, and all atom coordinates and lattice constants were optimized until the convergence of force on each atom less than 0.001 eV Å−1and the total energy convergence threshold was set to be 10−6eV. Thek-mesh of 5 × 5 × 1 and 11 × 11 × 1 Monkhorst–Packk-point grid was adopted for geometry optimization and self-consistent calculation, respectively.54The effect of SOC being included in self-consistently in the electronic structure calculations.56Beside SOC effect,57the hybrid HSE06 functional addresses some of the limitations of the PBE functional in predicting band structures by providing better estimates of the electronic band gaps.58Phonon calculations are performed using the PHONOPY code56combined with the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) method in VASP, andab initiomolecular dynamics (MD) simulations59were performed to verify stabilities at 300 K.

We previously explored the electronic structures of two-dimensional (2D) bismuth arsenide (BiAs) polymorphs. Our investigations revealed that among these new materials, the β-BiAs adopts a stable structure. Notably, we observed a significant phase transition in β-BiAs, shifting from a normal insulator to a topological insulator as we applied a tensile strain of 12%. This transition occurred without and with spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effects.64This paper presents oxygenated β-BiAs as a novel class of strain-effect-free 2D topological insulators. The addition of oxygen to the β-BiAs structure improve its electrical characteristics, opening up new research directions in the field of topological materials. The oxygenated form of β-BiAs, to evaluate its topological properties, electronic band structure, and stability. This work not only contributes to our understanding of the behavior of β-BiAs but also paves the way for the development of novel materials that may exhibit robust topological states in practical applications. Bismuth is known for its high mobility of charge carriers, which facilitates efficient spin transport, an essential feature for spintronics applications that leverage both charge and spin degrees of freedom,19and bismuthine.6,20–24,65Its distinctive electronic properties make it suitable for use in magnetic tunnel junctions, thereby improving the performance of memory devices. Furthermore, adding bismuth to spin transistors can provide devices that make use of electron spin, which may lead to lower power consumption and faster speeds. Bi2As3is one of the bismuth compounds that exhibits topological insulating properties. Bismuth's special qualities also make it a strong contender for quantum bits in quantum computing, where efficient spin state management is essential. The investigation of fully oxygenated β-BiAs is a promising development in the search for novel materials with topological characteristics that may result in important breakthroughs in electrical devices of the future. In the β-BiAs monolayer, each arsenic atom is covalently bonded to three neighboring bismuth atoms, forming sp2-like hybridized orbitals. This arrangement is complemented by the presence of weak π orbitals, which contribute to the overall electronic structure of the material. Due to this bonding configuration, nonbonding lone-pair electrons reside in the remaining orbitals of each arsenic atom. This unique electronic band structure characteristic as shown in Fig. S1(a)†renders the system particularly susceptible to forming dative bonds with other elements that possess strong electronegativity, such as oxygen and fluorine.

Given this propensity for bonding, the creation of stable oxygenated β-BiAs monolayers. These functionalized materials could exhibit significantly altered properties, opening up new possibilities for applications in various fields. In this study, focused on the effects of oxygenation in β-BiAs by examining three distinct structural configurations. These configurations include: (i) O–As–Bi as shown in Fig. S2(a)†an oxygen atom is bonded primarily to the arsenic atom, which influences the electronic properties as shown in Fig. S2(b and c)†and the stability of the monolayer. (ii) As–Bi–O as shown in Fig. S3(a)†the oxygen atom is attached to the bismuth atom, potentially altering the electronic interactions within the material and enhancing its reactivity or conductivity as shown in Fig. S3(b and c)†and (iii) O–Bi–As–O this configuration involves the incorporation of two oxygen atoms, which could lead to more pronounced changes in the electronic structure and the overall stability of the β-BiAsO2monolayer as illustrated in Fig. S4(a–d).†By investigating these three structures O–As–Bi, As–Bi–O, and O–Bi–As–O to understand how the oxygen affects the electronic characteristics and stability of β-BiAs. This work could provide valuable insights into the design of new materials that leverage the unique properties of oxygen-functionalized β-BiAs, ultimately contributing to advancements in electronic devices and other applications that require materials with specific electronic and chemical properties.

As illustrated in Fig. S4(a)†the optimized lattice structure of β-BiAsO2. This structure adopts a hexagonal configuration characteristic of oxygenated β-BiAs, which comprises four atoms per unit cell. The specific parameters of this lattice reveal important insights into its geometric and electronic properties. The buckling height of the structure is measured at 1.56 Å. The buckling height is significant because it influences the electronic properties and stability of the monolayer. The lattice constant is calculated as 4.605 Å, which defines the repeating unit of the crystal structure in the 2D plane. The Bi–As bond length is 2.94 Å, indicating a longer covalent interaction between the bismuth and arsenic atoms. Furthermore, the Bi–O bond length is calculated to be 1.95 Å, suggesting a robust interaction between the bismuth and oxygen atoms. This shorter bond length typically implies a stronger interaction, which could enhance the stability of the oxygenated structure and facilitate the formation of dative bonds with electronegative elements. The bond length of the As–O atoms is calculated to be 1.7 Å. This length reflects the nature of the bonding interactions within the structure and may influence how the β-BiAsO2behaves under different conditions, such as temperature fluctuations or external pressures. Hence, the detailed analysis of the optimized lattice structure of β-BiAsO2not only highlights the specific geometric parameters but also underscores the potential implications for its electronic properties as shown in Fig. S4(b–d)†and suitability for various applications in advanced materials and devices. Understanding these characteristics is vital for further exploration and optimization of oxygenated β-BiAs for practical uses in electronics, photonics, and beyond. The optimized structure of BiAsO2reveal its hexagonal arrangement as shown inFig. 1(a). The clear depiction of the bonding geometry indicates the presence of covalent interactions between Bi and As, as well as between Bi and O, which are essential for the material's robustness. As shown inFig. 1(d)the energy fluctuation as a function of the lattice parameter provides insights into the stability of the β-BiAsO2structure. The curve indicates that there is a specific lattice constant at which the energy is minimized, suggesting that this is the most stable configuration for β-BiAsO2at 4.6 Å. Deviations from this optimal lattice parameter lead to increased energy, which can imply potential instability or unfavorable properties. The electrostatic potential as observed inFig. 1(e)the variation in potential energy across the vacuum level, and the work function are around 2.851 eV and 7.975 eV, respectively. The presence of distinct potential wells can indicate regions of varying electronic density, which influence charge transport and reactivity. Analyzing the electrostatic potential profile helps in understanding how β-BiAsO2interacts with external electric fields, which is particularly relevant for electronic and optoelectronic applications. The Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) image as shown inFig. 1(c)provides a real-space visualization of the surface morphology of β-BiAsO2. The high-resolution image captures the atomic arrangement and allows for the identification of surfaces. The contrast in the STM image can reflect variations in local electronic states, which can further inform on the material's surface electronic properties. The formation energy can be used to estimate the structure's stability. The formation energy is calculated using the following expression:

whereETandEBiAsare the energies of β-BiAs systems with and without oxygen, and the energy of O2molecule. The binding energy is calculated to be −1.75 eV per unit cell.



The absences of imaginary frequencies show that β-BiAsO2is dynamically stable as shown inFig. 1(b). Additionally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on the β-BiAsO2for 10 ps with a time step of 1.0 fs at 300 K. The MD simulations indicate that these β-BiAsO2were also thermally stable at room temperature. The radial distribution function (RDF) analysis for As–Bi, Bi–O, and As–O, bonds provides insights into the local structure and bonding characteristics of the material as shown inFig. 1(f)peaks in the RDF correspond to specific bond lengths, indicating the presence of preferred distances between atoms for As–Bi, Bi–O, and As–O around 2.95 Å, 1.6 Å and 1.7 Å, respectively. This information is essential for understanding the interactions within the material and can help predict its mechanical, thermal, and electronic properties. The RDF can also reveal how these interactions change with different conditions, such as temperature or external pressure. What effect do these oxidations have on β-BiAsO2electrical properties? To solve this problem, the electronic band structures of 2D β-BiAs oxides were calculated. The effect of oxygen functionalization on the electronic and structural properties of β-BiAs monolayers is illustrated through variousFig. 2and3. The band gap for free standing β-BiAs calculated at the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) level is reported to be a notable 1.02 eV in the absence of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect. This value indicates that β-BiAs behaves as a semiconductor, with a significant energy gap that separates the valence and conduction bands as shown inFig. 2(a and b)with and without SOC effect. When we compare this to the band structure of the β-BiAsO2monolayer, as shown inFig. 3(a and b), the band structure reveals gapless semiconductor behavior, with the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum both located at theΓpoint. This indicates that the introduction of oxygen functionalization effectively alters the electronic properties of the material, suggesting a transformation from a bandgap semiconductor to a topological insulator with gapless characteristics. For the structures As–Bi–O and Bi–As–O, shown in Fig. S2(c) and S3(c),†the electronic band gaps are significantly reduced to approximately 0.003 eV and 0.006 eV, respectively. These extremely small band gaps suggest that both functionalized structures approach a metallic state, where the distinction between the valence and conduction bands is minimal. In contrast to the various derivatives of β-BiAsX (X = Br2, CH3, CN, Cl2, F2, H2, I2, and NH2), as shown inTable 1and Fig. S5, S6,†the electronic properties of these materials reveal significant differences. For the PBE calculations, the semiconductor band gaps were observed to lie between 0.45 eV and 1.75 eV as illustrated in Fig. S7–S10.†This range suggests that the materials can effectively facilitate electronic transitions at relatively low energy levels, making them suitable for applications in optoelectronic and photo-detection, where lower energy photons are of interest. In the HSE06 for calculations the band gap expands to a range of 0.63 eV to 2.08 eV. In contrast of the functional β-BiAsX (X = Br2, CH3, CN, Cl2, F2, H2, I2, and NH2) HSE06 bandgap around 0.009 eV as shown in Fig. S13(a and b).†This broader range indicates a more refined assessment of the electronic structure, reflecting the influence of hybridization and the exchange–correlation effects captured by the HSE06 method. The higher band gap values suggest improved electronic properties, which could enhance the material's performance in electronic devices where a wider band gap is beneficial. The variation in band gap values underscores the potential for tailoring these materials for specific applications through careful selection of their chemical composition and the computational techniques employed to analyze their properties.





Furthermore, the Dirac cones observed in these structures indicate that the VBM and CBM are closely aligned, occurring at theΓ-point for Bi–As–O and As–Bi–O as shown in Fig. S2(c) and S3(c).†The oxidation not only reduces the band gap but also leads to the emergence of Dirac-like states, suggesting the potential for new electronic properties and applications for these functionalized materialsEg= 352 meV with SOC as shown inFig. 3(b)and S4(c).†This highlights the importance of oxygen functionalization in tuning the electronic characteristics of β-BiAs monolayers, indicating a pathway toward designing materials with desired electronic properties for future applications in electronic devices and topological insulators.

The topological properties and spin characteristics of β-BiAsO2as shown inFig. 4(a–c), includes three primary components: the calculation of the Wilson loop, the Berry phase spectrum, and the spin texture of β-BiAsO2. The calculation of the Wilson loop along thekydirection provides essential information about the topological nature of β-BiAsO2as shown inFig. 4(a). The p-orbitals close to the Fermi level separate into two categories: the pxand pyorbitals, and the pzorbital. By projecting the bands of the px, py, and pzorbitals onto various atomic orbitals, it was observed that the energy spectrum of β-BiAsO2near the Fermi level is primarily influenced by the pxand pyorbitals. In this context, the Wilson loop is used to determine the position of the Wannier charge centers, which are indicative of the material's topological invariants. The Wannier function (Wn(r)) is obtained by Fourier transforming the Bloch states:

whereΩis the volume of the Brillouin zone, |un(k)〉 are the periodic parts of the Bloch functions. The topological invariant can then be computed as:

whereθn(k) is the phase of the overlap between adjacent Wannier functions.60–63The result yieldingconfirms that β-BiAsO2is topological insulator. The value ofsignifies that the material has protected edge states. These edge states arise due to the non-trivial topology of the band structure, making the material robust against certain types of perturbations. The Berry phase spectrum provides additional insight into the electronic structure of β-BiAsO2as shown inFig. 4(b). This spectrum illustrates how the Berry curvature varies across the Brillouin zone. The peaks and troughs in the spectrum correspond to different electronic bands and highlight regions where the Berry curvature is significant. The Berry curvature is directly related to the topological properties of the material and can influence phenomena such as the anomalous Hall effect. The visualization of the Berry phase spectrum enables a deeper understanding of the interplay between the electronic bands and the topological features of the material, further corroborating its classification as a topological insulator. Thek-space Berry phases can be applied to extract topological properties of solids. For an isolated band, the Berry phase is calculated

wherekiis the component of crystal momentum corresponding tobiin reduced coordinates. The Berry phase is only gauge invariant modulo 2π and sinceγ1(k2,k3) =γ1(k2+ 1,k3) =γ1(k2,k3+ 1) modulo 2π, it can be count how many multiples of the 2π thatγ1changes whilek2ofk3is adiabatically cycled through the Brillouin zone. This is the Chern number, which gives rise to a topologicalclassification of all 2D insulators. For multiple valence bands the situation is slightly more complicated and one has to introduce the notion of parallel transport to obtain the Berry phases of individual bands.62The spin texture illustrated inFig. 4(c)represents the spatial distribution of the spin polarization across the surface of β-BiAsO2. The arrows indicate the orientation of the spin, while the color gradient reflects the magnitude of the spin polarization. This visualization is crucial for understanding the spin properties of the material. The presence of a well-defined spin texture suggests that the spins are coupled to the electronic states in a way that could enable spin-polarized currents, potentially leading to devices that utilize both charge and spin for enhanced performance. Moreover, effectively as shown inFig. 4(a–c)the topological and spin properties of β-BiAsO2. The calculations of the Wilson loop confirm its status as a topological insulator, while the Berry phase spectrum and spin texture provide crucial insights into its electronic behavior and spin dynamics. Together, these elements underscore the potential of β-BiAsO2for advanced applications in electronic and spintronic devices.



As shown inFig. 5(a and b)the epitaxial growth of β-BiAsO2as a topological insulator and its electronic properties, particularly to spin polarization. The side and top views of the structure β-BiAsO2show its layered arrangement, which is crucial to understanding its growth on a SiO2substrate, as shown inFig. 5(a). The epitaxial growth process significantly affects the electronic properties of the β-BiAsO2material, including its band structure and spin polarization. The structure of the band as shown inFig. 5(b)provides crucial information on the electronic states of β-BiAsO2, both without and with spin orbit coupling (SOC). The presence of the Dirac states is evident, which are characteristic of topological insulators. These states are marked by a crossing of the conduction and valence bands at the Dirac point, indicating a zero band gap atΓpoint. In the absence of SOC, the band structure may display a simpler electronic configuration. However, the inclusion of SOC introduces significant modifications, leading to a rich spin texture. The band structure plot suggest that the spin polarization is nontrivial, with the Dirac edge states exhibiting polarization characteristics. This polarization can lead to the generation of spin-polarized currents, which are invaluable for developing next-generation devices that utilize both charge and spin for information processing. Hence, this figure effectively illustrates the epitaxial growth of β-BiAsO2on a SiO2substrate and highlights its electronic properties through the band structure analysis. The insights gained from the structural and electronic characteristics underscore the potential of β-BiAsO2as a topological insulator, particularly in applications that leverage its unique spin polarization features. Understanding these aspects can guide further research and development in the field of spintronics and novel electronic materials. The lattice mismatch between the β-BiAsO2and SiO2is measured to be just 0.07 Å, which is quite minimal and indicative of a well-matched interface. This small mismatch, combined with an interlayer distance of 4.102 Å, facilitates the formation of a stable van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure. Such stability is essential for ensuring the integrity and performance of the material system during practical applications. The binding energy of the heterostructure has been calculated to be −0.032 eV per unit cell. This negative value suggests that the interactions holding the layers together are relatively weak and are primarily due to dispersion forces, which are characteristic of vdW interactions. Such weak binding can be beneficial in applications where flexibility and tunability of the layers are desired, allowing for easy manipulation of the heterostructure properties without significant energy penalties. The band structure of the β-BiAsO2/SiO2heterostructure shows remarkable stability, remaining largely unperturbed regardless of the inclusion of spin–orbit coupling (SOC), as shown inFig. 5(b). The electronic states of the heterostructure are robust against changes in the electronic environment. Furthermore, Bader charge analysis confirms that there is no significant charge transfer occurring between the β-BiAsO2and the SiO2layers. This lack of charge transfer is critical, as it suggests that the electronic properties of β-BiAsO2remain intact when integrated with SiO2, allowing the material to retain its unique characteristics. The orbitals near the Fermi level are predominantly contributed by the bismuth and arsenic atoms, indicating that these elements play a crucial role in defining the electronic behavior of the heterostructure. Additionally, calculating the charge density difference further supports these findings, revealing the spatial distribution of charge within the heterostructure. Understanding these electronic interactions and charge distributions is vital for optimizing the performance of the β-BiAsO2/SiO2system. Thus, a minimal lattice mismatch, weak binding interactions, and unperturbed electronic properties position this vdW heterostructure as a promising candidate for future technological advancements.



Recently, significant progress has been made in the synthesis of various 2D TIs.39,48,66–72This expansion of materials showcases a promising diversity for potential applications in quantum computing, spintronics, and other advanced electronic devices. Among the recently synthesized 2D TIs, bismuthene,19and bismuthine6,20–24has demonstrated unique electronic properties that can be attributed to strong spin–orbit coupling (SOC), making it a robust candidate for further exploration. Similarly, plumbene73and stanene74have attracted attention for their potential to exhibit nontrivial topological behavior at room temperature, driven primarily by their structural characteristics and the presence of heavy elements with significant SOC. Furthermore, the β-BiAsO2/SiO2heterostructure is a notable example in this emerging category of materials. Its topology remains stable and is not influenced by perturbations from the substrate on which it is grown. This stability is essential for practical applications, as it may alleviate issues related to substrate-induced instability that have affected previous materials under external influences. A key aspect of topological insulators is their band gap characteristics. Generally, many heavy metal-based 2D TIs exhibit significant bulk gaps, often exceeding 0.1 eV, due to their strong spin–orbit coupling (SOC) interactions. On the other hand, some lighter elements, while showing promise as TIs, often exhibit smaller bulk gaps. For instance, graphene displays a gap as small as 10−3meV,5while silicene's gap ranges from 1.55 to 2.9 meV,16and germanene's gap is between 23.9 and 108 meV.17Conversely, arsenene is noted to have a more significant gap of approximately 696 meV,18and few-layered black phosphorus is reported at 5 meV.17Furthermore, arsenene oxide has garnered attention due to its somewhat larger gap of 232 meV,49,50hinting at the effects of oxidation37,75,76on the electronic configuration of the base arsenene structure.70,71,77–82Notably, the newly predicted 2D β-BiAsO2binary compound appears to have a sizable gap up to 352 meV, indicative of its substantial potential as a robust nontrivial topological insulator.

In general, research on 2D topological insulators (TIs), particularly those composed of heavy metals with strong spin–orbit coupling (SOC), has facilitated improvements in material properties that are applicable in practice. The synthesis of materials such as β-BiAsO2and arsenene oxide not only underscores the significance of bulk gap size in shaping TI behavior but also highlights the potential to investigate new materials with improved topological features. As we explore the relationships among material composition, structural properties, and substrate interactions, the field of 2D TIs is likely to continue evolving, creating further opportunities for innovation in advanced electronics and spintronic applications. Developing comprehensive theoretical and experimental frameworks to understand these complex materials will be crucial for guiding future research and designing next-generation topological insulator devices. The expanding catalog of 2D TIs represents an exciting frontier in materials science, driven by both fundamental research interests and practical technological goals. Progress in this area could usher in a new era of electronic materials, integrating the complexities of quantum mechanics with real-world applications that could transform our approach to electronics and information processing.

Hence 2D β-BiAsO2experimentally realized using bismuth oxide (Bi2O3), arsenic trioxide (As2O3), silicon dioxide (SiO2) or h-BN substrate, solvents (e.g., ethanol, water), precursor solutions (if using a sol–gel process), and high-temperature furnace or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) setup. Synthesizing and characterizing β-BiAsO2as a 2D topological insulator demands advanced growth techniques, such as Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) and Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), along with a range of structural, electronic, and magnetic characterization methods. Achieving β-BiAsO2could lead to the development of new topological devices that operate at room temperature; however, precise control over synthesis parameters and substrate interactions is crucial for maintaining its topological characteristics.

The limited availability of effective quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators that possess a notable bulk gap presents a significant obstacle to the large-scale implementation of the QSH effect. In this study, first-principles calculations are utilized to explore the stability, electronic characteristics, and topological features of a fully oxygenated bismuth arsenide system. In the absence of spin–orbit coupling (SOC), the valence and conduction bands at theΓ-point show a semimetallic behavior. Conversely, once SOC is accounted for, a considerable band gap of 352 meV is produced, allowing for functionality at room temperature. The evaluation of the topological invariant indicates, while topologically protected edge states observed in a Dirac cone at theΓ-point affirm the presence of a nontrivial topological state. The epitaxial integration of β-BiAsO2onto a SiO2substrate preserves the band topology of β-BiAsO2, demonstrating a significant band gap without SOC alongside a spin lock feature when SOC is present. Furthermore, the fully oxidized surfaces of β-BiAs display a natural resistance to oxidation and degradation, pointing towards a promising pathway for the advancement of room-temperature topological quantum devices.

Medium chain acyl‐CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) is an inherited metabolic disease, characterized by biallelic variants in theACADMgene. Interestingly, even with the same genotype, patients often present with very heterogeneous symptoms, ranging from fully asymptomatic to life‐threatening hypoketotic hypoglycemia. The mechanisms underlying this heterogeneity remain unclear. Therefore, there is a need for in vitro models of MCADD that recapitulate the clinical phenotype as a tool to study the pathophysiology of the disease. Fibroblasts of control and symptomatic MCADD patients with the c.985A>G (p.K329E) were reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). iPSCs were then differentiated into hepatic expandable organoids (EHOs), further matured to Mat‐EHOs, and functionally characterized. EHOs and Mat‐EHOs performed typical hepatic metabolic functions, such as albumin and urea production. The organoids metabolized fatty acids, as confirmed by acyl‐carnitine profiling and high‐resolution respirometry.

Mat‐EHOs expressed relevant pathways involved in putative compensatory mechanisms, notably CoA metabolism and the TCA cycle. The upregulation ofNUDT7expression may play a role in preventing excessive accumulation of dicarboxylic acids in MCADD.

Medium‐chain acyl‐CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) is one of the flavoenzymes that catalyze the first step of mitochondrial β‐oxidation of fatty acids. It oxidizes medium‐chain acyl‐CoA into 2‐enoyl‐CoA. MCAD deficiency (MCADD) is an autosomal recessive disease and the most common fatty acid oxidation disorder (FAOD) with a prevalence of 1/8300 in the Netherlands [1]. Interestingly, people homozygous for the prevalent c.985A>G (p.K329E)ACADMvariant can present various clinical phenotypes. While some patients remain asymptomatic throughout life, some experience life‐threatening hypoketotic hypoglycemia when exposed to catabolic stress (e.g., fasting and intercurrent illness) [2,3,4]. After diagnosis, the most common treatment relies on avoidance of fasting and an emergency regimen [5,6]. While this variant is estimated to account for more than 90% of pathogenic alleles, the implementation of MCADD in population newborn screening programs has revealed severalACADMvariants of unknown clinical significance [7]. The clinical risk associated with individual variants and the mechanisms underlying metabolic decompensation remain unclear for individual patients [7,8]. Patients with residual MCAD activity, equal to or above 10%, have been referred to as mild and often remain asymptomatic [1]. However, within the cohort of c.985A>G (p.K329E) homozygotes, patients may present with a wide range of symptoms and disease severity, suggesting a limited genotype–phenotype correlation. Therefore, it is likely that genetic variation beyond theACADMgene, the environment, and epigenetics play a major role in the development of a metabolic crisis [9].

Preclinical, mechanistic studies of the pathophysiology underlying MCADD have traditionally relied on the use of animal models [10,11,12]. However, rodents are equipped with an extra dehydrogenase, long‐chain acyl‐CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD), which shows overlapping substrate specificity with MCAD [13] and may therefore mask the phenotype. Additionally, a full deletion of the functional MCAD enzyme cannot elucidate the effect of individual point mutations in theACADMgene. This makes human and patient‐derived in vitro models an attractive alternative for the study of MCADD. Organoids are 3D multicellular structures that proliferate in vitro while recapitulating several functions of the organ of origin. They can be obtained from primary tissue as well as from pluripotent and adult stem cells [14]. Liver organoids recapitulate several hepatic functions such as albumin production, bile acid production, and CYP3A4 activity [15]. Since they were first described [16], organoids have been used for an increasing number of applications including the study of differentiation, organ development [17], and (metabolic) disease [18], as well as drug screening [19]. For primary tissue, highly invasive liver biopsies are required. In contrast, hepatobiliary organoids can also be derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) [20,21,22,23]. The latter can be obtained from fibroblasts, lymphoblasts, or even urine cells, providing an expandable source of hepatic cells through a minimally invasive procedure [24]. Several protocols have been developed for differentiating iPSCs into hepatobiliary organoids. Although these organoids remain closer to fetal than to adult tissue [25,26,27], they represent an important organ‐specific system to understand not only the disease mechanism but also patient‐specific phenotypes and symptomatology.

Patient‐specific iPSC‐derived MCADD hepatobiliary organoids could serve (i) to study the effect of different mutations in theACADMgene itself and (ii) to study compensatory mechanisms that may depend on genetic variation outside theACADMgene. To realize this goal, it is important that organoids recapitulate the major biochemical phenotype. Moreover, pathways that have been hypothesized to play a compensatory role in asymptomatic patients should be active in the organoids. Putative compensatory enzymes and pathways include short‐chain acyl‐CoA dehydrogenase [28], peroxisomal β‐oxidation [29] and coenzyme A metabolism [28]. Whereas the MCAD enzyme is localized in the mitochondria, peroxisomes are single‐membrane organelles equipped with their own β‐oxidation pathway. They are involved in many metabolic processes and are highly abundant in liver cells. They are renowned for their ability to oxidize branched‐chain and very‐long‐chain fatty acids [30], yet they are also capable of oxidizing medium‐chain fatty acids (MCFA) [29,31] and fatty dicarboxylic acids [32]. To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no experimental studies reporting on the role of peroxisomes in any of the deficiencies of mitochondrial dehydrogenases (SCADD, MCADD and VLCADD).

The goal of this study was to establish and characterize an iPSC‐derived hepatobiliary organoid system for the study of MCADD. iPSCs derived from fibroblasts of symptomatic MCADD patients with the classical c.985A>G (p.K329E) mutation were differentiated into hepatic organoids and compared to organoids from healthy controls. Here we demonstrate that MCADD organoids recapitulate typical diagnostic MCADD metabolites. Moreover, mature organoids upregulate peroxisomal markers, making them a suitable system to study patient‐specific differences in peroxisomal metabolism. Finally, we report a minor regulation of peroxisomal CoA metabolism in organoids derived from symptomatic MCADD patients.

Control and MCADD fibroblasts were reprogrammed into iPSCs following a previously published protocol [33]. Immunofluorescence confirmed the expression of NANOG, OCT4, SOX2, SSEA‐4, Tra‐1‐60, and Tra‐1‐81, indicating the pluripotency of the iPSCs (FigureS1).

In order to differentiate iPSCs into hepatic organoids, a previously published protocol [20] was slightly adapted (Figure1A): to supplement Wnt3a and hRspon1, conditioned medium was used instead of recombinant proteins. At Day 8, the cells were transferred from 2D culture and embedded into BME domes and cultured in expansion medium (EM) for at least 10 days. Morphological changes in the cells were observed at the different stages of the differentiation (Figure1B). While most of the organoids were cystic and contained clear lumina, more complex structures could also be observed. Some organoids formed “lobule‐like” structures emerging from a central structure (Figure1B). At this stage, expandable hepatic organoids (EHO) could be cryopreserved and—after thawing—expanded in culture for several passages without any clear morphological changes.

Lower graph: Albumin released in supernatant by organoids (blue) in 24 h. Data represents 10 biological replicates for the organoids and 3 biological replicates for the PCLS from independent experiments. All graphs: Error bars indicate SEM.

In order to assess cell identity at the different stages of differentiation, the gene expression profile of the organoids was characterized (Figure1C–E). We defined different developmental stages including iPSCs, definitive endoderm (DE), hepatoblasts (HB), and EHOs (Figure1A,B), and compared them to human liver biopsies. Endoderm‐specific markersSOX17,FOXA2,GATA4, andGATA6were all induced at the DE stage.FOX2A,GATA4, andGATA6stayed higher than in the iPSCs at all stages, whileSOX17declined in EHOs, resembling the liver reference (Figure1C). Early hepatic specification markersTBX3andHNF4‐αwere already observed in the DE stage but peaked in the EHOs. For alpha‐fetoprotein (AFP), a fetal hepatocyte marker, we observed a peak in expression at the stage of EHOs and barely any presence in the earlier stages, nor in liver tissue. The hepatic marker albumin was not observed until later stages of the differentiation (HB) and showed its maximal expression in the EHOs. Interestingly, the albumin expression was very high in the EHOs and almost comparable to that in human liver (Figure1D). Finally, the expression of early biliary markersCK19andSOX19(Figure1E) illustrates the presence of more than one cell type in the organoids. Together, these results highlight that the differentiation protocol from iPSCs into EHOs recapitulates the early stages of hepatic development.

Different functional assays as well as immunostainings were performed in the EHOs to determine their “liver‐like” state. Immunostainings of the EHOs in culture revealed the expression of more mature hepatic markersALBandHNF4‐α(Figure1F). Finally, the functionality of EHOs was confirmed by the secretion of albumin and urea into the supernatant (Figure1G).

In order to stimulate fatty‐acid metabolism, we treated the organoids either with bovine serum albumin (BSA) or BSA‐bound palmitate for 24 h. Palmitate is a fatty acid containing 16 carbon atoms and a substrate for mitochondrial fatty‐acid oxidation. Control organoids showed the presence of MCAD protein, both with and without palmitate. In contrast, MCAD was not detectable in organoids from MCADD patients, in either stimulated or unstimulated conditions (Figure2A), in line with the fact that the c.985A>G (p.K329E) variant destabilizes the protein [34]. Addition of palmitate in the supernatant for 24 h led to a substantial accumulation of triglycerides (TGs) in the organoids. However, no significant difference was observed between control and the MCADD organoids (Figure2B).

Lower panel: Medium‐chain acylcarnitine measured in supernatant (C6, C8, and C10) and C8/C10 ratio. Data represents six biological replicates from independent cultures ± SEM (*p< 0.05, **p< 0.01, ***p< 0.001, ****p< 0.0001, one‐tailed unpairedttest).

The oxygen consumption rates with octanoyl‐carnitine (C8‐acylcarnitine) as the substrate were in the same range as those reported for primary‐tissue‐derived organoids [35] and the hepatocyte cell line HepG2 [28] (Figure2C). C8‐acylcarnitine is taken up by cells and imported into mitochondria, where it is converted to octanyl‐CoA (C8‐acyl‐CoA) by carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CTP2). C8‐acyl‐CoA is a direct substrate of MCAD. Surprisingly, however, the ability of permeabilized organoids to oxidize C8‐acylcarnitine in the presence of ADP and malate did not differ between control and MCADD organoids, nor did uncoupled respiration (Figure2C). One potential explanation is the overlapping substrate specificity of MCAD with the other dehydrogenases, SCAD (C4‐C6‐acyl‐CoA) and VLCAD (C8‐acyl‐CoA), which may partially compensate for the lack of MCAD [28]. We explored this using a computational model of human mFAO [28], based on detailed enzyme kinetics for all enzymes involved. We simulated the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of control and MCADD livers when 0–25 μM C8‐acylcarnitine was provided as substrate (FigureS2). In the simulations, a maximum reduction of 30% in OCR was predicted in MCADD compared to the control (at 25 μM). A detailed analysis of the acyl‐CoA dehydrogenation partitioning over the enzymes in the model shows that VLCAD oxidizes C8‐acyl‐CoA, while SCAD takes over C6‐acyl‐CoA oxidation in the absence of MCAD activity (FigureS2). Thus, under the simulated conditions, SCAD and VLCAD would be able to significantly compensate for the lack of MCAD, sustaining the OCR.

Next, we quantified the carnitine profile of the organoids to assess the activation of the mitochondrial fatty‐acid oxidation and analyze the accumulation of medium‐chain acyl‐carnitines, characteristic of MCADD patients. Control and MCADD organoids were incubated with palmitate and L‐carnitine for 24 h and the acyl‐carnitine profile was assessed both intracellularly and in the supernatant. While no changes were observed in short‐ and long‐chain acyl‐carnitines (FigureS3), MCADD organoids accumulated medium‐chain acyl‐carnitines with 6 to 10 carbon atoms (C6, C8, and C10 in Figure2C,D). Moreover, intracellularly the C8/C10 ratio, an important diagnostic biomarker of MCADD in clinical practice [1], was strongly increased in MCADD organoids (from 11 to 20) (Figure2D). The same pattern was observed in the supernatant where the C8/10 ratio was upregulated from 6 to 8 (Figure2D). The values are in the same range as those observed in the plasma of severe MCADD patients (median 13.1), whereas mild MCADD patients (≥ 10% residual MCAD activity) had a median C8/10 ratio of 3.10 and healthy controls 0.8 [1].

Although peroxisomes are specialized in their ability to oxidize very‐long‐chain, branched, and dicarboxylic fatty acids, they are also capable of oxidizing medium‐chain acyl‐CoA. Given the indications of a higher number of peroxisomes in hepatic cells [35], we decided to first further differentiate the EHOs into mature EHOs (Mat‐EHOs) in order to stimulate peroxisome proliferation.

EHOs were kept in expansion medium (EM) for 4–5 days after passage and then transferred to maturation medium (MM) (Figure3A). Maturation medium contains different cytokines that allow the EHOs to mature into a more hepatocyte‐like state. EHOs in MM underwent morphological changes, shrinking in size and developing thicker outer edges (Figure3B). Maturation was confirmed by upregulation of mature hepatocyte markersHNF4‐α,AFP, Albumin, andCYP2C9. Matured organoids also showed lower expression of cholangiocyte markersTBX3andCK19. Moreover, genes coding for enzymes involved in peroxisomal fatty‐acid oxidation (ABCD1,ACOX1, andCROT) were significantly upregulated (Figure3C). Finally, Mat‐EHOs secreted higher levels of albumin into the supernatant than EHOs, in line with a more hepatocyte‐like phenotype (Figure3D).

Depending on their chain lengths, fatty acids are β‐oxidized either in the mitochondria or in the peroxisomes [36]. In FAODs excess fatty acids can be channeled into ω‐oxidation, producing fatty dicarboxylic acids (DCAs) as end products, which are subsequently β‐oxidized in the peroxisomes (Figure4A) [36]. We investigated if fatty acid ω‐oxidation and mitochondrial and peroxisomal β‐oxidation pathways were regulated in response to loss of MCAD protein (Figure4B–D). Several genes encoding mitochondrial β‐oxidation enzymes were downregulated in the MCADD Mat‐EHOs relative to controls, including medium‐chain ketoacyl‐CoA thiolase (MCKAT) (encoded byACAA2), hydroxyacyl‐coenzyme A dehydrogenase (M/SCHAD) (encoded byHADH) and carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier protein (CACT) (encoded bySLC25A20) (Figure4B). Given the ability of peroxisomes to oxidize MCFA, it has been hypothesized that in the absence of MCAD, excess medium‐chain acyl‐CoAs can also be channeled to peroxisomes, where they undergo further β‐oxidation until C6‐acyl‐CoA, which may be shuttled back into the mitochondria to be oxidized by SCAD [29] (Figure4A). For the peroxisomal β‐oxidation, the genes encoding for the transporters ABCD1 and ABCD3 (ATP binding cassette transporter subfamily D;ABCD1andABCD3), the oxidase ACOX1 (acyl‐CoA oxidase 1;ACOX1), DBP and LBP (D‐bifunctional protein and L‐bifunctional protein;HSD17B4andEHHDAH, respectively) and the thiolases ACAA1 and SCPx (ACAA1andSCP2, respectively) were evaluated (Figure4C). Apart from a non‐significant decline inACOX1expression, the expression of other genes was not significantly changed in MCADD organoids. Lastly, we assessed ω‐oxidation and found that the genes encoding the enzymes cytochrome P450 family 4 subfamily F member 2 (CYP4F2) and alcohol dehydrogenase 4 (ADH4), which are involved in the ω‐oxidation of long‐chain fatty acids [37,38], were downregulated in the MCADD Mat‐EHOs compared to controls (Figure4D). A similar pattern was observed in the EHOs (FigureS4a).

In conclusion, all the observed adaptations showed downregulation, rather than upregulation of putative compensatory pathways.

Subsequently, we assessed the functionality of the mitochondrial fatty‐acid β‐oxidation in the Mat‐EHOs by high‐resolution respirometry and acylcarnitine profiling (Figure5). To mimic the fasting conditions, which often trigger symptoms in MCADD patients, we exposed the Mat‐EHO organoids to glucose‐free medium in the presence of BSA‐palmitate and carnitine. A recent study has reported that octanoate (C8‐FFA) is primarily activated to C8‐acyl‐CoA by acyl‐CoA synthetase medium‐chain (ACSM) in the liver, bypassing the carnitine shuttle [39] (TableS3). As C8‐acyl‐CoA is the main substrate of MCAD, we tested both C8‐acylcarnitine and C8‐FFA as substrates in the respirometry assay (Figure5A,B). The expression ofACSMwas also assessed in the Mat‐EHOs, showing a downward trend in the MCADD organoids compared to controls, albeit not significant (Figure5C). Surprisingly, permeabilized MCADD Mat‐EHOs displayed a higher OCR than the controls in almost all conditions (Figure5A,B). This difference was already observed at baseline and in the presence of malate and ADP, before the addition of fatty acids. Contrary to initial expectations, the OCR of both control and MCADD Mat‐EHOs did not change in response to the addition of either C8‐acylcarnitine or C8‐FFA (Figure5A,B), which indicated that mFAO was not the main process controlling the OCR. As the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) can influence the OCR through the generation and O2respiration–coupled oxidation of the electron carriers NADH and FADH2, respectively, we investigated whether these processes were regulated in MCADD Mat‐EHOs. First, we assessed the expression of genes encoding the TCA enzymes, citrate synthase (CS), malate dehydrogenase (MDH2) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHA1) (Figure5C). Consistent with the higher OCR observed in the presence of malate, MCADD Mat‐EHOs also showed upregulation ofMDH2compared to controls. Subsequently, we assessed the levels of mitochondrial complexes II, III, IV, and V involved in OXPHOS, but no significant differences were detected between MCADD and control Mat‐EHOs (Figure5D,E). Altogether, our data suggest that the TCA cycle, rather than mFAO, is the main process controlling the OCR in the Mat‐EHOs, and it appears to be upregulated in MCADD compared to controls. Lastly, we quantified the DCA and acylcarnitine profiles of MCADD and control Mat‐EHOs. Unfortunately, the DCA levels were below detection limit. Again, similar to the biochemical phenotype in MCADD patients, medium‐chain acyl‐carnitines accumulated in MCADD and the ratio C8/C10 was strongly elevated (Figure5F). Interestingly, and unlike in the EHOs, in Mat‐EHOs short‐chain acyl‐carnitine (C2) and long‐chain myristoyl‐carnitine (C14) were decreased (Figure5F). In agreement with the changes observed in the acyl‐carnitine profile, a recentin silicostudy, based on a detailed kinetic model of human fatty‐acid oxidation, predicted decreased levels of short‐chain and C12‐14 acyl‐CoA and acyl‐carnitines in MCADD [28]. Such decrease has been suggested to be caused by a concomitant depletion in the free coenzyme A (CoASH) levels and, consequently, reduced entry of long‐chain fatty acids into the pathway [28,40].



Functional characterization of the mitochondrial β‐oxidation in MCADD and control Mat‐EHOs. Mat‐EHOs were grown in glucose‐free medium supplemented with BSA‐palmitate or L‐carnitine. (A) Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in organoids measured at baseline, stimulated with malate, ADP and C8‐acylcarnitine (added in steps), and at uncoupled state (FCCP). (B) OCR in organoids measured at baseline, stimulated with malate, ADP and C8‐FFA (added in steps), and at uncoupled state (FCCP). For A, B, data represents the mean of 5–6 biological replicates ± SEM (Two‐way repeated measures ANOVA, followed by Šídák's multiple comparisons test). (C) Relative gene expression of acyl‐CoA synthetase medium‐chain (ACSM) and genes involved in the TCA cycle in Mat‐EHOs. The same analysis was performed in EHOs (FigureS4b,c). ForMDH2, one‐tailed unpairedt‐test was applied (*p< 0.05), as we had a specific hypothesis regarding the direction of the effect based on the data obtained in (A, B). (D) Immunoblot images of OXPHOS complexes II, III, IV and V. (E) Quantification of data shown in (D). For C–E, Mat‐EHO organoids were grown in glucose‐free medium supplemented with BSA and L‐carnitine. (F) Acyl‐carnitines measured in supernatant collected after 24 h in glucose‐free medium supplemented with BSA‐palmitate and L‐carnitine. For C–F, data represents four to six biological replicates ± SEM (*p< 0.05, two‐tailed unpairedttest); control (grey) and MCADD (red).

CoA is an essential intracellular cofactor involved in several metabolic pathways, and its level is dynamically regulated to adjust to the metabolic state through biosynthesis and turnover [41] (Figure6A). Furthermore, CoASH as well as acyl‐CoA and acylcarnitine esters have been reported to allosterically regulate the enzymatic activity of pantothenate kinase (PANK), the first enzyme in the CoA biosynthetic pathway [42,43,44]. Considering the changes observed in the acylcarnitine profile of MCADD Mat‐EHOs, we interrogated its potential effect on the CoA biosynthesis pathway and total CoA pool.

For C–F, organoids were grown in glucose‐free medium supplemented with BSA and L‐carnitine. Data represents seven biological replicates for the control group and five for MCADD ± SEM (*p< 0.05, **p< 0.01, two‐tailed unpairedttest).

The total CoA pool (free CoA plus acyl‐CoA) did not differ between MCADD and control Mat‐EHOs (Figure6B). CoA biosynthesis occurs partly in the cytosol and partly in the mitochondria (Figure6A).PANK2, encoding the mitochondrial PANK paralog, was slightly, but significantly, downregulated in the MCADD organoids (Figure6C). In addition to CoA biosynthesis, carnitine acyl‐transferases and acyl‐thioesterases (ACOT) also modulate the size of the CoA and acyl‐CoA pools in different intracellular compartments. Peroxisomes also contain several enzymes involved in CoA recycling (Figure6A), among them two acyl‐thioesterases (ACOT4 and ACOT8), and two carnitine acyl‐transferases: carnitine octanoyl‐transferase (CROT) and carnitine acetyl‐transferase (CRAT), in charge of converting Acyl‐CoAs into their respective acyl‐carnitine form, with the concomitant release of free CoA. MCADD organoids showed substantially lowerCROTandCRATexpression than healthy controls (Figure6D).NUDT7, a gene that encodes a peroxisomal Nudix hydrolase, which hydrolyzes CoA and acyl‐CoA species into 4′pantotheine and acyl‐4′‐pantotheine [45,46] and plays a role in the metabolism of dicarboxylic acids [32,47] was clearly upreg in MCADD organoids (Figure6D, FigureS4d). Finally, we assessed whether the changes in gene expression were reflected in the protein level (Figure6e,F). Consistent with the mRNA pattern (Figure6D) and the reduced levels of C2‐acylcarnitine (Figure5F), CRAT was found to be downregulated in MCADD Mat‐EHOs compared to controls. However, CROT and NUDT7 protein levels showed no differences between the groups.

Taken together, we observe a regulation of some genes involved in CoA metabolism, but an obvious compensatory response could not be identified.

In this paper we have established a patient‐specific iPSC‐derived hepatic organoid system for the study of MCADD. These organoids recapitulated the metabolic profile with high levels of medium‐chain acyl‐carnitines and an elevated C8/C10 ratio that is typical of severe MCADD patients. Furthermore, the Mat‐EHOs expressed pathways that are relevant for future studies of the pathophysiology of the disease. It may not be surprising that we observed only minor adaptations in putative compensatory pathways, since the MCADD organoids were derived from symptomatic patients. Compensatory pathways would rather be expected to be more pronounced in asymptomatic patients. Additionally, catabolic stressors (e.g., glucose starvation, intercurrent infection) in the organoids could have exacerbated the phenotype, given their importance in the manifestation of symptoms in MCADD patients. Nevertheless, we observed minor but notable differences between MCADD organoids and controls in CoA metabolism and the TCA cycle, as evidenced by reduced levels of C14‐acyl‐carnitine, upregulation ofNUDT7andMDH2, and increased OCR in MCADD.

Discovery of organoids in 2009 [16] revolutionized the field of biomedical research, providing an alternative to traditional primary hepatocytes. Recent work has focused on the development of organoids from iPSCs. iPSC‐derived hepatobiliary organoids have often been described as close to fetal tissue [25], and advancing their maturity levels to that of liver tissue remains a challenge. Here we compared different maturation stages of the organoids for the study of MCADD. While the original protocol uses a 3‐step procedure that relies on spontaneous aggregation of hepatic single cells [20], we found that this step was hard to reproduce and did not yield enough biomass for metabolic readouts. Therefore, for the purpose of our study, EHOs were matured to Mat‐EHOs (equivalent of “pre‐maturation” stage in the reference paper [20]). At this stage, Mat‐EHOs were found to already exhibit liver‐like phenotypes such as typical hepatocyte mRNA markers, albumin and urea secretion, and the presence of functional mitochondria and peroxisomes.

Despite the functional mitochondrial fatty‐acid β‐oxidation in the generated EHOs and Mat‐EHOs, evidenced by the acylcarnitine profile, these organoids seem to present a great reliance on glucose oxidation. This observation is supported by the respirometry assays, in which neither control nor MCADD Mat‐EHOs responded to the addition of mFAO substrates (C8‐acylcarnitine and C8‐FFA). In other words, the measured OCR was not driven by mFAO but sustained by malate, ADP, and another substrate providing acetyl‐CoA to the TCA cycle. Surprisingly, MCADD Mat‐EHOs even exhibited a higher OCR than controls, which may be explained by an increased TCA cycle flux, consistent with their low dependence on mFAO and the upregulation ofMDH2in the MCADD organoids. Increased glucose oxidation via glycogenolysis and the TCA cycle, or amino‐acid oxidation, could represent a compensatory mechanism in the MCADD organoids. However, further investigation is needed to test this hypothesis, such as analyzing substrate and protein levels, enzymatic activity, and/or directly assessing metabolic fluxes in the organoids. These observations contrast with previous reports by Lim [48] and Odendaal & Jager [28], who observed a reduced OCR in MCADD fibroblasts (in the presence of glucose) and MCAD‐KO HepG2 cells (in the presence of C16‐acylcarnitine), respectively. Interestingly, in the first study, the reduced OCR was associated with decreased levels of OXPHOS complexes in MCADD fibroblasts [48]. It should be noted that the MCADD fibroblasts described by Lim were obtained from patients carrying differentACADMvariants than the one described in this study (c.985A>G). Regarding in vivo data, a recent study investigating potential compensatory mechanisms in MCADD found no differences in the mitochondrial OCR with any substrate (pyruvate, C8‐ and C16‐acylcarnitine) nor regulation of the TCA cycle in MCAD‐KO mice treated with low‐ and high‐fat diets [10]. It is unclear, however, if this can be translated to the human situation, since rodents present an additional dehydrogenase, LCAD, which may compensate for the lack of MCAD.

Despite the counterintuitive OCR data, both MCADD EHOs and Mat‐EHOs showed accumulation of medium‐chain acyl‐carnitines (C6‐C10), recapitulating a major biochemical phenotype and confirming active fatty‐acid oxidation. Interestingly, only MCADD Mat‐EHO organoids presented reduced levels of short‐ and long‐chain acyl‐carnitine relative to their control counterparts. These changes are in line with a recent in silico study from our group, based on a detailed computational model of the fatty‐acid oxidation, which predicted reduced levels of short‐ and long‐chain acyl‐CoAs and their corresponding acyl‐carnitines in MCADD [28]. Decreased short‐chain acyl‐CoA or acyl‐carnitine levels are not surprising, since they are downstream of the deficient MCAD enzyme. C14, however, is upstream of MCAD, and at first sight it might therefore be expected to be elevated or unchanged. In the computational model, the reduced C14‐acyl‐CoA could be attributed to a limitation of CoASH availability. CoASH was sequestered into medium‐chain acyl‐CoAs, which strongly accumulated in MCADD. The decrease of free CoA, in turn, limited the entry of new long‐chain fatty acids into the mFAO pathway [28,40] and thereby led to a reduced C14‐acyl‐CoA. While our data provide experimental support of this non‐intuitive computational prediction, the CoASH availability and its role in the pathophysiology of MCADD warrant further investigation.

Together these data suggest that the maturation step into Mat‐EHO organoids, accompanied by peroxisome and mitochondrial enrichment and a representative acylcarnitine profile, is a relevant step to study the pathophysiological mechanisms of MCADD.

While peroxisomes have been reported to oxidize MCFAs [29], we did not observe any regulation of peroxisomal enzymes involved in the import and oxidation of fatty acids in MCADD organoids, which suggests this pathway was not further activated.

In addition to the oxidation of fatty acids, peroxisomes play a central role in the oxidation of dicarboxylic fatty acids (DCA) [49]. Under high fatty acid (FA) supply, such as fasting and mFAO disorders, excess FAs are channeled to DCA via ω‐oxidation [50,51]. In MCADD, patients in metabolic crisis have been reported to exhibit accumulation of medium‐chain dicarboxylic fatty acids (MC‐DCA) and high excretion in urine [52,53]. Excess DCAs can be metabolized by the peroxisomal β‐oxidation [49,54] or via the activity of nudix hydrolase 7 (NUDT7) [32,47]. Herewith, the expression of peroxisomal ABCD3 transporter and LBP, both playing major roles in DCA oxidation [55], was not regulated in the MCADD organoids. Zooming into the ω‐oxidation, we confirmed the expression of genes encoding relevant enzymes in the pathway in both EHOs and Mat‐EHOs. Unfortunately, dicarboxylic fatty acids could not be detected in the organoids nor in the supernatant, which may indicate dysfunctional ω‐oxidation or the lack of sensitivity of the chosen method to detect very low concentrations of metabolites.

DCA accumulation in the liver can be toxic, causing inflammation, fibrosis, and death [56]. Recent animal studies suggest that Nudt7 contributes to the regulation of dicarboxylic fatty acid metabolism in the liver [32,47]. Male mice lacking Nudt7 (Nudt7 −/−) exposed to high‐fat diet showed accumulation of MC‐DCA [32]. The authors proposed a major role of NUDT7 in the regulation of the levels of MC‐DCA. Therefore, we hypothesized that the upregulation in NUDT7 expression in the MCADD organoids may play a role in mitigating and preventing excessive accumulation of MC‐DCA that otherwise could be toxic [56]. However, the change in gene expression was not reflected at the protein level, potentially due to the absence or low levels of DCA in these organoids. Nevertheless, the consistent upregulation ofNUDT7in both MCADD EHOs and Mat‐EHOs warrants further investigation in vivo.

In conclusion, the Mat‐EHO organoids derived from iPSCs of severe MCADD patients show a biochemical phenotype that is characteristic of these patients and provide a good basis for future mechanistic studies into patient‐to‐patient variability. For instance, they can be used to assess the phenotype of genetic variants of theACADMgene that give rise to different residual activities. More interestingly, they can be used to study putative compensatory pathways in asymptomatic patients with a classical c.985A>G and zero residual MCAD activity, for example, in participants of the Fasting Tolerance in MCADD‐infants (FiTtINg MCADD) study (NCT03761693). Furthermore, nutritional interventions and different stressors can be modulated in vitro to study liver‐specific aspects of MCADD pathophysiology and potential therapeutic interventions.

Fibroblasts from patients without documented heritable metabolic diseases (n= 2) and also from symptomatic patients with MCADD carrying the classical c.985A>G missense mutation (n= 2) were obtained from the Department of Genetics of the University Medical Center Groningen. Patients 5 and 8, previously described in the literature [28], were chosen for this study because of their classical mutation, symptomatology, and normal growth of fibroblasts. Control fibroblasts from C104 and C105 were also described in the literature [28]. All patients were born prior to the implementation of the neonatal MCADD screening in the Netherlands (2007). Both MCADD patients were symptomatic, suffered at least one recorded metabolic crisis, resulting in hospitalization with hypoglycaemia (< 2.6 mmol/L), coma, and/or seizures.

Fibroblasts were cultured in Ham's F‐10 Nutrient Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific 11550043), supplemented with 10% FCS (Gibco) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco).

Human fibroblasts were reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells following the previously published protocol [33]. iPSCs were cultured in Matrigel (Corning)‐coated plates in mTeSR Plus medium (STEMCELL Technologies). Cells were passaged every 4–6 days, and medium was changed every other day.

iPSCs were differentiated into expandable hepatic organoids (EHOs) following the previously published protocols for hESCs [20,57] with some adaptations. iPSC cells were cultured in Matrigel‐coated plates and placed in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 1× B27‐Supplement (Invitrogen), 100 ng/mL Activin A (Peprotech), and 30% Wnt3a‐conditioned medium (kindly provided by Hans Clevers). Wnt3aCM was removed after 24 h, and cells were kept in the same medium supplemented with 100 ng/mL Activin A and 2× B27‐supplement for 48 h. The cells were then transferred to Hepatocyte Culture Medium (HCM) (Lonza, CC‐3198) without EGF and supplemented with 20 ng/mL BMP4 and 10 ng/mL FGF2 (both Peprotech) for the next 5 days. After 5 days, the cells were dissociated using 0.25% Trypsin–EDTA and embedded in BME domes (5000–10 000 cells per 50 μL dome) in Corning 24‐well plates. The cells were cultured in an expansion medium (expansion medium) containing Ad. DMEM/F12 (Gibco) supplemented with 1× Glutamax, 1× HEPES, P/S (all Gibco), 1× B‐27 Supplement, 1× N‐2 Supplement (all Invitrogen), 10 mM Nicotinamide (Sigma Aldrich), 1.25 mM N‐acetylcysteine (Sigma Adlrich), 50 ng/mL EGF (Peprotech), 10uM Forskolin (TOCRIS), 10 nM Iso‐leu gastrin (Sigma Aldrich), 30% Rspon1‐CM (Kindly provided by Calvin J. Kuo) and 10% Wnt‐3a CM.

Medium was changed every 2–3 days. Organoids were passaged every 7–9 days by manually disrupting the BME domes and split in a ratio of 1:8–1:10 depending on the line and supplemented with 10 μM Y 27632 dihydrochloride (Axon Medchem) for 2 days after passaging.

Expandable hepatic organoids were matured into hepatocyte‐like EHOs (Mat‐EHOs) following the previously published protocol [20]. Organoids were kept in expansion medium for 4–6 days after passage and then placed in maturation medium (MM) containing Ad. DMEM/F12 supplemented with 1× Glutamax, 1× HEPES, P/S, 1× B‐27 Supplement, 1× N‐2 Supplement, 10 mM Nicotinamide, 1.25 mM N‐acetylcysteine, 10 nM Iso‐leu gastrin, 50 ng/mL HGF, 25 ng/mL BMP7, and 25 ng/mL FGF4 (all growth factors from Peprotech). Organoids were kept in maturation medium for 4 days prior to collection for downstream analysis.

For brightfield imaging, organoids were imaged using an AxioObserver Z1 compound microscope (Carl Zeiss), 2.5× and 5× objectives, and an AxioCam MRm3 CCD camera (Carl Zeiss).

For immunofluorescence images, organoids were processed following the previously published protocol [58]. After collection with ice‐cold Ad. DMEM/F12, the organoids were kept on ice for 10 min to ensure BME degradation. After centrifugation at 80G at 4°C, the organoids were reconstituted in 4% PFA and kept at 4C for 45 min. After fixation, organoids were permeabilized using PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and kept in that buffer for 2 days. Primary and secondary antibody incubations were performed in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.2% BSA. Primary and secondary antibodies are listed in TableS2. Organoids were imaged using an ImageXpress Micro Confocal High‐Content Imaging System (Molecular devices) with a 20× water‐immersion objective (molecular devices). Fifty slices with a 2 μm step size were acquired for each wavelength. Image processing was performed using Fiji v1.8.0.

RNA was isolated from the organoids using RNase easy Kit (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer. NanoDrop (NanoDrop Technologies) was used to assess the quality and yield of total RNA. M‐MLV Reverse Transcriptase (200 U/μl) (Invitrogen) was used to perform reverse transcription as established by the manufacturer. qPCR was performed in 384‐well format in duplicates (5–10 ng per well) using FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master (Rox) (Sigmal Aldrich) using QuantStudio 7 Flex (Thermo Fischer Scientific). All primer (Integrated DNA technologies Inc) sequences are listed in TableS1. β‐Actin served as endogenous control and was used for normalization.

For albumin measurements, the supernatant was collected after 24 h. Levels of albumin in the supernatant were measured with the human albumin ELISA kit (Abcam) as described by the manufacturer using the Synergy H4 Hybrid Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments Inc).

Urea secretion was assessed in the organoid supernatant using the QuantiChrom Urea kit as described by the manufacturer.

All results were normalized to protein content.

The protocol followed for immunoblotting was slightly modified from a previously published paper [59]. Organoids were collected using ice‐cold Ad. DMEM/F12 and kept on ice for 10 min to degrade the BME. Organoids were then centrifuged at290 gfor 5 min at 4°C and washed with cold PBS prior to another centrifugation step. After the second centrifugation, the organoids were reconstituted in radio immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing 1% IGEPAL CA‐630, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate in PBS. RIPA buffer was supplemented with Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail 2 (Cat. No. P5726) and Cocktail 3 (Cat. No. P0044) and Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Cat. No. 1186145001) (All Sigma Aldrich). Sonics Vibra cell VCX130 (Sonics & Materials Inc.) was used to sonicate organoid lysates using 4 pulses of 10 s on, 30 s off at an amplitude of 30%. Lysates were then centrifuged at 12 000 rcf for 10 min at 4°C to ensure the precipitation of cell debris. Protein content was determined using Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (ThermoScientific) and all samples were adjusted to the lowest concentration value. Lysates were adjusted with Laemmli loading buffer (5×: 60 mM Tris‐Cl pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 1% SDS, 0.05% Bromophenol Blue, 1% beta‐mercaptoethanol). Protein separation was done in SDS‐PAGE 10%–14% using a Mini PROTEAN Tetra Vertical Electrophoresis Cell system (Bio‐Rad, 1658029FC). For western blot, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon‐P, Millipore).

Organoids were collected in 1× TBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 66 mM Tris, pH 7.4) in MiliQ water. Fat was extracted in chloroform: methanol in a ratio of 2:1. The levels of hepatic triglycerides were quantitatively determined using the DiaSys Triglyceride FS kit (Holzheim). Results were normalized to protein content.

Organoids were collected at Days 8–10 using ice‐cold Ad. DMEM/12 and kept on ice for 10 min. Organoids were then centrifuged at290 gat 4°C for 5 min and washed with 2 mL of MiR05 buffer, followed by another spin and finally reconstituted in 600uL of MiR05 buffer, containing 110 mM sucrose, 60 mM potassium lactobionate, 20 mM taurine, 20 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM EGTA, 10 mM KH2PO4, 3 mM MgCl2, and 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, at pH 7.1.

Oxygen consumption rate was measured in the organoids using a two‐channel high‐resolution Oroboros Oxygraph‐2k (Oroboros). Organoids were first permeabilized by addition of digitonin (0.02 mg/mL). The maximal coupled respiration was measured in the presence of 1 mM ADP, 25 μM octanoyl‐carnitine, and 2 mM malate (state 3). Basal respiration was determined by the subsequent addition of 0.002 mg/mL of oligomycin to block ATP synthase (state 4). Finally, uncoupled respiration (state U) was measured after subsequent administration of 1.5 μM carbonyl cyanide p‐(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP). Oxygen consumption rates were normalized to protein concentration.

EHO organoids were incubated with 0.5 mM BSA‐conjugated palmitate (Sigma‐Aldrich, P9767) and 2 mM l‐carnitine (Sigma Aldrich) for 24 h prior to collection in PBS. Acylcarnitines were measured both in supernatant and intracellularly following the published protocol [60].

Mat‐EHO organoids were incubated in glucose‐free maturation medium supplemented with 0.5 mM BSA‐conjugated palmitate and 2 mM l‐carnitine for 24 h. Organoids were collected in ice‐cold medium and washed 2× in ice‐cold PBS. Samples were prepared as described elsewhere [61]. Briefly, the pellet was reconstituted in 600 μL MilliQ H2O, and the lysate was sonicated using a Sonics Vibra cell VCX130 (25 s, 50% amplitude, two times). Lysates were centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. In a new tube, 80 μL Tris (2‐carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (10 mM) was added to 400 μL supernatant and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Next, samples were spun down (14 000 rpm, 15 min, 4°C). In a new tube, 40 μL ammonia solution was added to 400 μL supernatant (1.25% v/v) and incubated shaking at 500 rpm at 60°C for 60 min. Lastly, samples were dried using a SpeedVac (Eppendorf) and reconstituted in 100 μL ice‐cold 80% methanol.

Coenzyme A was extracted by a two‐step protocol using chloroform/methanol/water based on the Bligh and Dyer approach [62]. The detailed sample preparation and HILIC‐MS/MS protocol are described in detail in the literature [63].

PCLS with approximately 250–300 μM thickness were prepared using a Krumdieck Tissue Slicer (Alabama Research and Development), as described elsewhere. Individual slices were kept in culture for 24 h in Williams E medium (WE), containing 25 mM glucose, 0.5% BSA, 1 mM l‐carnitine, and gentamycin (Invitrogen). The plates were kept under a continuous supply of 80% O2/5% CO2, shaking at 70 rpm.

Human liver tissue was collected from a transplantation donor at the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG, Netherlands). The liver was used for research purposes after being rejected for transplantation with the approval of the Research Ethics Committee of UMCG.

All results are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism Software Version 9.02 (Graphpad Software). Statistical significance was determined as *pvalue < 0.5, **pvalue < 0.01, and ***pvalue < 0.001; no indication means no significant changes (ns). For iPSC work, biological replicates are considered individual donors. For organoid work, due to the low number of patients, biological replicates are considered organoids coming from the two same patients or healthy controls that were at least one passage apart.

Existent research examining perceptions of nicotine addiction use largely surface level items that fail to address the complexity of nicotine addiction. Additional investigation is needed to better understand people’s perceptions of nicotine addiction and whether these align with measures of nicotine dependence. Understanding these perceptions about nicotine addiction may help provide insight into vaping intentions and behavior. This study examines the validity of the Nicotine Addiction Perceptions (NAP) scale, a novel measure designed to assess perceptions of addictive vaping behavior that aligns with the clinical dimensions of tobacco use disorder.

Data were collected from U.S. adults via Prolific (n = 549). As part of scale development and validation a confirmatory factor analysis and psychometric evaluation was conducted. The NAP’s reliability, convergent, discriminant, and criterion validity were established.

A five-factor solution returned acceptable fit on all model indices (RMSEA = 0.050; CFI = 0.994; TLI = 0.993). The NAP was significantly related to assessments of perceived risk, 6 month quit intentions, the number of quit intentions over the past year, and past 30-day e-cigarette use (P’s< .05). Findings also indicate support for discriminant validity.

Findings suggest that for most, perceptions of nicotine addiction may not fully align with the clinical criteria of addiction, which may be due to the lack of education surrounding the clinical definition. Future research examining perceptions of nicotine addiction can utilize the NAP scale to better understand people’s understanding of addiction and its relationship to vaping-related behavior.

Prevalence of tobacco use remains problematic1and is one of the most common addictions.2-4In a nationally representative sample of United States (U.S.) adults who smoke (n = 6793), 85% of daily smokers and 44% of non-daily smokers met the diagnostic criteria of addiction.5Faced with declining cigarette consumption as a result of tobacco control measures, tobacco companies are increasingly promoting alternative methods of nicotine consumption, such as electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes).6,7These products are presented as “risk reductive” primarily because they are reported to allow a consumer to avoid negative consequences of combustion which includes inhalation of particles and hydrocarbons that can cause severe tissue damage.8However, these alternative tobacco products – which still contain nicotine – have been shown to hold their own health risks including increased risk of damaged lung function, heart disease, and cancer9related to the ingestion of heavy metals and aerosols, volatile organic compounds, and toxic flavorings,10,11and do not reduce the harm of nicotine addiction itself.9,11

In a nationally representative sample of approximately 30 000 U.S. adults, 6.5% reported current use of e-cigarettes in 2023.12Initially touted as a cessation tool for combustible cigarette users,13e-cigarette use has permeated into other groups, including people who have never used combustible cigarettes.14-16Given the changing landscape of tobacco products over the past decade, it is probable that cigarette use may no longer be the only major prototype of nicotine consumption, and that vaping may complement cigarette use.13

Single item assessments of perceptions of nicotine addiction are highly varied between researchers.17Much of this work typically uses one comparative item that assesses perceived addictiveness of e-cigarettes relative to combustible cigarettes, despite the addictive component of all tobacco products being nicotine.18,19Thus, it is difficult to meaningfully understand how people perceive nicotine addiction to e-cigarettes as this measure is dependent upon the measure of perceived cigarette addiction. Even in cases where item phrasing may be identical, response options given to participants vary across studies and the lack of standardization of this construct hinders replicability and contributes to the cursory understanding researchers have developed when assessing perceptions of nicotine addiction.17Moreover, assessments of perceptions of nicotine addiction must be distinguished from diagnostic measures of nicotine addiction as the former assesses people’s beliefs surrounding addiction and the latter assesses addictive behavior.

Nicotine addiction, or dependence, has physical, psychological, and social elements, all of which can influence use and cessation.20Physical aspects of nicotine addiction can include impaired cognitive performance when deprived of nicotine or weight loss due to decreased appetite.21Research has also found that nicotine can cause permanent changes in the brain that can make the individual more dependent.22Nicotine provides reduction in anxiety and stress when in withdrawal, which can occur throughout the day for the smoker if they are not smoking frequently, and includes psychological symptoms such as anxiety or depressed mood.20Finally, social aspects of nicotine dependence can include increased positive social functioning while smoking, thus perpetuating dependence,23but poorer social interactions when abstaining.24For example, an established tobacco user may be asked to avoid smoking around others (eg, friends, loved ones, etc.) and may isolate themselves in order to continue smoking, reducing their social circle and negatively impacting their well-being. Using tobacco against one’s will is a clinically recognized aspect of addiction, yet despite this understanding, psychometric evaluation of people’s appraisal of nicotine addiction is lacking and scales that do exist fail to address the complexity of nicotine addiction.17To assess one’s susceptibility of becoming addicted to nicotine as well as their severity (ie, the strength of addiction were nicotine used), researchers must first understand how the lay person (ie, general public) appraises singular behaviors. For example, does the lay person think that the only sign of nicotine addiction is craving tobacco? Or is a sign of nicotine addiction a confluence of multiple behaviors, and if so, what are those behaviors? Concerns related to nicotine addiction among those with little to no experience with vaping may elucidate their reasoning behind initiating e-cigarettes. Similarly, understanding how an established e-cigarette user perceives addiction may help in tailoring cessation interventions (eg, highlighting dimensions of addiction that may not be as commonplace). This study aims to develop a scale that not only encapsulates the perceived breadth of experiences when addicted to nicotine, but also assesses the intensity of those experiences. By measuring perceptions of nicotine addiction in line with clinical dimensions, researchers can determine how perceptions of these dimensions of addiction contribute to health decision making – bothwhichdimensions contribute andhow muchthey contribute.

Assessments of nicotine addiction (ie, dependence) between clinicians and researchers are highly varied. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5thedition (DSM-5),25manifestation of tobacco use disorder (ie, addiction) involves experiencing at least two of 11 dimensions within a 12-month period, with more dimensions experienced equating to a more severe addiction. These 11 dimensions include: (1) consuming substance in larger amounts or over a longer period than intended, (2) a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to reduce or control substance use, (3) a great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain or use substance, (4) craving of substance, (5) recurrent substance use resulting in failure to fulfill major role obligations, (6) continued substance use despite persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the product, (7) important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of substance use, (8) recurrent substance use in physically hazardous conditions, (9) continued substance use despite knowledge and experience of psychological or physical harm associated with substance use, (10) tolerance of substance, and (11) withdrawal from substance. These dimensions can be largely categorized into either (1) behavioral changes, or (2) affective symptoms.

In contrast, researchers typically utilize scales such as the Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale (NDSS)26or the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND).27The FTND and NDSS are ubiquitous in psychological research, yet items found in these scales are not aligned with clinical guidelines, let alone each other. The FTND determines addiction severity based on items such as the amount of tobacco consumed per day and how quickly after waking one smokes. Conversely, the NDSS assesses addiction severity based on a host of items, including questions related to tolerance and reduced social activity in order to smoke. Though both scales have been validated to assess addiction severity in research settings, neither scale comprehensively aligns with clinical guidelines (ie, DSM-5). Moreover, there is no overlap in items between the NDSS and FTND, making it difficult to compare scores. The incongruencies in measurement of addiction severity and lack of emphasis on how peopleconceptualizenicotine addiction has led to a cursory understanding of what addiction means for the lay person.

To better understand addiction perceptions, the disentanglement of the physical, psychological, and social components of nicotine addiction are warranted. Specifically, when considering nicotine addiction, do people primarily focus on withdrawal symptoms, craving, or inability to quit smoking despite the social and economic costs? Understanding how the lay person views and thinks about nicotine addiction is instrumental in developing and refining current targeted interventions for both prevention and intervention-based research. Using a previously established scale development framework28and based on the clinical dimensions of tobacco use disorder, this study aimed to psychometrically evaluate and validate a novel scale.

In December 2023, participants were recruited using Prolific, an online survey platform comprised of active participants that have been screened and verified prior to participation.29The survey was hosted on Qualtrics30an online survey building platform. To be eligible for inclusion, participants were required to be ≥ 18 years old and English speakers living in the U.S. Both e-cigarette users and non-users were recruited to be in the study. Perceptions of nicotine addiction among both current and non-e-cigarette users can provide insight into their decision-making processes by highlighting the aspects of addiction most salient for them. For their participation, participants received $4.00 credit to their Prolific account. This study was deemed exempt by the University of California, Merced Institutional Review Board (UCM2023-28) as the research only involved interactions via survey procedures, and the information obtained is recorded by investigators in such a manner that the identity of human subjects cannot be readily ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects. Prior to the survey, participants received a written consent form that described the study, and denoted their consent to participate in the current study before moving onto the survey. This study was not preregistered.

To determine the minimum number of participants needed to test study hypotheses, an a-priori power analysis was run using G*power.31Informed by quantitative literature, we set power at .95 to reduce the likelihood of detecting erronenous significance based on small sample size,32and had a small effect size of 0.11 given that our power is relatively restrictive,33to which G*power recommends a total sample size of 253. Thus, the obtained sample of ne-cigarette users= 277 & nnon-e-cigarette users= 275, was adequate to test study hypotheses. After removing missing data (n = 3), the final sample for ne-cigarette users= 274.

Participants responded to 36 items assessing their perceptions of nicotine addiction (seeSupplemental Material 1) which was part of a larger survey assessing risk behavior (see Data Availability). In collaboration with an expert in tobacco control,34-36a new scale was developed, with each item created using the 11 DSM-5 dimensions of tobacco use disorder as a guiding framework. Before settling on a finalized version, the NAP scale directions and items underwent the cognitive interview process with a separate, independent sample to determine item comprehension and improve its readability. The cognitive interview sample were comprised of active e-cigarette users and non-users. In its finalized version, the prompt read, “Below we are going to give you a list of behaviors related to nicotine based vapes/e-cigarettes. On a scale from 1-5, how important are any of these behaviors in telling you a person is addicted to vapes/e-cigarettes?”. Participants indicated their perceptions of addiction to nicotine with items such as “Having difficulty with quitting vaping” and “Giving up hobbies in order to vape” on a five-point scale from 1 (not at all important) to 5 (extremely important).

To measure perceptions of e-cigarette harm to one’s own health, participants were asked, on a five-point Likert type scale with 1 = very unlikely and 5 = very likely, “If you continue to smoke e-cigarettes, how likely is it that you will harm your own health?”; non-users were asked, “If you were to smoke e-cigarettes, how likely is it that you will harm your own health?”. To measure perceptions of e-cigarette harm to other’s health, users were asked, on a five-point Likert type scale with 1 = very unlikely and 5 = very likely, “If you continue to smoke e-cigarettes, how likely is it that you will harm someone else’s health with second hand vape smoke?”; non-users were asked, “If you were to smoke e-cigarettes, how likely is it that you will harm someone else’s health with second hand vape smoke?”.

Adapted from previously validated items in the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study that have been shown to relate to smoking-related behavior,37participants were asked about comparative e-cigarette harm with the question, “Compared with cigarettes, how harmful are e-cigarettes to a person’s health”? Response options followed a Likert scale format from 1 = much less harmful than cigarettes to 5 = much more harmful than cigarettes. Perceptions of perceived e-cigarette addictiveness was assessed with the question “If you continue to smoke e-cigarettes, how likely is it that you will become addicted?”, response options were on five-point Likert type scale with 1 = very unlikely and 5 = very likely. Non-users were asked, “If you were to smoke e-cigarettes, how likely is it that you will become addicted?”.

The full sample consisted of adults who did not use an e-cigarette (non- e-cigarette user) and adults who actively used an e-cigarette (current e-cigarette user). Some non- e-cigarette users had tried an e-cigarette (but no more than 20 times in their lifetime; defined by Prolific and verified during the survey process). Participants classified as current e-cigarette users (defined as using an e-cigarette in the past 30 days), were also asked questions about their use and cessation-related behavior. Current e-cigarette users were asked to report the number of days they vaped in the past 30 days from 0 days to 30 days. This was separated into three categories (1 = 1-10 days, 2 = 11-24 days, 3 = 25 or more days). Participants were asked about nicotine dependence using the NDSS, a 19-item questionnaire previously validated,26where they indicated how well the following statements described them from 1 = not at all true to 5 = extremely true. Language for the scale was adapted for e-cigarette use (eg, “Whenever I go without vaping for a few hours, I experience craving”). Participants also answered questions from the FTND, a six-item instrument that has been previously validated and assesses the physical intensity of nicotine addiction using a summated score where 0-2 = low dependence, 3-4 = low to moderate dependence, 5-7 = moderate dependence, 8+ = high dependence.27Language for the scale was also adapted for e-cigarette use (eg, “Which vaping session would you hate most to give up”?). Current e-cigarette users were asked to report how soon they use their e-cigarette/vape after waking (1 = within 5 minutes, 2 = 5-30 minutes, 3 = 31-60 minutes, 4 = longer than 60 minutes) and how many times a day they used an e-cigarette device (0 = 0 times a day – 30 = 30 or more times a day). This was separated into three categories (1 = 1-9 times a day, 2 = 10-24 times a day, 3 = 25 or more times a day). The FTND was scored in line with established scoring guidelines.

E-cigarette users were asked their primary reason or motivation for using an e-cigarette (including non-e-cigarette users who had some experience using an e-cigarette).37Participants could only select one option which included: to quit smoking, to reduce smoking, to use when I cannot or am not allowed to smoke, enjoyment, or curiosity. Participants were asked whether their e-cigarette liquids contained nicotine (0 = no, 1 = yes; including non-e-cigarette users who had some experience using an e-cigarette). Finally, users were asked about their intentions to quit in the next 30 days and 6 months (0 = no, 1 = yes) and number of quit attempts in the past 12 months for at least 24 h (0 = no, 1 = yes). Additionally, participants were asked the number of times they’ve attempted to quit vaping in the past 12 months (0-12 or more).

Participants completed the PROMIS short-form anxiety and depression questionnaires, which have both been previously validated.38The PROMIS questionnaires utilize a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Depression and anxiety scores were highly correlated (Pearson’sr= 0.80), so we created a composite score by averaging depression and anxiety scores together. Higher scores indicated experiencing greater mental distress over the previous seven days.

Participants were asked demographic questions (gender, race/ethnicity, income, education, and age). Forgender,participants were considered male if they selected male or female-to-male transgender, and female if they selected female or male-to-female transgender. Other gender identities (non-binary or declined to answer) were not included in analyses due to low cell count (n = 14). Gender was dichotomized (males = 0, females = 1). Forrace/ethnicity, participants were either coded as non-Hispanic/Latinx (NH) White, NH African-American/Black, Hispanic/Latinx (Hispanic), or NH Other. Foreducation, respondents were either coded as having a high school degree or less, some college education, a Bachelor’s degree, or graduate degree.Incomewas categorized into five groups (<$25,000; $25,001-$50,000; $50,001-$75,000; $75,000- $100,000; $100,001+). Demographic characteristics of the sample can be found inSupplemental Material 2.

A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of the six-factor structure based on the team’s initial work developing this scale was conducted (seeSupplemental Material 3). Respondents with missing values were omitted from analysis (n = 3), after ensuring data were missing completely at random (P= 0.1099).39Final factor structure was dependent upon how well items loaded onto their respective factor and whether enough items loaded onto a single latent factor.40After assessing multivariate normality using Mardia’s test of normality, we utilized a mean- and variance-adjusted weighted least squares (WLSMV) estimation method which is preferred as its properties are less biased, there is small sampling variation in estimated factor loadings compared to other estimation methods,41,42and modification indices and associated values can be interpreted in the same manner as CFA with continuous data.43To allow factor loadings to be estimated freely, we fixed latent factor variance to one.

With rating scale data, item difficulty can be interpreted as the ease in which respondents can endorse a particular item, rather than the percentage of people who answer an item correctly.44Item discrimination refers to an item’s ability to distinguish between individuals with lower and higher scores on the latent construct, with higher scores indicating greater relevance of the item being measured by the latent trait.45,46Item removal was primarily dependent upon difficulty and discrimination scores. Given this is the first attempt at creating a scale to assess perceptions of nicotine addiction, we employed a more conservative approach to retaining items that were highly correlated (seeSupplemental Material 4). We assessed internal consistency of the NAP (ie, reliability) using McDonald’s omega (ω) and interpreted findings according to conventional guidelines: 0.9+ = excellent reliability, 0.8-0.9 = good reliability, 0.7-0.8 = acceptable reliability.47,48

We conducted Pearson’s correlations to assess convergent validity between perceived harm to health, harm to other’s health, likelihood of becoming addicted, comparative harm, and the NAP scale among all study participants. Additionally, we conducted Pearson’s correlations to assess discriminant validity between the NDSS, FTND, and NAP among active e-cigarette users. We conducted various regressions to assess criterion validity among active e-cigarette users. Specifically, we conducted binary logistic regressions to analyze 6-month and 30-day quit intentions, and whether a quit attempt had occurred over the past 12 months. Initial analyses for the number of quit attempts over the past 12 months indicated some non-normal data, particularly skewed to the right. To account for the over-dispersion and excess zero responses, we conducted a negative binomial regression in which the Incident Rate Ratio (IRR) refers to the factor change in the outcome variable for each unit increase in the predictor variable.49Finally, we conducted linear regressions to analyze how soon after waking one uses their e-cigarette, daily e-cigarette use, and past 30-day e-cigarette use. For all regression analyses, we controlled for comparative e-cigarette harm, current combustible cigarette user status (yes/no), nicotine dependence scores (NDSS), primary reason for using e-cigarettes, e-cigarette composition, mental health status, and demographic variables. Data were analyzed using Rstudio 2023.06.1.

In a general U.S. adult sample, the average age of participants was 39.56 years (SD = 12.66 years;Supplemental Material 2), and roughly half were male (51.37%). Most identified as NH White (62.48%). The most commonly reported reason for using an e-cigarette device was for enjoyment (29.4%), followed by curiosity (28.39%), to quit (19.6%) or reduce (14.82%) smoking, and for use when one cannot or is not allowed to smoke (6.03%). A majority of respondents reported using an e-cigarette that contained nicotine (76.84%).

In the current sample, the six-factor solution suggested acceptable model fit on CFA indices: χ2(284, N = 549) = 766.528,P< .001; robust Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) = 0.044 (scaled SRMR = 0.044; recommended good fit < 0.08), robust Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.036 (90% CI = 0.033, 0.039; scaled RMSEA = 0.056 (90% CI = 0.051, 0.060; recommended good fit ≤ 0.06), robust Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0.991 (scaled CFI = 0.794; recommended value ≥ 0.90), robust Tucker Lewis Index (TLI) = 0.989 (scaled TLI = 0.765; recommended value ≥ 0.90). Standardized item factor loadings can be found inTable 1.

Confirmatory Factor Analysis Item Loadings.

Note. Factor loadings are standardized.

After removing a problematic item, “Drinking less alcoholic beverages when they do not vape,” due to its poor factor loading (0.250) and removing Factor 6 entirely due to an insufficient number of items, we re-analyzed the CFA with a five-factor solution. This resulted in better model fit indices: χ2(220, N = 549) = 518.808,P< .001, robust SRMR = 0.041 (scaled SRMR = 0.041), robust RMSEA = 0.030 (95% CI = 0.026, 0.033; scaled RMSEA = 0.050, 95% CI = 0.044, 0.055), robust CFI = 0. 994 (scaled CFI = 0.854), robust TLI = 0.993 (scaled TLI = 0.832). Standardized item factor loadings can be found inTable 1, and a diagrammatic representation can be found inFigure 1.



Five Factor Solution Diagram.

For item difficulty, respondents were likely to endorse item 18 using higher response options (“Giving up part of their job because of vaping; seeTable 2), but less likely to endorse item seven (“Often thinking about reducing their vaping). In this regard, participants were likely to agree that item 18 is reflective of someone experiencing addiction. In contrast, participants were not likely to agree that item seven reflects an individual experiencing addiction. Item discrimination values ranged from 0.44 to 0.82 (seeTable 2). Items six, seven, and eight had the lowest discrimination scores that ranged from 0.44 to 0.50. These items comprise Factor 5, which was labeled “Consistent Desire to Quit/Reduce Use”. These results suggest that these items were not effective at differentiating between individuals who perceived these vaping behaviors as more indicative of addiction vs less indicative of addiction. The two items with the highest item discrimination were item 30 (0.82) and 17 (0.81), which comprised factors two (labeled “Withdrawal”) and four (labeled “Social Impact”), respectively. These items were effective in differentiating between individuals who perceive these vaping behaviors as more indicative of addiction vs less indicative of addiction. Using McDonald’s omega, the NAP was found to have high internal consistency, with an omega coefficient of 0.958. All subscales had an omega coefficient greater than 0.89.

Item Analysis.

Note. Mean inter-item-correlation = 0.480. NAP = Nicotine Addiction Perceptions.

A Pearson’s correlation between the NAP, harm perceptions, and addiction perceptions provided evidence of convergent validity (seeTable 3). A Pearson’s correlation between the NAP, FTND, and NDSS provided evidence of discriminant validity (seeTable 3). For criterion validity, the association between NAP, quit intentions and past quit attempts, and past month use was examined. For every unit increase in perceptions of nicotine addiction, intentions to quit using e-cigarettes in the next 6 months increased (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.04;P =.007;Table 4). Participants who perceived vaping behaviors as more addictive were more likely to report future intentions to quit vaping. For each unit of increased perception of nicotine addiction, the number of quit attempts over the past 12 months decreased by a factor of 0.99 (95% CI [0.98, 1.00]). Participants who perceived vaping behaviors as more addictive were likely to have attempted fewer quit attempts over the past 12 months. For every unit increase in perceptions of nicotine addiction, the number of days vaped in the past 30 days increased (b < 0.01,P= .039). Participants who perceived vaping behaviors as more addictive were likely to have vaped more over the past 30 days. Full regression results can be viewed inSupplemental Material 5.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to create and then validate a scale assessing perceptions of nicotine addiction that comprehensively aligns with the DSM-5 dimensions of tobacco use disorder. As each item within the NAP was created using this framework, item difficulty was largely endorsed (ie, respondents indicated similar responses for each item as being indicative of nicotine addiction), suggesting that perceptions of nicotine addiction generally align with the clinical diagnosis of nicotine dependence. Using item response theory, three items assessing the factor “Consistent Desire to Quit/Reduce Use” were not effective at differentiating between individuals who perceived vaping behaviors to be more indicative of addiction vs less indicative of addiction. However, according to clinical guidelines this is an important facet of nicotine addiction. Thus, this factor was retained when establishing criterion validity. Study results also suggest that perceptions of nicotine addiction can be reliably measured in a general adult sample of people who actively use an e-cigarette and those who do not use e-cigarettes with adequate internal validity. In this regard, the 23-item NAP scale assesses perceptions of nicotine addiction as a unique construct.

In establishing convergent validity, it was anticipated that the NAP scale would converge with single item assessments of health risk perceptions used widely in research.36Our study found that as NAP scores increase, so do perceptions of health harm. Higher NAP scores were related to increased perceptions of harm to one’s own health and other’s health. Additionally, perceptions that e-cigarettes are more harmful than combustible cigarettes were related to higher overall NAP scores. Interestingly, there was a small yet significant correlation between perceived likelihood of becoming addicted to e-cigarettes and NAP scores. This may be attributable to people’s underestimation of the addictiveness of e-cigarettes,50or that people do not have a clear understanding of what addiction is. Without this understanding, people may be unable to estimate the likelihood of becoming addicted to nicotine. The NAP may provide deeper insight into people’s mental schemas surrounding the development of nicotine addiction.

In establishing discriminant validity, we anticipated that the NAP scale would be discernable from existing nicotine dependence measures (ie, FTND, NDSS) as the former assesses perceptions related to behaviors, and the latter assesses addictive behavior. Our findings suggest that the NAP assesses a different construct than that of the FTND and NDSS (ie, perceptions of addiction vs assessments of addiction severity). Given that the FTND and NDSS are both considered measures of addiction severity, we expected a moderate to large correlation between these two measures. However, within this sample, these scores were not related. This lends support to the concept that it is difficult to compare scores between the FTND and NDSS as they do not ask comparable questions despite aims to assess the same construct. Moreover, this exemplifies issues found in research that having non standardized measures assessing one construct may challenge public health efforts due to uncertainty or lack of applicability to the general public.51,52

In establishing criterion validity, we anticipated that the NAP scale would relate to vaping-related behaviors and intentions. Our findings are supported by previous research where those with higher perceptions of addiction are more likely to report intentions of quitting in the near future.53However, NAP scores were significantly related to 6 month quit intentions, but not 30 day quit intentions. Research has found that smokers who are concerned about relapsing are less likely to attempt quitting,54and in this regard, the current study sample of e-cigarette users may be interested in quitting in the near future, but not yet prepared to make an actual attempt in the next month. Moreover, this may also provide insight into this sample’s lack of quit attempts over the past year (56% reported zero attempts). Additionally, it was anticipated that higher NAP scores would be associated with less past 30-day e-cigarette use. Within this sample, smokers with higher NAP scores were likely to report using e-cigarettes on more days out of the past month. In line with existing qualitative research, this sample may feel less control over their vaping and thus, use these products daily to satiate their craving/symptoms of addiction.55

Treating addiction can be difficult, in part due to people’s inability to acknowledge they are addicted, or their desire to not be labeled an addict due to the negative connotation surrounding this term.56Much of the work educating the public has prioritized theconsequencesof nicotine addiction rather than theexperiencesof nicotine addiction. This may help explain why lay people’s perceptions of nicotine addiction encompass only five of 11 clinical dimensions. Education efforts should emphasize the dimensions of addiction –rather than a simple definition – so that people can recognize that they, or a loved one, is addicted and seek help prior to experiencing particularly damaging consequences of addiction (eg, lung cancer, COPD, death, etc.).57

Most current preventative and intervention programs highlight the negative consequences of tobacco use, but the lack of emphasis surrounding other dimensions of addiction (eg, persistent desire to reduce/control use, recreational activities are given up/reduced due to substance use, etc.) may be diminishing the fact that active smokers are using tobacco against their will. This last part, using tobacco against one’s will, is a clinically recognized aspect of addiction and is demonstrated epidemiologically that over 70% of current smokers regret initiating in the first place.58Yet, this aspect of addiction is not well understood by the general public. Future research may choose to examine whether people’s knowledge in this area could be used to help prevent future tobacco use.

A limitation of the study is the time period in which data were collected (late December 2023). Nearing the end of the year, some individuals make resolutions for the upcoming new year, predominantly related to changing health behavior.59In this regard, respondents may have been more inclined to report having future intentions to quit vaping. However, among the current study sample, almost half of active e-cigarette users reported no intention of quitting vaping (49.27%). Data were collected at one time point and were therefore, cross-sectional. Future studies will be needed to assess how people’s perceptions of nicotine addiction changes across time. This may also be helpful in understanding whether and/or how perceptions change and ultimately, their impact on behavior change. Additionally, future research should employ more advanced statistical techniques (eg, structural equation modeling) with the aim of further examining the relationships between perceptions of nicotine addiction and smoking behaviors. Some latent factors may be more relevant to cessation outcomes than an overall scale score. Lastly, we recognize that a 23-item scale may contribute to participant response burden, and that some items are highly correlated with one another (seeSupplemental Material 4). In this regard, we plan on improving the NAP scale by creating short-form versions that remove highly correlated items but still encompass as many DSM-5 dimensions as possible and assess their reliability and validity among different samples.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to create a comprehensive scale assessing perceptions of nicotine addiction using the clinical dimensions of tobacco use disorder as a framework. Items in the final NAP scale returned acceptable diagnostics using IRT guidelines and construct validity was established using convergent, discriminant, and criterion validity. The findings from this study suggest that for most, perceptions of nicotine addiction may not align with DSM-5 clinical criteria, which may be due potentially to the lack of education surrounding addiction. Future research examining perceptions of nicotine addiction can utilize the NAP scale to better understand lay people’s understanding of addiction and its relationship to vaping related behaviors. Public health efforts can utilize the scale to adapt curriculum to focus on the experiences of nicotine addiction, rather than just the consequences of nicotine addiction to promote healthy behavior.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the most common diseases in cats and accounts for substantial mortality, especially in older animals [1]. Currently, routine diagnosis of CKD is mainly limited to the detection of advanced azotemic disease (increased serum creatinine and/or urea in combination with decreased urine concentrating ability) [2]. Because these biomarkers only begin to show abnormalities in an advanced disease stage, they are insensitive markers for early diagnosis of renal failure [3,4]. Recently, also symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) titration has emerged as a more sensitive marker for detection and monitoring of CKD, although it can be influenced by other factors than CKD and must hence be interpreted alongside other diagnostic markers. Importantly, early detection of CKD is crucial for improving the prognosis of the cat. Because timely therapeutic intervention can prevent or delay disease progression and complications, survival time increases as the animal is diagnosed in earlier stages of the disease (International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) Stages) [2,3,5].

The most sensitive and accurate measure to assess kidney function is the evaluation of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [4]. GFR measurement allows early detection of decreased kidney function (IRIS stage I and early stage II), before azotemia develops (advanced IRIS stage II or higher) [6]. However, the gold standard method to measure GFR (urine clearance of inulin) has important practical limitations and is not used in clinical practice [4]. Recently, iohexol has been suggested as an ideal exogenous filtration marker and has been shown to provide reliable GFR assessments in animals as well as in humans [7–9]. In cats, both iohexol and exogenous creatinine are used in plasma clearance tests and both filtration markers allow reliable estimations of GFR [10]. Still, there is an urgent need for more practical, cost-effective and accurate methods to detect early feline CKD [3].

For GFR evaluation based on plasma iohexol or exogenous creatinine clearance, repeated blood samplings at multiple time points are proposed [8]. However, the practical use of such multi-sampling techniques in cats is hampered because they are time-consuming, labor-intensive and may be painful or stressful for the patient [3]. To reduce the invasiveness associated with conventional blood sampling and to overcome practical hurdles linked to repeated sampling, human medicine has gained interest in microsampling techniques. Microsampling techniques only require a minimal amount of capillary blood (< 50 µL), collected via a finger stick or ear-prick (in cats). Moreover, microsampling devices allow for remote blood sampling and increased analyte stability, while reducing logistic costs for sample transportation [11,12]. Dried blood spots (DBS) are the best known and most frequently used dried blood microsamples and have been used successfully to measure iohexol-based GFR in human medicine [13–16]. To overcome DBS-related issues such as the well-known hematocrit (hct) effect, more specialized devices such as volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS) systems, allowing the collection of a fixed amount of blood, independent of the hct, have been developed [17,18]. VAMS devices consist of a plastic handler to which a hydrophilic polymeric tip is attached that will wick up an exact volume of e.g. 10 µL of blood, irrespective of the hematocrit. Recently, also methods for the determination of iohexol in VAMS samples have been developed for use in human medicine [19–21].

The application of microsampling has great potential in feline nephrology, not only by enhancing the practicality of GFR procedures, but also by allowing follow-up of the kidney function of cats diagnosed with CKD (via measurement of endogenous creatinine) while supporting animal welfare through its minimally invasive nature. In preclinical animal research, microsampling is a powerful tool that supports the3R(reduce, refine, replace) principle by enhancing ethical standards in animal research [22]. The collection of smaller sample volumes allows for multiple samples to be taken from the same animal, dramaticallyreducingthe number of required animals in animal experimentation studies. Moreover, byrefiningthe procedures, stress and pain for the animals is minimized, while data quality and research efficiency maximize. Consequently, more invasive animal studies can bereplacedor avoided [11,23].

In this study, we investigated the use of VAMS-assisted ear-prick sampling as a tool to measure iohexol and creatinine concentrations in cat samples. We developed and analytically validated LC-MS/MS methods for the simultaneous quantification of iohexol and creatinine in blood, plasma and VAMS samples. Particular emphasis was placed on the ethical and sustainable aspects of the method by employing human blood-based matrices for calibration and utilizing microsampling to minimize the reliance on cat blood. As such, the framework of this study may serve as a basis for implementation of the 3R principle in bio-analytical method validation. Subsequent clinical validation was performed by comparing results obtained in plasma, venous (liquid and dried) blood samples and dried capillary blood samples from cats to determine whether capillary ear-prick samples could be used as an alternative matrix to reliably measure iohexol and creatinine concentrations. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study (i) applying VAMS technology as such in cats, (ii) comparing all different blood-based matrices for iohexol and creatinine in a time-dependent manner and (iii) providing a successful application of VAMS technology in the context of quantification of iohexol and creatinine concentrations, a vital step to obtain reliable GFR estimations.

Iohexol and creatinine-d3 powder were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Diegem, Belgium). Creatinine reference material (SRM 914a) was used from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Creatinine-13C3d3 was purchased from Alsachim (Illkirch Graffenstaden, France), while iohexol-d5 was from TRC (Toronto, Canada). Creatinine-13C was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (CIL, Tewksbury, Massachusetts, USA). Formic acid (FA) and LC-MS grade methanol were purchased from Chem-Lab (Zedelgem, Belgium). LC-MS grade acetonitrile (ACN) was obtained from Biosolve (Valkenswaard, The Netherlands). Ultrapure water was produced by a Millipore purification system (Merck Millipore, Overijse, Belgium). LC-MS grade 2-propanol and desiccant packages (10 g Minipax absorbent packets) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. VAMS devices (10 µL; brand name Mitra™) were purchased from Trajan Scientific (Victoria, Australia).

For the internal standards (IS), 5 mg of creatinine-13C3d3 and 10 mg of iohexol-d5 were dissolved in ultrapure water and methanol to yield concentrations of 5 and 10 mg/mL, respectively. The IS solutions were stored at -20 °C. On the day of analysis, these were further diluted in 90/10 water/MeOH to generate a solution of 5 µg/mL for creatinine-13C3d3 and 5 µg/mL for iohexol-d5.

Stock solutions from creatinine-d3 and iohexol were prepared in water at a concentration of 20 mg/mL. All stock solutions were stored at -80 °C. For the calibrators, a mix of the stock solutions of both analytes was diluted with water to a concentration of 10 mg/mL. This stock solution was diluted to end up with 8 distinct working solutions, each leading to the generation of a single calibrator level. Blood and plasma were spiked with these working solutions, with the spiked volume not exceeding 5% of the total volume. Eight calibrators were prepared for both whole blood and plasma within the calibration range of 2 to 400 µg/mL for both iohexol and creatinine-d3.

In parallel, four QC working solutions were independently prepared from the working solutions for the calibrators to prepare QCs at 4 different levels in human blood and plasma: lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), low (QCL), mid (QCM) and high (QCH) level. Additionally, QCs were also prepared in cat blood and plasma at 2 different levels: QCL and QCH.

The spiked whole blood and plasma calibrators and QCs were briefly homogenized via inverting the 2 mL cups and placing them on a roller to incubate for 30 min at room temperature (RT). Next, calibrators and QCs were generated via dipping the tip of the VAMS device in the blood. These tips consist of a hydrophilic polymer that will wick up an exact volume (here 10 µL) of blood, irrespective of the hematocrit. Once the tip was completely filled, it was held in the blood for an additional 2 s to ensure complete filling and the resulting VAMS samples were dried for at least 2 h under ambient conditions prior to extraction. If samples were not immediately analyzed, they were stored in zip-lock bags containing desiccant and stored at -80 °C until analysis. Also for the analysis of whole blood and plasma, the abovementioned calibrators and QCs were used.

The use of blood from healthy, adult, human volunteers was approved by the Ghent University Hospital Ethics Committee (EC-BC 07324) and included a statement of informed consent. Blank venous whole blood, collected in EDTA tubes (BD Vacutainer, New Jersey, USA) and plasma derived thereof was collected from a healthy, female, human volunteer to generate calibrators and QCs. Similarly, cat blood and plasma were collected for the generation of QCs. The use of cat blood was approved by the owners of the animals and included a statement of informed consent. For the evaluation of matrix effects (ME) and recovery (RE), blank EDTA whole blood and plasma derived thereof was collected from 6 healthy, human volunteers. For the generation of VAMS samples with a broad hct range, the blood was centrifuged for 5 min at 4000 g and a specific amount of plasma was added or removed. The plasma was generated by centrifuging an aliquot of whole blood in an Eppendorf 5804R Centrifuge (Hamburg, Germany) for 5 min at 4000 g. A Sysmex XN-1000 hematology analyzer (Sysmex Corp., Kobe, Japan) was used to determine the hct value of the whole blood, whenever necessary.

From the blood and plasma samples, 50 µL was extracted by adding 950 µL extraction solvent containing IS (90/10 water/MeOH). The 2 mL cups were vortexed, followed by 3 min shaking on a Thermoshaker (Biosan, Riga, Latvia) at 1400 rpm and at 24 °C. Next, after vortex mixing, 100 µL was transferred to a 1 mL 96-well (round-well, round bottom) plate (Agilent, Diegem, Belgium) to which 300 µL cold MeOH (stored at 4 °C) was added for protein precipitation. After shaking on a Thermoshaker for 3 min at 1400 rpm and at 25 °C, and subsequent centrifugation for 10 min at 2250 g and at 4 °C, 20 µL of the supernatant was diluted with 100 µL of mobile phase (MP) A (0.1% FA in water) in a 350 µL 96-well sample collection plate (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). This final plate was then centrifuged prior to injection onto the UPLC®system.

For the analysis of the VAMS samples, the tip of the device was detached manually from the handle into a 1 mL 96-well (round-well, round bottom) plate. For the following steps, an automated extraction protocol was developed using the Waters Andrew + pipetting robot. After dispensing 200 µL of extraction solvent with IS (90/10 water/MeOH), the plate was shaken 2 times for 10 min at 1400 rpm and at 24 °C. After addition of 600 µL of 75/25 ACN/MeOH for protein precipitation, the plate was removed manually from the robot and centrifuged 2 times for 5 min at 2250 g and at 4 °C, while using an exact counterweight in order to ensure full precipitation of all proteins (as outlined below). In the meantime, 100 µL of MP A was added to a 350 µL 96-well sample collection plate by the robot. After putting the precipitation plate back in the robot manually, 20 µL of supernatant was transferred to the final collection plate, already containing MP A. This final plate was then centrifuged prior to injection onto the UPLC®system.

All samples were analyzed using a Waters Acquity UPLC®coupled to a Waters XEVO TQ-S mass spectrometer. The hardware was controlled by Masslynx software (version 4.2). Creatinine and iohexol were chromatographically separated on an Acquity UPLC®HSS T3 column (100 × 2.1 mm; 1.8 μm; Waters) with corresponding VanGuard precolumn held at 30 °C. The autosampler was maintained at 10 °C. A 3 min gradient elution program was used with MP A consisting of 0.1% FA in water and MP B consisting of 0.1% FA in MeOH. The flow rate was always set at 0.4 mL/min. The gradient starts at 100% MP A and is steeply increased to 60% MP B after 0.5 min, followed by another steep increase to 100% MP B after 1.1 min, followed by a short isocratic period of 100% MP B for 0.4 min and finally reversal to starting conditions, maintained for 1.5 min, resulting in a total run time of 3 min. The MS was equipped with an electrospray (ESI) source operating in positive ionization mode. An optimized multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method was used to detect the compounds. The optimized MS parameters were the following: capillary voltage 4.0 kV; desolvation gas (N2) temperature 250 °C at a gas flow of 600 L/h; cone gas (N2) flow rate 150 L/h with a source temperature of 150 °C; nebulizer gas pressure (N2) 7 bar. As collision gas, argon was used at a flow rate of 0.15 mL/min. For all analytes, two characteristic precursor-to-product ion transitions were monitored, while for the corresponding IS one transition was analyzed. MRM transitions, as well as the compound-specific MS parameters, are listed in Supplementary Table1.

Because of the endogenous presence of creatinine in all native whole blood and plasma samples, creatinine in calibrators and QC samples was substituted by creatinine-d3 as a “surrogate” analyte. In this way, standard addition could be avoided to quantify creatinine. However, we observed a difference in ionization efficiency for creatinine compared to creatinine-d3, resulting in a different abundance of the correspondingm/zfragments. Therefore, to ensure a correct quantification of creatinine using this approach, 29 plasma samples were analyzed using creatinine-d3 calibration as well as using a creatinine reference measurement procedure. The method is contained in list I (Reference Measurement Procedures; NRMeth 1) of the Joint Committee for Traceability in Laboratory Medicine (JCTLM) database (seewww.bipm.org). Six plasma samples were derived from healthy, human donors and twenty-three plasma samples from cats (both with normal and impaired kidney function). In order to cover the entire calibration range, ten samples were spiked with an additional amount of creatinine (40, 100, 200 or 300 µg/mL).

Based on the agreement between the results of both methods for all 29 creatinine samples, the need for a conversion factor, caused by the use of creatinine-d3 calibration, was evaluated. Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed to evaluate the presence of systematic and proportional differences.

The methods were validated based on the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines on bio-analytical method validation, as well as the IATDMCT guideline for the validation of dried blood spot-based methods [24–26].

The calibration model for the analytes in each matrix was statistically evaluated using an R-script developed by Desharnais et al. [27]. In short, using this script, heteroscedasticity was evaluated via an F-test. Next, a variance test for weight selection was done to select the most appropriate weighting factor. Additionally, a partial F-test was run to determine the model order. Finally, a Cramer von Mises test was performed to verify a normal distribution of the standardized residuals. The % bias of the back-calculations of the calibrators with the selected model should be less than 15% (20% at LLOQ level) for 75% of all calibrators.

Accuracy and precision were evaluated in human blood, plasma and VAMS samples based on the analysis of four different QC levels (LLOQ, QCL, QCM and QCH) over 3 different days, analyzed in duplicate on each day for all matrices. In parallel, accuracy and precision were evaluated in cat blood, plasma and VAMS samples by the analysis of two different QC levels (QCL cat and QCH cat), prepared in blood and plasma from 4 cats, over 3 different days, analyzed in duplicate on each day for all matrices. The acceptance limit for accuracy (% bias) was set at 15% (20% at LLOQ level). Repeatability and total precision were calculated via one-way ANOVA. The % coefficient of variation (CV) limit for the repeatability and total precision was set at 15% (20% at LLOQ level).

Two blank samples (without analyte or IS in the extraction solvent) were injected after the highest calibrator to evaluate carry-over. The response at the retention time of the analyte or IS in the blank samples was considered acceptable if the signal was less than 20% of the analyte peak area at LLOQ and less than 5% of the peak area of the IS.

To assess selectivity, the pre-dosing samples (cat samples) from the clinical validation study were used (as outlined below). For iohexol, the selectivity of the method was confirmed when the signal was less than 20% of the LLOQ area and less than 5% of the IS area. For creatinine, ion ratios were compared between neat standard solutions on the one hand and the native blood, plasma and VAMS study samples on the other hand. The absence of interferences was accepted when the ion ratio of the native samples was within ± 20% of the ratio in the neat standard solutions [28].

ME and RE were evaluated following the approach described by Matuszewski et al. [29]. For this, blank samples from 6 individual human donors were used at two different concentration levels (QCL and QCH). For the VAMS samples, also samples prepared from blood with low and high hct were included (hct of 0.168 and 0.543 L/L). A first set of samples was spiked before extraction (A), a second set after extraction (B), and a third set in the absence of the matrix to be assessed (C). The absolute ME was calculated for each donor by dividing the analyte peak area in the presence of matrix spiked after extraction (B) by the peak area in the absence of that same matrix (C). The relative IS corrected ME (CV) should be below 15%. For the evaluation of the RE, the signals obtained in samples spiked before (A) and after (B) extraction were compared. For RE, the relative RE (CV) should be below 15%.

For the VAMS samples, in addition to evaluation of the RE at normal hct (0.35 L/L), a possible impact of the hct on the RE was also evaluated at five different hct levels (target values at 0.17, 0.25, 0.35, 0.45 and 0.55 L/L). Human blood at all hct levels was spiked with the analytes at Low and High QC level before and after extraction of the VAMS samples (n= 6 for each condition). The RE was calculated by dividing the peak areas at each condition in the set spiked before extraction by those of the corresponding samples spiked after extraction. The RE for the lower and higher hct blood were compared to the RE at hct 0.35 L/L (considered the reference hct). The relative IS-compensated RE for the lower and higher hct levels should be within ± 15% of the RE for VAMS samples prepared from blood with a hct of 0.35 L/L to be considered hct-independent.

Because the stability of iohexol and creatinine has already been investigated in blood, plasma and dried blood samples [8,21,30], stability was only investigated at the storage conditions applied to the actual study samples. For blood and plasma, stability was evaluated after storage for 1 week at 4 °C for QCL, QCH and two native cat samples (‘cat sample 1’ and ‘cat sample 2’, containing iohexol and creatinine) (n= 3). For the VAMS samples, stability was evaluated after storage for 1 week at RT and for 2 days at 60 °C for QCL, QCH and two native cat samples (‘cat sample 1’ and ‘cat sample 2’, containing iohexol and creatinine) (n= 3). For storage, the VAMS samples were put into zip-lock bags containing desiccant. For all evaluations, stability studies were performed isochronally. All samples were analyzed together within one run, and the analytes were considered stable under the specific storage conditions when the deviation was less than 15% compared to the concentration determined from the reference samples (t0samples which were stored at -80 °C during the entire duration of the stability studies).

For the evaluation of long term stability at -80 °C, cat blood and plasma samples collected during the GFR protocol from 2 cats were pooled to obtain a ‘pool’ with a relatively low and relatively high concentration of both analytes. Blood, plasma and VAMS samples (generated from the whole blood ‘pools’) were stored at -80 °C and analyzed in triplicate on each study sample analysis day. In this way, the stability could be assessed longitudinally and the analytes were considered stable in the different matrices if the deviation was within 15% of the concentration determined at the first study sample analysis day (t0).

Stability of the extracts for all matrices was also evaluated at low and high QC level, in addition to four cat samples (QCL and QCH samples from 2 cats). Sample extracts (n= 2) were reinjected after 24 and 48 h in the autosampler, held at 10 °C, and after 2 weeks at -20 °C (one freeze thaw cycle), together with the calibration curve that had been stored under the same conditions. The % deviation from time 0 (t0) was evaluated and should be less than 15%.

After the bioanalytical method validation, a clinical validation study was performed for iohexol and creatinine. Client-owned cats and cats with (early and advanced) CKD were selected from an ongoing prospective study approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Faculty of Bioscience Engineering (Ghent University) (EC 2021/075). Approval by the owner was confirmed with a signed informed consent. Further details on the included cats can be found in Supplementary Table2.

Venous EDTA-anticoagulated blood (max. 1 mL per collection time point) (collected in 4.0 mL BD Vacutainer tubes; BD Benelux, Erembodegem, Belgium) and duplicate 10 µL capillary VAMS (cVAMS) samples obtained after an ear-prick were collected from 23 cats before and after they received a single intravenous bolus injection of iohexol (Omnipaque, 64.7 mg/kg body weight) and creatinine (40 mg/kg body weight). No sedation was performed prior to sample collection. A photograph of the collection of the cVAMS sample is included in Fig.1. During the GFR protocol, samples were collected before administration (t0, pre-dosing samples) and 5, 30, 60, 120, 180, 360 and 600 min after administration of iohexol and creatinine. Additionally, plasma was derived from the venous blood, and duplicate venous VAMS (vVAMS) samples were prepared from the venous blood within 1 h after collection. For the collection of the cVAMS samples, the ear was cleaned with an alcohol wipe, dried, and punctured using a contact-activated safety lancet (BD Microtainer, BD Benelux) by a trained veterinarian. The first capillary drop of blood was discarded. After collection, all liquid samples were stored at 4 °C, while VAMS samples were stored at ambient temperature in zip-lock bags containing desiccant, before transport to the Laboratory of Toxicology within 1 week (covered by stability data). There, whole blood and plasma were aliquoted per 50 µL for analysis. VAMS samples were dried for a minimum of 2 h. All samples were stored at -80 °C until analysis.

Iohexol and creatinine were determined in all samples (plasma, whole blood, vVAMS and cVAMS) using the developed and validated LC-MS/MS methods (as described in 2.1). The hct of the EDTA whole blood samples collected at t0was determined using a Pro-Analytical C1015 centrifuge (Centurion Scientific, Chichester, United Kingdom).

Results obtained for the quantification of iohexol and creatinine were compared to assess the (extent of) agreement between the different matrices via the generation of Bland-Altman plots and Passing-Bablok regression analysis using Medcalc software, version 20.021 (Ostend, Belgium). Four comparisons were made: (1) bloodversusplasma; (2) vVAMS samplesversusblood; (3) cVAMSversusvVAMS samples; and (4) cVAMS samplesversusplasma. For creatinine, time-dependent differences between blood and plasma concentrations were evaluated via the generation of boxplots per sampling timepoint using Graphpad Prism 9 (version 9.0.2; Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). For comparison (2) and (4), an acceptance criterion of < 20% difference for 2/3 of the samples was taken, as recommended by Capiau et al. in the guideline for the development and validation of dried blood-based methods and by the EMA for incurred sample reanalysis [25,26]. For the other direct comparisons, no acceptance criteria could be applied, as there may be an intrinsic difference between blood and plasma concentrations on the one hand, and between venous and capillary concentrations on the other hand.

As iohexol and creatinine reference concentrations are typically plasma-based, this implies that for clinical interpretation the results obtained from VAMS samples (dried blood) should ideally be convertible in a reliable manner to plasma concentrations. In this clinical validation study, we therefore assessed the correlation between concentrations in VAMS samples (blood) and corresponding plasma samples, using authentic patient samples and evaluated the need for a conversion factor. Different approaches can be used for conversion of a dried blood result to a plasma result, including hct-based conversion or conversion based on experimentally derived factors such as the Passing-Bablok regression fit, mean concentration ratio-based conversion and blood to plasma ratio-based conversion (Boffel et al. manuscript submitted). Since it is known that iohexol is only present in the plasma fraction of blood, we investigated the applicability of hct-based conversion using the hct determined at t0for each individual cat. For creatinine, the applicability of conversion based on the Blood/Plasma (B/P) ratios derived from the clinical validation study was evaluated in a time-dependent manner. The derived conversion formulas were applied to an independent dataset to confirm their validity (see 2.3).

Finally, the developed methodologies were applied to samples derived from 40 cats who were recruited in the application study. The same inclusion criteria were applied as in the clinical validation study. From these 40 cats, only plasma and cVAMS samples were collected and analyzed according to the procedure described in 2.2.2. To validate the performance of the conversion formulas derived from the results of the clinical validation study (see 3.2.3), these formulas were applied to the independent cVAMS application data. For iohexol, the following conversion formula was used:, with hct representing the hct from the individual cat obtained from the whole blood sample collected at t0. For creatinine, the final conversion formula was the following:, withrepresenting the mean Blood/Plasma ratio determined in the clinical validation study for each time point of sample collection (t0, t5, t30, t60, t120, t180, t360and t600). The mean B/P ratios for each time point can be found in Supplementary Table3.

The plasma concentrations derived from cVAMS samples were compared to the corresponding plasma concentrations via the generation of Bland-Altman plots and Passing-Bablok analysis using Medcalc software, version 20.021. Also here, an acceptance criterion of < 20% difference for 2/3 of the samples was taken [25,26].

For the sample preparation for VAMS samples, the same precipitation solvent as for blood and plasma (MeOH) was tested initially. However, this did not yield a full precipitation of all proteins in all samples. More specifically -and surprisingly- human blood samples behaved differently compared to the samples prepared from cat blood. Therefore, different precipitation solvent compositions were evaluated, with 75/25 ACN/MeOH yielding a reproducible protein precipitation in both human and cat blood samples. Additionally, for an optimized precipitation, the counterweight used in the centrifuge had to be exactly identical.

To evaluate the robustness of the extraction of analytes from the VAMS samples, the automated extraction procedure was tested for a relevant effect of storage (‘ageing’) and the hct on the RE, as these factors may pose a challenge related to extractability [31]. Both the volume of the extraction solvent and the extraction time were evaluated. The final sample preparation procedure for VAMS samples is described in the Methods Sect. (2.1.4). To assess the effect of the hct, the RE was evaluated at two concentration levels, QCL and QCH, for five hct values across a broad range (from 0.17 to 0.55 L/L), with each condition being measured in sixfold. Figure2shows the data for the IS-compensated RE, relative to the RE of a reference hct of 0.35 L/L (set at 100%). No hct dependence was apparent and the RE was within the pre-set acceptance criterion at all hct levels, for both analytes.

The RE was determined from VAMS samples (n= 6) with hct values ranging from 0.17 to 0.55 L/L, and normalised to the RE at reference hct (0.35 L/L). The upper and lower limits of acceptance of ± 15% are represented by the dashed lines (LLoA; ULoA). The left and right part of the graph show the results (mean ± CV%) for the Low and High QC level, respectively. VAMSvolumetric absorptive microsampling, CVcoefficient of variation, QCquality control

The need for a correction factor to compensate for the use of creatinine-d3 calibrators was evaluated by the analysis of 29 plasma samples using creatinine-d3 calibration as well as using the reference measurement procedure for quantification of creatinine. The presence of systematic and proportional differences was evaluated via Passing-Bablok regression analysis (Supplementary Fig.1). Both systematic and proportional differences were confirmed, as the 95% CI on the intercept and slope did not include 0 and 1, respectively (95% CI on intercept and slope, -0.91 to -0.32 and 0.75 to 0.80). Therefore, the obtained results were recalibrated to the reference measurement procedure targets in order to obtain a correct result using creatinine-d3 calibrators. The correction formula applied to correct the creatinine results is the equation of the Passing-Bablok regression analysis: y = -0.597 + 0.776 x. This correction formula was also applied to all the creatinine results in the clinical validation and application study.

All calibration models were linear with 1/x2weighting. Back-calculation of the calibrators fulfilled the acceptance criterion, justifying the use of the chosen model. In Table1, the accuracy and precision data for VAMS samples are shown for each QC level, including also QCL and QCH prepared in cat blood (indicated in bold). The bias was within 6% of the nominal concentration and both analytes could be determined with a repeatability and total imprecision below 9.6% (CV), meeting the pre-set acceptance criteria of 15% (20% at LLOQ). For blood and plasma, the accuracy and precision data are shown in Supplementary Table4. Also here, all pre-set acceptance criteria were met, apart from an overall limited exceedance of the acceptance criterion for the total imprecision for creatinine-d3 at LLOQ in plasma and at QCL in blood (24.4% and 21.0% CV, respectively) and for iohexol at QCL in blood (19.2% CV).

Carry-over was within the pre-set limits of < 20% of the LLOQ area and < 5% of the IS area. For selectivity, the pre-dosing samples from the clinical validation study were assessed, with no unacceptable interferences observed. The selectivity for iohexol was within the pre-set limits of < 20% of the LLOQ area and < 5% of the IS area. For creatinine, the ion ratios in all matrices were within the tolerated window (± 20%) of the ion ratio in neat standard solution (ratio 25%).

The results of the ME and RE obtained in the different matrices are displayed in Supplementary Table5. For iohexol, no noteworthy effect of the matrix on the ionization efficiency was observed, with absolute ME between 83% and 110%. However, for creatinine-d3 a substantial suppression of ionization (> 70% suppression in plasma) was observed. However, the IS-corrected ME all lay between 81% and 107%, indicating a good compensation of the IS for differences in ionization. Importantly, as creatinine(-d3) eluted early, incorporating a divert-to-waste step was essential to mitigate ME. The relative ME (CV) was below 6% in all cases, meeting the pre-set acceptance criterion of 15%. For the VAMS samples, including those at low and high hct, the relative ME lay below 5%, amply meeting the pre-set acceptance criterion. The absolute RE was relatively high in all cases (78 − 115%) and was reproducible, demonstrated by relative RE (CV) values below 8% and in this way also meeting the pre-set acceptance criterion of 15%.

The stability was investigated at the storage conditions relevant for the actual study samples, as displayed in Supplementary Table6for blood and plasma and in Supplementary Table7for VAMS samples. All analytes were stable in blood and plasma after storage for 1 week at 4 °C. Also, all analytes showed to be stable in VAMS devices stored for 1 week at RT. For iohexol and creatinine-d3 in VAMS devices, stability of the analytes for up to 2 days at 60 °C was demonstrated. As expected, a positive bias was found for creatinine after storage at elevated temperature, owing to conversion of creatine to creatinine following ring closure and the loss of a molecule of water of creatine to yield creatinine, as also found earlier [32,33]. Remarkably, this positive bias was not observed for creatinine in the cat samples stored at elevated temperature.

The long-term stability at -80 °C was assessed longitudinally during the study sample analysis days. For plasma, stability was demonstrated for 8 months (time between t0and t5), in blood for 3 months (time between t0and t2) and in VAMS samples for 6 months (time between t0and t3), as the % deviation from t0was within 15% (except for a slight exceedance in VAMS at t3at low level) (Supplementary Table8).

The stability was also assessed for processed extracts, kept for 24–48 h in the autosampler at 10 °C. All samples were within 15% of the concentration found at t0(except for creatinine at QCH in plasma (126% (24 h) and 128% (48 h)), overall justifying the reinjection of an analysis batch up to 48 h after the original analysis, when stored in the autosampler at 10 °C. No consistent or substantial degradation compared to t0was found when freezing extracts at -20 °C for 14 days after the first analysis, subsequent thawing and reanalysis (except for 3 deviating values for creatinine: Cat QC3 in plasma, QCL in blood and QCH in a VAMS sample). A summary of the extract stability data can be found in Supplementary Table9.

Twenty-three cats were included in the clinical validation study. Their characteristics are described in Supplementary Table10.

An overview of the results for both analytes per comparison can be found in Table2.

For iohexol, a large mean bias of -55.1% (95% CI -57.3 to -53.0) was found when comparing the results for cVAMS and plasma samples (Fig.3, Panel A). The limits of agreement (LoAs) lay at -79.0% and − 31.3% (Table2). The differences between both matrices can be related to the different comparisons made in Fig.3, Panels B-G.

When comparing blood and plasma results, a mean bias of -37.1% was found (95% CI -38.6 to -35.6) (Fig.3, Panel B). The LoAs lay at -53.7% and − 20.5% (Table2). Because it is known that iohexol shows negligible erythrocyte partitioning, it is typically quantified in plasma and hence the presence of erythrocytes in blood yields a dilution effect. This dilution effect can be estimated by the blood hct. Therefore, we corrected the iohexol blood results for the hct by using the following correction formula:, using the hct of the blood sample drawn at t0for each individual cat. When comparing these corrected blood concentrations to the corresponding plasma concentrations, a mean bias of 6.3% remained (95% CI 5.1 to 7.6) (Fig.3, Panel C). The LoAs lay at -7.5% and 20.2% (Table2).

When comparing the concentrations from vVAMS and blood samples (Fig.3, Panel D), a mean bias of -12.8% was observed (95% CI -14.1 to -11.4) and the LoAs lay at -28.3% and 2.8% (Table2). Whereas the acceptance criterion of < 20% mean difference for two-thirds of the samples, as recommended by Capiau et al. [26], was formally fulfilled for iohexol (with 111/135 (82%) of the differences being < 20%), Passing-Bablok regression showed significant proportional differences (95% CI on slope 0.86 to 0.89), whereas no systematic differences were apparent (95% CI on intercept − 0.36 to 0.49) (Fig.3, Panel E).

Upon comparing the concentrations of vVAMS and cVAMS samples(Fig.3,Panel F), a mean difference of -7.2% was observed (95% CI -9.5 to -5.0), with LoAs laying at -33.1% and 18.6%(Table2). Passing-Bablok regression analysis revealed a slight, but significant proportional error (95% CI on slope 0.90 to 0.94), while no systematic differences could be observed (95% CI on intercept − 0.28 to 0.84)(Fig.3,Panel G).

Overall, the differences observed in these different comparisons indicated the need to apply conversion formulas to reliably derive plasma concentrations from (dried) whole blood (whether venous or capillary) concentrations.

Comparison of the creatinine results obtained for cVAMS and plasma samples revealed a mean bias of -21.2% (95% CI -23.2 to -19.2) (Fig.4, Panel A). A significant, negative slope of -0.23 (95% CI -0.28 to -0.19) was found. The LoAs lay at -48.0% and 5.5% (Table2). The differences between the results of cVAMS and plasma samples can be related to the different comparisons displayed in Fig.4, Panels B-G.

When comparing blood and plasma results, a mean bias of -9.3% (95% CI -10.7 to -8.0) and a significant, negative slope of -0.17 (95% CI -0.19 to -0.14) were found (Fig.4, Panel B). The LoAs lay at -27.2% and 8.5% (Table2). The median B/P ratios per sampling time point are displayed in Fig.4, Panel C. The median B/P ratios at t5, t30, t180and t360were significantly different from the ratio at t0(before administration of creatinine), indicating a time-dependent change in B/P ratio after exogenous administration of creatinine.

Upon comparing the results obtained for vVAMS samples and blood, a mean bias of -7.2% (95% CI -8.4 to -6.0) was found (Fig.4, Panel D), with LoAs laying at -23.3% and 8.9% (Table2). With 168/181 (93%) of the differences being < 20%, the acceptance criterion of < 20% mean difference for two-thirds of the samples, was fulfilled for creatinine. However, Passing-Bablok regression showed slight, but significant proportional differences (95% CI on slope 0.90 to 0.94), whereas no systematic differences were apparent (95% CI on intercept − 0.48 to 0.50) (Fig.4, Panel E).

Comparison of cVAMS and vVAMS sample results showed a mean bias of -4.9% (95% CI -6.7 to -3.1) (Fig.4, Panel F). The LoA lay at -28.6% and 18.8% (Table2). A slight, but significant slope of -0.07 (95%CI -0.13 to -0.01) was apparent. Passing-Bablok regression analysis resulted in slight, but significant proportional and systematic differences (95% CI on slope 0.89 to 0.94, 95% CI on intercept 0.16 to 1.54) (Fig.4, Panel G).

Overall, also for creatinine the differences observed in these different comparisons indicated the need to apply conversion formulas to reliably derive plasma concentrations from (dried) whole blood (whether venous or capillary) concentrations.

To allow clinical interpretation of the cVAMS results for iohexol and creatinine, these should be converted to a plasma concentration, as reference concentrations are typically determined in plasma. Based on the results of the clinical validation study, we established conversion formulas to convert the results of cVAMS samples to ‘calculated plasma concentrations’.

For iohexol, we evaluated hct-based conversion using the hct determined at t0for each individual cat. Additionally, because we found a significant proportional difference between vVAMS samples and blood results (Fig.3, Panel E), we incorporated the slope of 0.88 as a constant factor in the conversion formula to compensate for this. The final conversion formula was the following:, with the hct corresponding to the whole blood hct from the individual cat at t0. The validity of this conversion formula was to be confirmed by applying it to the independent application dataset (see 2.3).

Based on Bland-Altman analysis for creatinine, 9.3% lower blood results compared to plasma were obtained (Fig.4, Panel B). The lower result in blood can be explained by a dilution factor in blood, compared to plasma. In order to obtain plasma concentrations from cVAMS concentrations, we evaluated a conversion based on the B/P ratio. While doing so, we noticed a time-dependent change in B/P ratio after administration (Fig.4, Panel C). Therefore, the B/P ratios were determined for each individual sampling time point based on the clinical validation data. The mean B/P ratios and CV (%) are reported in Supplementary Table3. Because we also found a significant proportional bias between the creatinine results obtained for vVAMS samples and blood (Fig.4, panel E), the slope of 0.92 was incorporated as a constant factor in the conversion formula to take this into account. As for creatinine, the difference between the cVAMS and plasma results was not dependent on the hct, no hct-dependent conversion was required. The final conversion formula derived from the clinical validation data that was to be validated via the independent application dataset (see 2.3) was the following:, withrepresenting the mean B/P ratio for each time point of sample collection (t0, t5, t30, t60, t120, t180, t360and t600).

Forty cats were included in the application study. Their characteristics are described in Supplementary Table10.

To validate the conversion formulas for iohexol and creatinine described in 3.2.3, these were applied on cVAMS samples collected from 40 different cats, recruited in the framework of a study aiming at evaluating the applicability of ear-prick sampling for GFR determination. These converted cVAMS results (expressed as ‘calculated plasma concentrations’) were compared to those obtained for the corresponding venous plasma samples, in which the concentration had been directly measured.

For iohexol, the comparison of calculated plasma concentrations and the corresponding measured plasma concentrations revealed a minimal and non-significant mean bias of 1.1% (95% CI -0.2 to 2.4), with no concentration-dependent effects (Fig.5, Panel A). The LoAs lay at -19.0% and 21.2% (Table3). The acceptance criterion of < 20% mean difference for two-thirds of the samples was easily met with 220/233 (94%) of the differences being < 20%. Passing-Bablok regression analysis revealed neither systematic nor proportional differences (95% CI on intercept − 1.36 to 0.42, 95% CI on slope 0.97 to 1.05) (Fig.5, Panel B).

For creatinine, Bland-Altman comparison between calculated plasma concentrations and the corresponding measured plasma concentrations revealed a small yet significant mean bias of -3.5% (95% CI -4.5 to -2.5), with a slight concentration dependence, as indicated by a small but significant slope of the trend line between the differences, of -0.04 (95% CI -0.06 to -0.02) (Fig.5, Panel C). The LoAs lay at -21.3% and 14.3% (Table3). For creatinine, 307/320 (96%) of the differences were < 20%, amply meeting the acceptance criterion as recommended by Capiau et al. Both (slight) systematic and proportional differences were obtained via Passing-Bablok regression analysis (95% CI on intercept 0.35 to 1.67, 95% CI on slope 0.92 to 0.96) (Fig.5, Panel D).

In this study, we developed, optimized and analytically validated novel LC-MS/MS methods for the simultaneous quantification of iohexol and creatinine in blood, plasma and VAMS samples. Additionally, the goal was to assess whether VAMS-based ear-prick sampling could potentially be used for future GFR determination based on both iohexol and creatinine clearance, following conversion of cVAMS results to plasma results. This is relevant to further minimize the invasiveness and potentially also stress for the cats and to increase the practical feasibility of the otherwise cumbersome GFR sampling procedure.

First, LC-MS/MS assays for the different matrices (venous plasma and blood, vVAMS and cVAMS samples) were successfully developed, optimized and analytically validated. Special attention was paid to the sustainability of the procedure by minimizing the use of cat blood – both for the validation and the eventual application.

The amount of cat samples in the analytical validation was kept as low as possible by preparing calibrators for the quantification of the study samples in human-based matrices instead of in cat-based matrices. This is highly relevant, as larger quantities of human blood are much more easy to obtain than larger quantities of cat blood. However, this involved a thorough evaluation and optimization. E.g., we encountered an unanticipated difference in protein precipitation in human blood compared to cat blood, which required optimization of the precipitation solvent (decreasing the polarity by increasing the % acetonitrile compared to the % methanol). One possible explanation is that, while the general types of proteins in human and cat blood are similar, the concentrations and specific forms of these proteins may differ due to species-specific physiology [34]. To confirm and validate the matrix compatibility, accuracy and precision of the methods were also assessed in cat blood samples. An excellent accuracy was obtained for VAMS samples prepared from cat blood, with a maximum bias of 2.8%. The method also proved to be precise in cat blood VAMS samples, with intra-day precision and total imprecision below 5.5% and 8%, respectively. The pre-set acceptance criteria for accuracy and precision were easily met, in this way also indirectly demonstrating acceptable ME and RE in samples prepared from cat blood. As such, the validity of calibration in human blood (which is more readily available) for quantification of cat blood samples was confirmed.

A second aspect of the sustainable nature of the procedure lies in the use of VAMS samples, only requiring 10 µL of cat blood via a minimally invasive ear-prick. An important disadvantage of a dried blood matrix is the requirement of a more elaborate sample preparation procedure. To overcome this hurdle, we developed an automated extraction procedure using the Waters Andrew + pipetting robot. Importantly, as we were aware of a potential effect of the hct on the RE of the analytes, especially when using an automated extraction procedure [35], we evaluated the robustness of the method for this hct effect more into depth. The hct independence was demonstrated by relative RE values within the pre-set acceptance criterion across a broad hct range from 0.17 to 0.55 L/L (covering the hct range of the study population). Similarly, using a manual extraction procedure, Dhondt et al. showed that iohexol can be quantified reliably in VAMS samples with hct values between 0.20 and 0.60 L/L [21]. The robust, automated extraction procedure reported here allows high-throughput analysis of VAMS samples.

Following analytical method validation, the method was clinically validated to evaluate the interchangeability of the ‘calculated plasma concentrations’, derived from the VAMS-based ear-prick sampling, and the concentrations in (venous) plasma, i.e. the conventional sample used for GFR measurements. This clinical validation encompassed the comparison and statistical evaluation of paired VAMS, venous blood and plasma samples [26]. For the comparison of the concentrations of cVAMS and plasma samples, for both iohexol and creatinine a large negative bias of -55.1% and − 21.2% was found, respectively. However, when comparing these two matrices, multiple variables are evaluated and should be taken into account: (1) intrinsic differences between blood and plasma concentrations, (2) the effect of the use of VAMS as a sampling technique and (3) the effect of capillaryversusvenous sampling. As a result, the differences observed between cVAMS and plasma results reflect a combination of all these factors and can be further analyzed through the remaining comparisons made in the clinical validation study.

First, for iohexol, when comparing blood and plasma concentrations, a large negative bias of -37.1% was found. This was expected and in alignment with previous reports describing that iohexol shows negligible erythrocyte partitioning and is hence mainly present in the plasma fraction of blood [36,37]. When comparing blood to plasma results, the presence of erythrocytes yields a dilution effect which can be approximated by the blood hct. The mean hct of the study population was 35.5% and explains the 37.1% higher concentrations found in plasma compared to blood. When correcting the blood result according to the cat’s individual hct (determined at t0) the bias becomes 6.3% (95% CI 5.1 to 7.6). This slight ‘overcorrection’ might be explained by an overestimation of the hct at an individual level for the later time points, when using only the hct determined at t0for correction of all samples (at all time points) for an individual cat. Because a substantial total amount of blood is drawn from the cat during the procedure (one of the reasons to evaluate a microsampling-assisted procedure), this might have a slight influence on the hct at the end of the procedure.

For creatinine, the blood results were on average 9.3% lower than those in plasma. At baseline (t0), blood concentrations were 7.6% lower than in plasma. This observation is in line with literature [32,33], with the lower blood results being attributable to a dilution factor in blood, compared to plasma, although less pronounced than for iohexol. Additionally and importantly, a significant concentration-dependent trend was observed, indicating that the bias increases with the concentration. When plotting the B/P ratio for creatinine at each time point of sample collection, a significant decrease compared to the ratio at t0(only endogenous creatinine) can be observed after administration of exogenous creatinine. This ratio gradually normalized again, until reaching an equilibrium at the ratio initially observed for endogenous creatinine. This concentration-dependent trend (negative bias in samples with higher creatinine concentration, collected at early sampling time points) indicates that it takes some time before the exogenously administered creatinine reaches an equilibrium in terms of blood-plasma distribution.

Comparison of the concentrations measured in vVAMS samples with those measured in whole blood should point out whether the VAMS approachin sehas an influence on the determination of iohexol and creatinine. This appeared to be the case, as a negative bias of -12.8% and − 7.2% was observed for iohexol and creatinine, respectively, indicating that the results obtained for vVAMS samples are lower than the corresponding blood results. Also Passing-Bablok regression analysis revealed significant proportional differences for these comparisons (slope of 0.88 for iohexol and 0.92 for creatinine). A possible explanation for this might be that in real, authentic cat samples the extractability differs somewhat from the extractability of artificial, ‘spiked’ samples. An extraction procedure, evaluated and optimized using spiked samples, might still not be fully optimal for the extraction of authentic samples and further optimization might still be possible. Of note, the differences can still be considered acceptable since the acceptance criterion was still met for both iohexol and creatinine (82% and 93% of the differences within ± 20%, respectively). Importantly, the limited spread of the observed differences indicated that this ‘methodological bias’ was consistent, rendering it possible to correct for this difference in a next step.

The effect of capillaryversusvenous sampling was evaluated by comparing the results from VAMS samples prepared from venous blood and VAMS samples prepared from paired capillary blood obtained via ear-prick sampling. For both analytes, a negative bias was found (-7.2% for iohexol and − 4.9% for creatinine). Importantly, the span between the LoAs for the comparison of cVAMSversusvVAMS samples is wider than for the comparison of vVAMS samplesversusliquid blood (51.7% vs. 31.1% for iohexol and 47.4% vs. 32.2% for creatinine, respectively). Also slight, but significant proportional differences were found via Passing-Bablok regression analysis (slope: 0.92 for iohexol and 0.91 for creatinine). These differences and wider spans can primarily be explained by the influence of the first time point samples after administration (t5), as there was inherently always a small delay between the venous blood collection and the ear-prick. Indeed, capillary-venous differences can be anticipated to be more pronounced by a slight delay during the early phase, in which there is a steep decline in the concentration-time curve. Another factor contributing to the wider span might be a somewhat larger imprecision for the analysis of cVAMS samples compared to vVAMS samples generated in the laboratory, as also found earlier by our own group [38–40]. For iohexol, the group of Zwart et al. also found a capillary-venous divergence for early timed samples, which they attributed to a possible incomplete capillary distribution of iohexol at these time points [19].

Considering all the factors contributing to the differences between cVAMS and plasma samples, and the fact that for clinical interpretation plasma-based results are required, it is clear that a conversion formula is needed to convert the results from cVAMS samples to plasma concentrations. For iohexol, we used individual hct-based conversion, as already applied by other groups as well [13,14,16,36,37]. For creatinine, we performed a conversion based on the B/P ratio, as evaluated earlier by our group [33]. Moreover, as a time-dependent trend was found for the B/P ratio, we used the B/P ratios determined at each individual sampling time point to perform a ‘time-dependent’ conversion. Additionally, for both analytes, a constant factor was included in the conversion formula to compensate for the ‘methodological bias’ we observed when comparing the results from vVAMS samples and liquid blood. The established conversion formulas were validated by applying them on an independent dataset containing cVAMS samples and plasma from 40 cats (application study). For both analytes, an excellent agreement was obtained between the calculated (cVAMS-based) and measured plasma concentrations, with a narrow span between the LoA’s. With 94% and 96% of the differences lying within 20% difference for iohexol and creatinine, respectively, the acceptance criterion was amply met. Consequently, our study demonstrates that iohexol and creatinine can be quantified accurately and precisely starting from a cVAMS sample and that, following conversion, the obtained results can be used interchangeably with venous plasma data (the reference). To further evaluate the clinical applicability of (capillary) VAMS sampling, the GFR results calculated from cVAMS samples should be compared to those calculated from the plasma samples (reference) and the impact on the classification (stages) of the patient’s kidney function should be assessed.

We successfully developed, optimized and validated LC-MS/MS assays for the simultaneous quantification of iohexol and creatinine in blood, plasma and VAMS samples. A key challenge was enhancing the ethical and sustainable aspects of the study, which we addressed by reducing reliance on cat blood-based matrices and incorporating microsampling techniques. Comprehensive evaluation of bio-analytical and VAMS-specific validation parameters confirmed compliance with the pre-set validation acceptance criteria.

Through a clinical validation study, we established conversion formulas to reliably obtain cVAMS-derived plasma results, which closely matched directly measured plasma results for both iohexol and creatinine. In conclusion, we demonstrated that ear-prick sampling using VAMS provides a practical and suitable alternative to conventional venous sampling for measuring iohexol and creatinine for GFR estimation in cats.

This VAMS-based sampling protocol not only meets the practitioner’s need for a more convenient method but also enhances animal welfare and ethical standards. Furthermore, it facilitates GFR measurements, which -given the burden of conventional sampling to the cats-are not typically performed in routine practice, enabling early detection of kidney function decline and improving the prognosis for cats.

Ribonucleic acid (RNA) structural motif identification is a crucial step for understanding RNA structure and functionality. Due to the complexity and variations of RNA 3D structures, identifying RNA structural motifs is challenging and time-consuming. Particularly, discovering new RNA structural motif families is a hard problem and still largely depends on manual analysis. In this paper, we proposed an RNA structural motif clustering tool, named GINClus, which uses a semi-supervised deep learning model to cluster RNA motif candidates (RNA loop regions) based on both base interaction and 3D structure similarities. GINClus converts base interactions and 3D structures of RNA motif candidates into graph representations and using graph isomorphism network (GIN) model in combination withK-means and hierarchical agglomerative clustering, GINClus clusters the RNA motif candidates based on their structural similarities. GINClus has a clustering accuracy of 87.88% for known internal loop motifs and 97.69% for known hairpin loop motifs. Using GINClus, we successfully clustered the motifs of the same families together and were able to find 927 new instances of Sarcin-ricin, Kink-turn, Tandem-shear, Hook-turn, E-loop, C-loop, T-loop, and GNRA loop motif families. We also identified 12 new RNA structural motif families with unique structure and base-pair interactions.

Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a single-stranded macromolecule that is responsible for essential cellular functions such as transcription, gene regulation, protein synthesis, and RNA interference. RNA folds into specific three-dimensional conserved regions to participate in different cellular functionalities. The conserved regions occur recurrently in nonhomologous RNA chains, and contain common base-pair interactions, base-stacking interactions, and structure conformation. These recurrent three-dimensional structures are known as RNA structural motifs. RNA structural motifs are structurally very stable and are considered the building blocks of RNA structures [1,2]. According to research, RNA loop regions can act as binding sites for proteins or other molecules [3]. Many recurrent internal loops, hairpin loops, and junction loops embedded within regular helical regions form modular RNA structural motifs [4]. RNA structural motifs have been assigned to different well-known motif families based on their structural similarities [5].

Among different research works related to RNA structural motifs, motif search, classification, and clustering are most common. The existing works so far can be divided into two categories in general. The first category specifically focuses on the geometrical 3D structure comparison to calculate the backbone structure similarity. Apostolicoet al.proposed a geometric shape histogram method to characterize RNA structural motifs at specific locations and later searched for other motifs by comparing the distance between multiple shape histograms [6]. This shape histogram approach along with backbone atom Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) was used by Sargsyanet al.[7] to analyze the distribution of RNA structural motifs along a given RNA chain. To search and identify RNA structural motifs, both PRIMOS [8] and COMPADRES [9] used the concept of “RNA worm” where they used sequentially ordered coordinates of pseudotorsion angles η and θ to define RNA conformation.

The second approach depends on the RNA molecular interactions, as base-pair interactions and base-stacking interactions are highly conserved in the recurrent regions of RNA. Djelloulet al.[10], Zhonget al.[11], and Geet al.[5] used RNA interactions to identify and cluster RNA structural motifs. Both RNAMSC [11] and the extended version of RNAMSC [5] clustered RNA structural motifs using the base-pair interaction-based alignment tool RNAMotifScan. Djelloulet al.[10] also proposed an RNA structural motif clustering approach based on phosphodiester bonds and base-pair interactions. Here, they used graph representation for the RNA tertiary structures and hierarchically clustered secondary structural elements based on a similarity measure, which is calculated by generating the largest extensible common noncanonical subgraph (LENCS) using graph isomorphism algorithm. Apart from [10], both Wanget al.[12] and Harrisonet al.[13] used graph representation to discover similar RNA motif substructures. To find similar structure patterns from RNA 3D database, Wanget al.[12] used a subgraph mining algorithm while NASSAM [13] used subgraph isomorphism algorithm. Oliveret al.[14] proposed VeRNAl that uses graph representation learning along withK-means clustering to identify recurrent fuzzy motifs with similar base pairing. As both backbone conformation and base interaction play important roles in RNA structure formation, focusing on either structure or interaction-based similarity will impose limitations on RNA motif identification. To overcome these limitations, the RNA 3D Motif Atlas introduced a combination of geometric structure and pairwise interaction information in classifying RNA structural motifs [4]. However, they perform all-against-all structural alignment using tool FR3D [15], which can be time-consuming.

Till now, different machine learning methods have been successfully utilized for RNA tertiary structure prediction, RNA–protein binding site prediction, and RNA sequence motif mining [16–18]. Among these methods, graph neural network (GNN) is frequently used in the field of bioinformatics and molecular biology, as GNN can capture the topological and structural information of molecules represented as graphs [19]. However, some variants of GNN fail to distinguish simple graph structures and isomorphic graphs [20]. The graph representation of similar RNA structural motifs can be isomorphic to each other due to their different structural orientations. Hence, for this work, we used graph isomorphism network (GIN), which is a powerful variation of GNN that can distinguish nonisomorphic graphs and has equal discriminative power as the Weisfeiler–Lehman graph isomorphism test [20].

In this paper, we proposed an RNA structural motif clustering tool, named GINClus, for clustering RNA motif candidates using GIN combined withK-means and hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithms. Here, RNA loop regions are considered as RNA motif candidates. GINClus clusters the motif candidates based on both backbone conformation and base interaction similarity where base interaction refers to base-pair interactions and base-stacking interactions. GINClus uses the graph classification model of GIN, which maps graph representations of structural motif candidates in the embedding space as a feature set. Based on this feature set, GINClus first clusters the RNA motif candidates usingK-means clustering, and then subclusters the motif candidates using hierarchical agglomerative clustering. GINClus has an overall clustering accuracy of 87.88% for known internal loop motifs and 97.69% for known hairpin loop motifs. Using GINClus, we generated 406 subclusters for 2656 internal loops and 413 subclusters for 2091 hairpin loops based on their structural similarities. After analyzing these subclusters, we found 81 new Sarcin-ricin (SR), 66 new Kink-turn (KT), 74 new Tandem-shear (TS), 47 new Hook-turn (HT), 92 new E-loop (EL), 102 new C-loop (CL), 85 new T-loop (TL), and 380 new GNRA tetraloop (GL) loop motifs and identified 12 new RNA structural motif families.

Most of the motif classification and clustering work done so far depends on comparative pairwise structural alignment and manual analysis which can be tedious and extremely time-consuming. GINClus is independent of all-against-all pairwise structural motif alignment and therefore is computationally faster in comparison to other existing tools. While most of the existing approaches either rely on motif backbone structure or molecular interactions, GINClus utilizes both of these specifications to distinguish motifs in a detailed and extensive manner. The self-trained, semi-supervised learning nature of GIN model further enables GINClus to accumulate the motifs of an unknown family based on their structural similarity. GINClus generates side-by-side images of motifs for each subcluster to help the users visualize the 3D structure similarities within a subcluster. Thus, GINClus will not only help to understand the existing motif families, it will also be useful in identifying new motif families by developing a structural pattern for unknown motif instances.

GINClus takes the locations of known motifs and motif candidates (loop regions) as input, and converts them into graph representations. Then, the GIN model is trained using the graph representations of known motif instances and using the trained model, an embedded feature set is generated for motif candidates. Finally, using this feature set, the motif candidates are clustered based on their structural similarities. Figure1shows the overall pipeline used by GINClus.

For creating the training dataset of GINClus, we collected known motifs from RNA structural motif families containing at least 30 motif members. Based on this criteria, we found six internal loop motif families known as Sarcin-ricin, Kink-turn, Tandem-shear, Hook-turn, E-loop, and C-loop and two hairpin loop motif families known as T-loop and GNRA tetraloop or GNRA. The locations of 313 well-known internal loop motifs from these six internal loop motif families are collected from Geet al.[5] and RNA 3D Motif Atlas [4] by following the same procedure described in RNAMotifContrast [21]. After manual inspection, 20 internal loop motifs are filtered out due to incorrect motif family annotation, and the remaining 293 internal loop motif instances are used to train and test our model. Similarly, the locations of 403 well-known hairpin loop motifs from TL and GL motif families are collected from Geet al.[5] and RNA 3D Motif Atlas [4]. The distribution of the motif instances is provided in the second column of Table7. All these known internal loop and hairpin loop motif locations provided in RNAMotifContrast [21] were collected from NRList release 3.57 at resolution 4.0 Å [22]. So, to maintain consistency in the NRList versions for known motifs and motif candidates, we used the same NRList release for further data collection. The locations of 2656 internal loops and 2091 hairpin loops, also referred to as motif candidates, are collected from the representative RNA structures in the NRList release 3.57 at resolution 4.0 Å [22]. These larger sets of internal loop and hairpin loop motif candidates also include the known internal loop and hairpin loop motifs. It is also important to note that, hairpin loops, internal loops, and multi-branched loops (multiloops) were found during the loop collection process; however, we did not cluster multiloops using GINClus as enough training data are not available for multiloop motif families.

Summary of clusters generated for motif families known to GINClus (used in GIN model training)

The locations of known RNA structural motifs and RNA motif candidates are provided as input to GINClus. It then downloads the corresponding PDB and FASTA files from the PDB database [23]. For each of these PDB data, it collects FR3D annotations from the “RNA Structure Atlas” website [15] and DSSR annotations either using DSSR annotation tool v1.7.8-2018sep01 [24] or DSSR website [25]. GINClus then merges these two annotation outcomes to obtain a better quality base interaction information for the RNA structures. For some PDB files, conflicts might arise during the merging process when the annotations predict different base-pair interactions at the same site or predict that the same edge of one nucleotide was interacting with edges from two different nucleotides. GINClus resolves these conflicts by comparing the annotations across all nonredundant PDB structures in release 3.57 at 4.0 Å resolution and selecting the base interaction pattern that occurred most frequently. It then creates separate loop files with corresponding nucleotide sequences, base-pair and base-stacking interactions for known motifs and motif candidates. For each known motif and motif candidate, GINClus collects the 3D coordinates from the downloaded PDB files and generates a coordinate file.

From the loop files and coordinate files, GINClus generates graph representations for each motif and motif candidate. These graph representations contain nucleotide distance information represented by a weighted adjacency matrix, nucleotide information as node features, base interaction information as edge features, and motif family information as graph label. The weight in the adjacency matrix represents the distance between two nucleotides, which is calculated by generating the Euclidean distance based on the RMSD values determined for the geometric centers of the backbone atoms of the nucleotides. Six atoms C3′, C4′, C5′, O3′, O5′, and P have been considered as the backbone atoms for each nucleotide [26], and their RMSD value is calculated using the Kabsch algorithm [27]. The nodes represent the nucleotides and node features represent the nucleotide type (adenine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil) using the one-hot encoding technique. Similarly, edge features represent the base-interaction and base-stacking information using the one-hot encoding technique.

Based on thecis(c) ortrans(t) orientation of glycosidic bonds, three base interaction edges (Watson–Crick edge denoted as “W,” Hoogsteen edge denoted as “H,” Sugar edge denoted as “S”), and directions (two different directions of base-pair interactions between two nucleotides), there are 18 different combinations of base-pair interactions:cisW/W,cisW/H,cisH/W,cisW/S,cisS/W,cisH/H,cisH/S,cisS/H,cisS/S,transW/W,transW/H,transH/W,transW/S,transS/W,transH/H,transH/S,transS/H, andtransS/S [28]. Base-stacking represents the relative orientation of two nucleotides with respect to each other and there are four types of base-stacking: upward, downward, inward, and outward [29]. Figure2shows an example of graph representation for the motif 1U9S_A:136-139_161-162. Two edges pointing toward the opposite directions (one inward and one outward), named connection edges, are added between all possible pairs of nodes making it a strongly connected directed graph. The edge feature vector contains information about pairwise nucleotide distance, base-pair interaction and base-stacking. The edge feature vector contains 23 elements in total where the first element contains the nucleotide distance, the next 18 elements contain information about base-pair interaction cWW, cWH, cHW, cWS, cSW, cHH, cHS, cSH, cSS, tWW, tWH, tHW, tWS, tSW, tHH, tHS, tSH, and tSS consecutively and the last four elements indicate information about whether base-stacking is upward, downward, inward, or outward.

The GIN model is implemented using the Spektral [30] python library developed based on TensorFlow and Keras. The GIN model first learns from the known motif instances (training data) that belong to the well-known motif families. These known motifs are represented using graphs where each graph is labeled with its family name. The dataset containing the known motifs are divided into three sets: training, validation, and testing data. We trained the model separately for internal loops and hairpin loops to generate separate datasets for internal loops and hairpin loops. If required, the model can also be trained with internal loops and hairpin loops at the same time. In case of internal loop motifs, there are a total of 293 known motifs where 253 are used for training, 20 used for validation, and 20 used for testing. For hairpin loop motifs, there are 406 known motifs among which, 354 are used for training, 26 used for validation, and 26 used for testing. GINClus was run on a 64-bit Ubuntu 20.04 system with an i7-8700 CPU and 64 GB RAM. The model took 152 seconds to train using 293 internal loops and 284 seconds to train using 406 hairpin loops. In GINClus, the model learns the graph network features by iteratively updating node representations based on the aggregation of its neighbors’ representations using three message-passing hidden perceptron layers. In each layer, the representation of the node is updated using Equation (1) [20].

In this equation,vrepresents the current node,hrepresents the hidden vector,krepresents the layer number,N(v) represents the set of neighbor nodes to nodev, and ε represents a learnable parameter, which is set to 0. Finally, global average pooling is used along with a LeakyReLU activation function for averaging the summation of all node representations from the same iterations to generate feature map for each motif. Here, we used the categorical cross-entropy loss function over softmax activation output to adjust model weights during training. The weight of the model with the highest accuracy is stored to train the GIN model in the next step.

In this step, the previously stored model weight is loaded into the GIN model and feature set is generated for all the motif candidates (RNA loop regions). To generate the feature set, the motif candidates are converted into graph representations and provided as input to the trained GIN model. The GIN model outputs 128 features for each RNA motif candidate. In case of internal loops, after training the model with 293 known motifs, we generated feature set for the 2656 internal loop motif candidates. Similarly for hairpin loops, after training the model with 403 known hairpin loop motifs, we generated the feature set for the 2091 hairpin loop motif candidates. The goal of this process is to generate a numerical feature set from the 3D structure and interaction-based graph representation of each motif candidate. Later, these features are used to cluster the RNA motif candidates based on their structural similarity.

As the performance of clustering algorithms can vary widely based on the data distribution, different classical clustering algorithms such asK-means,K-median, Agglomerative, DBSCAN, Spectral, Gaussian mixture model, and Mean shift have been evaluated using the feature set generated for the 293 known internal loop motif instances. Adjusted Random Index (ARI) [31] and Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) score [32] are used for evaluating the performance of the clustering algorithms. Both ARI and AMI values range between 0 to 1 where 1 indicates that the predicted clustering is highly similar to the original clustering. Table1shows the comparison of the performance of the clustering algorithms based on the known 293 internal loop motif instances. As can be seen from the table, clustering algorithmK-means, agglomerative, spectral, and mean shift have comparatively higher (>0.7) ARI and AMI values. Among them,K-means has the highest ARI value (0.92) with comparatively high AMI value. Hence, theK-means algorithm is selected to cluster the RNA motif candidates using the feature set generated based on their structural attributes.

Performance comparison of different clustering algorithms

K-means is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that dividesN-dimensional data objects intoKnumber of nonoverlapping clusters where the number of clusters (value ofK) has to be predefined [33]. While selecting the value ofK, we had two goals: first, keeping the number of outliers in a cluster low; second, not generating too many clusters to avoid assigning similar motifs to separate clusters. We used evaluating metrics Silhouette Score and Davies–Bouldin Index to determine the number of clusters. Silhouette Score shows how closely connected the points in a cluster are. This ranges from 0 to 1 and a higher value represents better connected clusters. Davies–Bouldin Index represents the average similarity measure of the clusters to the other clusters they are most similar to. Its minimum possible value is 0 and the lower the value, the better the distance within different clusters.

We ran theK-means algorithm on internal loop motif candidates for different values ofKand generated the Silhouette Score and Davies–Bouldin Index as shown in Fig.3. We only consideredKvalues with Single Motif Cluster Ratio (SMCR) < 5% to avoid generating too many clusters containing a single motif. SMCR is calculated by dividing the number of clusters containing single motifs with the number of total clusters. As we can see from Fig.3, for SMCR < 5%, we get the highest Silhouette Score (0.73) and the lowest Davies–Bouldin Index (0.69) forK= 400. So, usingK-means clustering algorithm, the 2656 internal loop motif candidates are divided into 400 clusters based on their structural similarity. Similarly, we determined the value ofKfor hairpin loop motifs and the 2091 hairpin loop motif candidates are divided into 400 clusters usingK-means clustering algorithm. To make sure that the clustering output remains consistent when the same data are clustered multiple times, we set the random initialization state to 0 while runningK-means algorithm.



EvaluatingK-means clustering algorithm performance on internal loop motif candidates for different number of clusters (K).

As the number of clusters is predefined inK-means, there is a possibility of clustering some structurally not so similar motifs in the same cluster. To handle this issue, we further divided the clusters generated usingK-means into subclusters which is the final output generated by GINClus. As the number of clusters is not predefined in the hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm and according to Table1, it has the second highest performance afterK-means, it is selected as the subclustering algorithm. If all the members in a cluster are highly similar, then that cluster will not be divided any further using the subclustering algorithm. However, if there is structural dissimilarity among the members of a cluster, then the subclustering algorithm will divide it into multiple subclusters. Using the agglomerative clustering algorithm, the 2656 internal loops are finally divided into 406 subclusters and the 2091 hairpin loops are finally divided into 413 subclusters. The overall runtime was 490 seconds for internal loops and 477 seconds for hairpin loops using pregenerated loop annotation files. GINClus generates side-by-side and superimposed images of motifs for each subcluster using the open-source 3D structure rendering tool PyMOL [34].

GINClus generatesQ-score (quality score) for each subcluster to evaluate the quality of the subclusters and to expedite subcluster analysis. To generate theQ-score, we determine the motif base interaction similarity using RNAMotifScanX and motif 3D structure similarity using TM-align. For a subclusteri, we generate the average alignment-scoreSXsci, RMSDSXdi, and alignment lengthSXaliusing RNAMotifScanX. Similarly, we generate the average TM-scoreTMsci, RMSDTMdi, and alignment lengthTMaliusing TM-align for subclusteri. Finally, we calculate theQ−scoreifor subclusteriusing Equations2,3, and4. Here,Mirepresents the number of motifs in the subclusteri. For any valueX, hereXmaxrepresents the maximumXvalue among all the subclusters.

To evaluate the contribution of different algorithms in GINClus, we performed an ablation study using 293 known internal loop motifs. As shown in Table2, the accuracy of GIN model is <60% for known internal loop motifs when we apply it based on just base interaction features or just 3D structure features. Combining both features, we get a higher accuracy for GIN model (69%). Again, using only GIN model with both features on 293 internal loop motifs, the precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy is <70%. When we combine GIN with agglomerative clustering (AGL), the overall performance slightly improves. Combining GIN withK-means clustering, the accuracy improves up to 75%. But the performance significantly improves when we use GINClus where we combine GIN model first withK-means to generate clusters and then with AGL to generate subclusters. Using GINClus, the accuracy improved up to 87.88% while precision, recall, and F1-score improved up to 89%, 88%, and 88% respectively for known internal loop motifs.

Ablation study of GINClus model based on known internal loop motifs

In order to test the accuracy of GINClus, we randomly divided the 293 known internal loop motifs collected from the NRList release 3.57 at resolution 4.0 Å [22] into training, validation, and testing data. We used a 5-fold cross-validation technique where we split the input dataset randomly five times and ran the model. Each time, the training, validation, and testing dataset contained 253, 20, and 20 motifs, respectively. For each run, first, we generated the feature set of the test data using GIN model. Then we clustered them usingK-means and subclusterd them using agglomerative clustering algorithm. Finally, comparing the true label with clustering labels, we generated precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of GINClus. Table3shows the precision, recall, F1-score, and support values where the support value for each family represents the number of occurrences in the test dataset. The overall accuracy of GINClus is 87.88% for internal loop motifs.

GINClus performance evaluation on known internal loop motifs

Similarly, as shown in Table4, we evaluated the performance of GINClus on 406 known hairpin loop motifs collected from the nonredundant PDB list (NRList) release 3.57 at resolution 4.0 Å [22] using 5-fold cross-validation where each run contains 354 train, 26 validation, and 26 test data. For hairpin loop motifs, GINClus has an accuracy of 97.69%. The internal loop motif families have structural variations [21] and inter-family similarities [35], while the motifs belonging to hairpin loop motif families are short and have less diversity. So, clustering internal loops can be more challenging than clustering hairpin loops and as a result, GINClus achieves a lower accuracy for internal loops compared to hairpin loops. Figure4shows the confusion matrices for both internal loop motifs and hairpin loop motifs where the rows represent the true labels, the columns represent the predicted labels, the color scale changes from lighter to darker with increasing values, and the diagonal values represent the number of correctly predicted motif instances for each motif family. As we can see from the confusion matrices, in most of the cases, the model can predict the label of the motifs correctly despite the variations within each motif family and their inter-family similarities [35]. Since the known motif families contain a wide range of variation among them [21,35], the training data contain significant amount of variations, which prevents the GIN model in GINClus from overfitting. The high accuracy of GINClus on the testing dataset also validates that the model is not overfitted.

23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) contains many well-defined motifs and hence is popularly used for benchmarking [11,36]. To evaluate the clustering performance of GINClus on 23S rRNA, we collected the known motifs from PDB 1S72 chain 0. From these motifs, we picked the motifs from the SR and KT families, since the other motif families contain less than five motifs. Next, using the previously trained GINClus model (trained using 293 known internal loop motifs), we generated a feature set for these newly picked motifs from PDB 1S72 chain 0 and divided them into subclusters. While running the model, we setK= 4 after evaluatingK-means performance for different numbers of clusters. Table5shows the subcluster output generated by GINClus for the motifs collected from PDB 1S72 chain 0. Since the motifs of the known families have structural variations [21], motifs of SR and KT families are divided into multiple clusters. Also, both SR and KT motifs share structure similarities (similar kink shape) and common base-pair interactions (A-G tH/S and G-A tS/H). So, in some cases, SR and KT motifs have been clustered together (subclusters 2 and 7 in Table5).Supplementary Fig. S1shows base-pair interactions and 3D structures of SR and KT motifs assigned to subclusters 2 and 7 in Table5. However, as we can see from Table5, in most of the cases GINClus is able to separately cluster motifs from SR and KT family. This shows that GINClus can cluster RNA structural motifs collected from any RNA chain.

GINClus clustering output for the known motifs from PDB 1S72 23S rRNA

*Part of a multiloop junction.

To compare the clustering performance of GINClus with other RNA motif clustering methods, we collected a dataset used by both RNAMSC and LENCS. This dataset contains 5S (Haloarcula marismortui, PDB 1S72 chain 9), 16S (Thermus thermophilus, PDB 1J5E chain A), and 23S (Haloarcula marismortui, PDB 1S72 chain 0) rRNAs. We clustered the motifs from this dataset using the previously trained GINClus (trained using 293 known internal loop motifs) and compared the clustering output with RNAMSC, LENCS, and RNA 3D Motif Atlas (release 3.93). The known motif instances from this dataset (shown inSupplementary Table S1) correspond to GNRA, SR, KT, TS, HT, CL, EL, and reverse Kink-turn motifs. The motifs identified by GINClus, RNAMSC, LENCS, and RNA 3D Motif Atlas among these known motifs are marked inSupplementary Table S1. The clusters generated by GINClus that correspond to these known motifs are shown inSupplementary Table S2. The clustering output for LENCS [10] and RNAMSC [11] for these known motifs are collected from their related publications. In case of RNA 3D Motif Atlas, the corresponding known motifs are gathered from their comprehensive collection of motifs [4]. However, as RNA 3D Motif Atlas uses the representative RNA chains from the NRList [22], it contains motifs from PDB 4V9F chain 0 (23S rRNA), PDB 4V9F chain 9 (5S rRNA), and PDB 4LFB chain A (16S rRNA) which, according to NRList release 3.57, are equivalent to PDB 1S72 chain 0, PDB 1S72 chain 9, and PDB 1J5E chain A, respectively. Therefore, we collected the annotated rRNA motifs from PDB 4V9F and 4LFB from RNA 3D Motif Atlas and mapped those motifs to PDB 1S72 and 1J5E, respectively. The motifs with the same known motif annotations are grouped together as shown inSupplementary Table S3. In RNA 3D Motif Atlas, EL motifs are annotated as tSH-tHW-tHS, TS motifs are annotated as triple/double sheared, and HT motifs are annotated as UAA/GAN. The comparison between the clustering results of LENCS, RNAMSC, RNA 3D Motif Atlas, and GINClus for known motifs collected from 5S, 16S, 23S rRNA of PDB 1S72, and 1J5E is summarized in Table6. The two SR motifs (1S72_0:380-384_405-408, 1S72_0:451-467_474-479) that are part of multiloop junctions have been excluded from the comparison with RNA 3D Motif Atlas in Table6as RNA 3D Motif Atlas clusters the loops of varying junctions separately and, therefore, does not identify SR motifs from multiloop junctions. For finding similar RNA motifs, LENCS and RNAMSC can only consider base-pair interactions while RNA 3D Motif Atlas and GINClus can consider both base-pair interactions and 3D structures of motifs. As shown in Table6, GINClus outperforms these motif clustering methods and gains higher sensitivity (SN) and specificity (SP).

We performed statistical analysis on known motif families based on both base interaction and 3D structure similarity to determine how the RMSD values vary among structurally similar motifs. We calculated the range within two standard deviation for the known motif families. Approximately 95% of the known motif pairwise RMSD values fall within this range. So, if any RNA loop pair has RMSD below the upper-bound of this range, then we consider them to be structurally similar. Based on base interaction similarity, the upper-bound of range within two standard deviation is 4.72 Å for internal loops and 2 Å for hairpin loops. Similarly, based on 3D structure similarity, the upper-bound of the range is 2.46 Å for internal loops and 1.55 Å for hairpin loops. After filtering the subclusters that contain single RNA loop, there are a total of 387 internal loop subclusters and 293 hairpin loop subclusters. Based on base-interaction similarity, 92.76% internal loop subclusters and 67.57% hairpin loop subclusters have average pairwise RMSD below the upper-bound of the two standard deviation range. Similarly, 97.67% internal loop subclusters and 84.98% hairpin loop subclusters have average pairwise RMSD below the upper-bound based on 3D structure similarity. This shows that most of our internal loop and hairpin loop subclusters contain RNA loops that are structurally similar to each other.Supplementary Figs S2andS3show the distribution of number of subclusters over average pairwise RMSD value based on both base-interaction and 3D structure similarity for internal loops and hairpin loops, respectively.Supplementary Table S4shows the detailed statistical analysis result on the pairwise RMSD of known motif family loops.

We analyzed the 406 internal loop subclusters and 413 hairpin loop subclusters generated by GINClus to find subclusters that contain motifs from known motif families (KT, SR, TS, HT, EL, CL, GL, and TL) used for training GINClus. We shortlisted the subclusters that contain one or multiple motifs from the given 293 known internal loop and 406 known hairpin loop motif list. We found 238 such subclusters and we analyzed the motif candidates (loop regions) belonging to each of these subclusters. We closely looked at the base-pair interactions and 3D structures of these loops and if they possess structural similarity with any of the known motif families, we considered them as new members of that family. Among those 238 subclusters, if any subcluster has >60% of loop members belonging to a single known motif family, we assigned that subcluster to that specific motif family. The loops in a subcluster that do not share the common features with the majority of the motif members are considered to be the outliers in that subcluster. We also filtered out loops containing missing or conflicting annotations from these subclusters. Following these criteria, we found 23 subclusters belonging to SR motif family, 15 subclusters belonging to KT, 14 subclusters belonging to TS, 11 subclusters belonging to HT, 16 subclusters belonging to CL, 14 subclusters belonging to EL, 19 subclusters belonging to TL, and 42 subclusters belonging to GL. Similar to internal loop and hairpin loop, GINClus can generate clusters for multiloops based on structural similarity. But due to the unavailability of training data for RNA multiloop motif families, we have not evaluated the performance of GINClus on multiloops. Both [4] and [5] proposed some clusters for RNA multiloops. But on average, these clusters contain 5–7 motifs each; this number is too small to train GINClus.

Table7shows a summary of the known motif family subclusters. As we can see from the table, using GINClus, we found 81 new instances of SR, 66 new instances of KT, 74 new instances of TS, 47 new instances of HT, 92 new instances of EL, 102 new instances of CL, 85 new instances of TL, and 380 new instances of GL motif family. For internal loop motif families, Motif clustering accuracy (MCA) is > 70% and for hairpin loop motif families, MCA is > 80%. MCA for each family is calculated by dividing the number of known motifs of a family in the corresponding family clusters by the number of total known motifs for that family. The high MCA values indicate that the proposed GINClus model can successfully cluster together most of the RNA structural motifs of the known motif families of internal loop and hairpin loop.Supplementary Tables S5–S12show the list of motifs belonging to the known motif family subclusters.

As mentioned in RNAMotifContrast [21], RNA structural motifs belonging to the same family have base-pair interaction and structural variations and can be further divided into subfamilies. Due to their variations, the motifs from the same family are divided into multiple subclusters.Supplementary Table S13shows that SR motif family contains 23 corresponding subclusters and base-pair interaction variations exist within these subclusters. While analyzing the variations, we did not consider the outliers within SR subclusters (only considered either previously known or new instances of SR motifs). From the table, we can see that most of the SR subclusters have an average RMSD < 2Å and average alignment length ≥ 6. This further shows how highly structure-wise similar the motifs are within each SR subcluster. Overall, GINClus is not only capable of clustering motifs from known families, it can also capture the variations within known motif families which can be overlooked by alignment-based motif searching tools.

As mentioned before, GINClus employs the graph isomorphism neural network (GIN), which uses semi-supervised learning. So, it is capable of clustering RNA structural motifs from families that it was not trained with. To assess the performance of GINClus in clustering RNA structural motif families that it is not familiar with, we focused on motif families reverse Kink-turn, Tetraloop-receptor, L1-complex, and Rope-sling. These motif families have not been used in training GINClus as these families did not contain enough training data. Since reverse Kink-turn, Tetraloop-receptor, L1-complex, and Rope-sling are all internal loop motif families, we analyzed the 406 internal loop subclusters to asses the performance of GINClus. We used the same criteria that we previously used for finding corresponding subclusters for the known motif families. From Table8, we can see that the GINClus model can successfully cluster motifs from the families reverse Kink-turn, Tetraloop-receptor, and L1-complex with an MCA ≥ 80%. This proves that GINClus is capable of clustering RNA structural motifs from families that it was not trained with. However, the model did not perform well in case of Rope-sling (MCA < 50%). According to the definition provided by [11], Rope-sling motifs generally have two nucleotides on one side and a long strand on the other side with a cS/H bond between two consecutive nucleotides. Since many other RNA structural motif instances also have a short strand-long strand structure and contain the cS/H bond between two consecutive nucleotides, it’s hard for GINClus to separate Rope-sling motifs from other motif instances. This explains the reason for its poor performance in case of Rope-sling. The lists of subclusters belonging to these four motif families are shown inSupplementary Tables S14–S17.

Summary of clusters generated for motif families unknown to GINClus (not used in GIN model training)

Since GINClus can successfully cluster RNA structural motifs of families unknown to its GIN model, the output subclusters might contain potential new RNA structural motif families. To test this theory, we analyzed the output 406 subclusters of internal loops separately based on base interaction and 3D structure similarity. For base interaction similarity, we first sorted all the 406 subclusters based on their average alignment-score (high to low), RMSD (low to high), and alignment length (high to low) generated using the tool RNAMotifScanX. Then, we filtered out the previously identified known motif family subclusters from the sorted list. Finally, we selected the top 10 subclusters from the sorted list to check if there are any potential new motif families. After analyzing the top 10 subclusters, we found two new RNA structural motif families which we are referring to as Double-kink-turn (subclusters 53, 226, and 269) and 3-point-turn (subcluster 377) as shown in Table9. We also found four new subclusters (subclusters 174, 184, 288, and 294) for SR family and two new subclusters (subclusters 238 and 321) for KT family. These subclusters have not been identified before as they did not contain any motif from the 293 known motif instances.Supplementary Table S18shows the list of motifs belonging to these top 10 subclusters identified based on base interaction similarity. The motifs of the Double-kink-turn family have a short strand with four nucleotides and a long strand with 14 nucleotides with the base-pairs G-G tW/H, U-A tW/H, and G-A tS/H in the long strand. These motifs also contain base-pairs A-A tH/S, A-A cS/W, A-A tH/H, and G-G tS/S between the two strands. We named it Double-kink-turn because the 3D structure of these motifs contain two kink-shaped bends. The motifs from the new 3-point-turn motif family have two long strands and three consecutive tH/W bonds between the two strands. They also contain a cH/W bond that forms a two nucleotide UA bulge with a tH/W base-pair interaction. We named this family 3-point-turn because the 3D structure of the motifs take turns at three points.

Top 10 motif families based on base interaction similarity and top 10 motif families based on 3D structure similarity

aAS refers to alignment-score, andbAL refers to alignment length.

We followed a similar process to find new RNA families based on 3D structure similarity. We sorted the 406 subclusters based on average TM-score (high to low), RMSD (low to high), and alignment length (high to low) generated by 3D structure alignment tool RNA-align, filtered out the previously identified known motif family subclusters, and selected the top 10 subclusters. After analyzing the top 10 subclusters, we proposed 10 new motif families based on similar structural features as shown in Table9. Among these, the families Anchor-loop (23 motifs) and Bow-loop (19 motifs) contained a high number of motif members and so, we are going to discuss their structural features. The Anchor-loop family (subcluster 11) motifs have a 3D structure shaped like an anchor and they contain the base-pairs G-U tS/H and G-A cS/H. The structure of the motifs from the Bow-loop family (subcluster 20) slightly look like archery bows and they contain the base-pair interaction A-G tH/S. Figure5shows the base-pair interactions and 3D structures of example motifs for the families double-KT, 3-point-turn, Anchor-loop, and Bow-loop. The list of motifs belonging to the top 10 subclusters identified based on 3D structure similarity is shown inSupplementary Table S19. In total, we proposed 12 new RNA structural motif families based on base interaction and 3D structure similarity.



Panels (A–D) show the base-pair interaction (top) and 3D structure (bottom) of example motifs from the families double-KT, 3-point-turn, anchor-loop, and bow-loop, respectively.

In this paper, we clustered RNA loops from NRList release 3.57 which contained 2656 internal loops and 2091 hairpin loops. Since the number of RNA structures at RCSB PDB [23] are increasing at a rapid rate, NRList has newer versions containing higher number of RNA structures. To generate clustering output for newer version of data, we collected RNA loops from NRList release 3.364 (released on 4 December 2024). From NRList release 3.364, we collected 13866 internal loops and 9358 hairpin loops. Using GINClus, a total of 974 subclusters were generated for the internal loops and 667 subclusters were generated for the hairpin loops. The new clustering output (NRList release 3.364) along with the previously generated clustering output (NRList release 3.57) are available on GitHub.

GINClus is a highly efficient and easy-to-use RNA structural motif clustering tool. It is independent of pairwise structural motif alignment and comparison, which makes it computationally efficient. The motifs belonging to the same family can have similar base interactions and/or 3D structures, so considering just base interaction or 3D structure can limit the search or clustering results and increase the number of false negatives. GINClus takes into consideration both the base interactions and the 3D structures of RNA motifs. As a result, it can find more motif instances of an RNA structural motif family and capture the variations that exist within the family. The ability of the GIN model to differentiate nonisomorphic graphs enables the tool GINClus to recognize motifs with similar structures irrespective of different node order representations. GINClus has the capability to find new motif instances of existing motif families as well as motif instances of new RNA structural motif families. As shown in the study, GINClus is successfully able to cluster the motif families known to GINClus (SR, KT, TS, HT, EL, CL, TL, and GL) with an MCA ≥ 70% and the motif families unknown to GINClus (reverse Kink-turn, Tetraloop-receptor, and L1-complex) with an MCA ≥ 80%. Using the clustering output generated by GINClus, we identified 12 new RNA structural motif families. It also generates side-by-side images of RNA structural motifs within a subcluster which makes it easier for users to visualize and analyze the clustering output.

The RNA structure research field is highly evolving and new RNA structural motif instances are being discovered on a regular basis. GINClus can be trained with these newly evolving RNA structural motif instances and families which makes it a highly scalable and adaptive tool. The clustering output generated by GINClus can be analyzed further to find conserved RNA regions with similar secondary and tertiary features and similar functionality. This will pave the way towards easily and efficiently finding new RNA structural motif families based on both structural and functional similarities. One limitation of the GINClus tool is that its performance depends on the availability of high quality training data. In future, we plan to include the newly found motif instances by GINClus in the training dataset and preprocess the training data to improve data quality which might further improve the performance of the tool. GINClus has the ability to handle internal loops, hairpin loops, and multiloops. However, in this paper, we only clustered internal loops and hairpin loops using GINClus as enough training data are not available for clustering multiloops. Overall, GINClus can make significant contributions to the field of RNA structure by making RNA structural motif clustering process way more efficient and simplified, and by introducing new RNA structural motif families with specific structural features and functionalities.

The increasing demand for sustainable agricultural practices prompts a reevaluation of feeding strategies in ruminant nutrition. Agricultural waste, often viewed as a by‐product, presents a promising opportunity to enhance the sustainability of livestock production systems. This review explores the potential of incorporating various agricultural by‐products into ruminant diets. Utilizing these by‐products reduces the environmental impact of livestock farming and contributes to the circular economy by recycling nutrients back into the food system. The nutritional composition of these wastes varies widely, and their inclusion in ruminant diets improves feed efficiency, animal performance and overall health. Research indicates that specific treatments, such as fermentation and ensiling, enhance the digestibility and nutrient availability of these materials. Moreover, incorporating agricultural waste into ruminant nutrition leads to financial benefits for farmers by reducing reliance on conventional feed sources.

Future research focuses on innovative processing techniques, effective management of anti‐nutritional factors, and assessing long‐term impacts on animal health and productivity.

The global demand for livestock products is steadily increasing due to population growth and changing dietary preferences, leading to an urgent need for sustainable agricultural practices. Ruminants, including cattle, sheep and goats, play a crucial role in the agricultural economy by converting fibrous plant materials into high‐quality protein sources for human consumption (Palmonari et al.2021; Koakoski et al.2024). However, traditional feeding practices depend on conventional feedstuffs, which can be costly and harmful to the environment. In this context, the utilization of agricultural by‐products (BPs) as feed ingredients presents a promising solution to enhance the sustainability of ruminant nutrition (Cavallini et al.2021). Agricultural BPs, such as crop residues, fruit and vegetable waste and agro‐industrial BPs, are generated in large quantities worldwide. In 2021, the United Nations estimated that approximately 931 million tons of food waste were produced globally, representing 17% of the total food production worldwide (Thaore et al.2024). This waste mainly originated from households, retail outlets and the food service industry (Thaore et al.2024). Additionally, food leftovers are nutritious, highly digestible and safe feed ingredients that can significantly enhance the environmental sustainability of livestock by providing suitable dietary options for both monogastric and ruminant animals (Pinotti et al.2021). These BPs are often underutilized and disposed of, leading to environmental concerns such as greenhouse gas emissions and soil degradation (Vastolo et al.2024). The proper utilization of these BPs not only enhances ruminant nutrition but also mitigates environmental impacts by reducing agricultural waste disposal, which, in turn, lessens greenhouse gas emissions and soil degradation. Furthermore, by incorporating these materials into ruminant diets, farmers can not only reduce waste but also improve the nutritional value of their feed, thereby enhancing animal performance and health (Nath et al.2023; Vastolo et al.2024). Additionally, the inclusion of botanical supplements and BPs could serve as a viable alternative to antibiotics for promoting growth within the poultry sector (Jalal et al.2024). Research has shown that agricultural BPs can provide essential nutrients, including fibre, protein and energy, which are vital for ruminant growth and productivity (Akram and Fırıncıoğlu2019). For example, crop residues, like corn stover and wheat straw, have been demonstrated to be effective feed sources when treated appropriately to enhance their digestibility (Akram and Fırıncıoğlu2019). Furthermore, the fermentation of fruit and vegetable waste can improve its nutritional profile, making it a viable feed option for ruminants (Sinthuja et al.2023). A review indicates that when incorporated in appropriate and sufficient quantities, BPs can enhance the quality characteristics of meat, particularly regarding its nutritional, sensory and emotional aspects (Pinotti et al.2023). The incorporation of BPs, such as distiller's grains and oilseed meals, has also been shown to improve the protein content of ruminant diets, leading to better growth rates and feed conversion efficiency (Nath et al.2023). However, the literature reports that BPs, mainly distiller's grains, may pose risks related to pesticide and phytotherapeutic residue (Gasparini et al.2024). Furthermore, research indicates that substituting 11%–16% of energy‐dense feed crops, such as cereals and cassava, with agricultural BPs can save approximately 15.4–27.8 million hectares of land, as well as between 3 and 19.6 km3of blue water and 74.2–137.8 km3of green water for cultivating alternative food crops (Govoni et al.2023). This approach presents a viable strategy for mitigating the unsustainable exploitation of natural resources, both locally and through the virtual trade of land and water, thereby promoting more sustainable solutions for enhancing animal diets by recycling agricultural waste (Govoni et al.2023). Despite the potential benefits, the inclusion of agricultural BPs into ruminant diets poses several challenges. Variability in the nutritional composition of these materials, the presence of anti‐nutritional factors and the need for appropriate processing techniques are critical considerations that must be addressed. For instance, certain BPs may contain high levels of tannins or lignin, which can negatively impact digestibility and nutrient absorption. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the nutritional value and recommended inclusion proportions of agricultural BPs is essential for developing effective feeding strategies. Moreover, the economic implications of using agricultural BPs cannot be overlooked. The increasing costs of traditional feed ingredients have led farmers to look for alternative sources that are both cost‐effective and environmentally sustainable. Utilizing agricultural BPs can result in substantial economic advantages, which, in turn, enhances the profitability of livestock production (Nath et al.2023). Additionally, using local agricultural waste can lower transportation costs and decrease the carbon footprint related to feed sourcing. Furthermore, a literature review indicated that rabbit performance, meat quality, immune response and overall health can be influenced by fruit and plant BPs, as well as their essential oils (Abd El‐Aziz et al.2024). Additionally, animal feeds constitute approximately 60%–70% of the variable production expenses in intensive livestock operations (Salami et al.2019). Currently, livestock producers are facing reduced profitability, primarily due to rising global prices of traditional feed sources. The incorporation of low‐input feed materials, such as agri‐BPs, has the potential to mitigate feed costs and enhance the economic viability of livestock farmers, particularly in arid regions that heavily rely on imported grains (Salami et al.2019). Furthermore, the incorporation of agricultural BPs, particularly those containing tannins and phenolic contents, into ruminant diets not only enhances feed efficiency and animal performance but also significantly reduces methane emissions and feed costs, thereby promoting environmental sustainability and contributing to the circular economy in livestock production systems (Manoni et al.2024,2023; Khejornsart et al.2024). This article investigates sustainable approaches for integrating agricultural BPs into ruminant diets, focusing on their advantages, challenges and future research directions. Transforming waste into feed allows the livestock industry to contribute significantly to a more sustainable food system, promoting environmental stewardship while meeting the growing demand for animal protein. Future studies should explore innovative processing methods, such as fermentation and ensiling, to enhance the nutritional value of these BPs and evaluate their long‐term impacts on animal health and productivity. Additionally, this review assesses commonly used BPs in animal feed, including pomegranate, grape, pistachio, saffron, raisin, olive and tomato, with an analysis of recent scientific literature to elucidate their nutritional benefits and health implications for livestock.

The pomegranate, scientifically designated asPunica granatumL., is a remarkable species belonging to the family Punicaceae. It can take the form of either a deciduous shrub or a small tree and is widely grown in many different regions, especially in the Middle East, Iran, several European countries and Southeast Asia. This cultivation has garnered significant agricultural and economic importance (El‐Hadary and Taha2020). Pomegranate fruit is widely used in the fruit processing and beverage industries, especially for creating juices and soft drinks. However, this production process unintentionally creates a significant amount of low‐cost, non‐edible waste derived from fruit, mainly consisting of peels and seeds. Although they are frequently neglected, these BPs are rich in important bioactive compounds (Das et al.2021). All parts of the pomegranate plant, such as its leaves, stems, fruits, bark and roots, contain a wide range of bioactive compounds. These include a diverse range of phenolic compounds, such as hydrolysable tannins (including pedunculagin, punicalin and punicalagin), as well as ellagic and gallic acids. Additionally, flavonoids like catechins and anthocyanins, along with other complex flavonoids and polysaccharides, are also present (Quideau et al.2011; Smaoui et al.2019; Ain et al.2023). This fruit, commonly referred to as the ‘seeded apple’ or ‘granular apple’, is highly regarded and consumed globally due to its delightful flavour, impressive nutritional profile and numerous medicinal properties that have been well‐documented in various scholarly works (Pathak et al.2016). These discarded BPs can be repurposed as functional food ingredients, food additives, nutraceuticals and dietary supplements, helping to boost the phenolic content in human diets, which are increasingly acknowledged for their health benefits (Pathak et al.2016; Gullón et al.2020). Different parts of pomegranate and its BPs are exhibited in Figure1. In this figure, various sections of the pomegranate fruit are illustrated, along with the extraction of its juice and the production of oil from pomegranate seeds.

Notably, these bioactive compounds are characterized not only by their natural origins but also by their demonstrated antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Research has shown that these properties positively influence the quality, safety and longevity of various food products, ranging from oils (El‐Hadary and Taha2020) to meat (Natalello et al.2020; Kazemi and Valizadeh2021; Nemati et al.2024), fish (Yu et al.2022) and even dairy products such as cheese, curd and various forms of fermented milk (Kandylis and Kokkinomagoulos2020). Additionally, a study has confirmed the positive effects of pomegranate macerate on sheep gastrointestinal nematodes (Castagna et al.2024). Recently, a study focused on reducing the negative effects of pomegranate peel (PP) tannins on fattening lambs by utilizing tannase‐producing bacteria (Chaji and Jahanara2023). The findings indicated that treating PP with tannin‐degrading bacteria was more advantageous than leaving the raw PP untreated (Chaji and Jahanara2023). Furthermore, employing these bacteria offers an effective strategy for lowering tannin levels, which enhances the nutritional quality of PP for ruminants (Chaji and Jahanara2023). In addressing the anti‐nutritional factors present in agricultural BPs, such as tannins and lignin, it is crucial to explore specific solutions that can mitigate their adverse effects. Enzymatic treatments, such as the use of tannase and ligninase, have been shown to effectively reduce the levels of tannins and lignin, thereby enhancing the nutritional value of feed (FAO/IAEA2000; Grgas et al.2023). Additionally, microbial fermentation has emerged as a promising approach, where specific strains of bacteria and fungi can degrade these compounds, making nutrients more bioavailable (Salas‐Millán and Aguayo2024). For instance, the fermentation of BPs usingAspergillus nigerhas demonstrated significant reductions in tannin content, leading to improved digestibility in livestock (Ikusika et al.2024). These methods not only improve the nutritional profile of the feed but also contribute to the sustainability of livestock farming by utilizing agricultural waste more effectively. A study examined the effects of adding dietary pomegranate pulp to a total mixed ration (TMR) for Ghezel lambs, focusing on growth performance, blood parameters, carcass traits, meat quality and shelf life (Nemati et al.2024). The findings suggested that adding pomegranate pulp to the diet of Ghezel lambs positively impacts animal performance and meat quality. Specifically, there was an increase in carcass weight, higher concentrations of intramuscular fat and elevated levels of both mono‐ and polyunsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs, PUFAs) (Nemati et al.2024). Additionally, the study observed higher total unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) content and an improved ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids (SFAs) in the meat (Nemati et al.2024). The use of pomegranate pulp also resulted in lower fat and ash content in the liver, as well as enhancements in the oxidative status (as measured by thiobarbituric acid‐reactive substances) and quality attributes of the meat, including water‐holding capacity, colour and pH (Nemati et al.2024). Some researchers have suggested that adding 4% pomegranate seed oil to the diet of fattening lambs may improve the levels of specific PUFAs and lower then‐6/n‐3 fatty acid ratio in the fat of the carcass (Karampour et al.2024). This addition appears to have no negative impact on the lambs’ fattening performance, carcass features or the stability of meat colour (Karampour et al.2024). The findings of a study indicated that supplements of vitamin C, organic selenium, betaine and PP effectively reduce heat stress. Additionally, these supplements positively affect cecal fermentation, the composition of microbiota, antioxidant levels and the overall performance of rabbits (Abu Hafsa et al.2024). In another study, the impact of water‐extracted PP on ruminal protein degradation and post‐ruminal digestion in dairy cows was assessed (Abarghuei et al.2020). The inclusion of PP extract reduced the acetate:propionate ratio and ammonia nitrogen production after 24 h of incubation. Additionally, the total number of protozoa, specifically the generaDasytrichaandIsotricha, along with the subfamilies Entodiniinae, Diplodiniinae and Ophrioscolecinae, decreased with increasing dietary concentrations of PP extract. Higher levels of PP extract were associated with a reduction in the numbers of proteolytic bacteria (Abarghuei et al.2020). These findings indicate that all levels of PP extract supplementation diminish protozoal populations and lower ammonia nitrogen concentrations. Furthermore, all concentrations of PP extract reduced protein degradation in the rumen, whereas no significant effects on crude protein (CP) degradation were observed in the total digestive tract (Abarghuei et al.2020). Integrating agricultural BPs, such as pomegranate BPs, into the diet at concentrations between 5% and 40% of DM generally does not negatively impact milk, fat or protein production. This highlights the ability of these feeds to serve as substitutes for concentrates, thereby improving both economic and environmental sustainability and reducing competition for food resources between humans and animals (Correddu et al.2023). The effects of partially replacing forage and concentrate with pomegranate pulp silage (PPS) and dried pomegranate seed pulp (PSP) on the performance, dry matter intake (DMI) and carcass characteristics of fattening Mehraban lambs were evaluated (Ghoreishi et al.2021). The results showed that both PPS and PSP are effective alternatives for partially substituting the diet of fattening lambs, leading to lower dietary costs without negatively impacting animal performance (Ghoreishi et al.2021). In another study, 24 male lambs were chosen to compare the effects of a diet containing PSP at a level of 100 g/kg of dietary dry matter (DM; PSP100) with a control diet that excluded PSP (Obeidat2023). The results indicated that nutrient intake was significantly higher in lambs fed the PSP100 diet compared to those on the control diet. Additionally, both nitrogen intake and nitrogen retention were greater in the lambs that consumed the PSP100 diet. The final weight, total gain and average daily gain (ADG) were also superior in the lambs receiving PSP100. Both hot and cold carcass weights were significantly higher in the PSP100 group compared to the control group. Furthermore, carcass cut weights increased with the PSP100 diet (Obeidat2023). The authors concluded that adding PSP to lamb diets positively improved growth and carcass characteristics without negatively impacting the health of the lambs. Therefore, they recommend using PSP as an alternative to traditional feeds in formulated rations for lambs (Obeidat2023). In another study, the effect of including whole pomegranate BPs (WPB) in the lamb diet on meat flavour was investigated (Natalello et al.2023). The researchers observed an increase in total PUFAs, as well as levels of vaccenic and rumenic acids, in lambs that received 200 g/kg DM of WPB (Natalello et al.2023). Additionally, they found that most volatile compounds resulting from lipid degradation, such as aldehydes, alcohols, ketones and hydrocarbons, were present in higher concentrations in the meat from WPB‐fed lambs compared to the control group, with the exception of 2‐pentanone, which was found in greater amounts in the control meat (Natalello et al.2023). Although the smart nose technology successfully distinguished between the dietary treatments, the consumer panel did not identify any significant differences in meat flavour (Natalello et al.2023). The incorporation of PP into diets supplemented with fish oil or fat enriched with palmitic acid resulted in enhanced feed intake and antioxidant capacity. However, no interactions were observed concerning oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in dairy cows (Akhlaghi et al.2022). It was shown that lambs fed a mixture of pomegranate powder and laurel bay leaf powder (LLP) exhibited better performance than those receiving only 1% LLP, without negatively impacting biochemical blood parameters (Abdulzahrah and Al‐Wazeer2022). A study was conducted to examine the effects of three levels of dietary pomegranate BP extract (PBE) (100, 150 and 200 mg) on the carcass characteristics, growth performance, nutrient digestibility and selected blood parameters of New Zealand White rabbits (Hassan et al.2020). The findings indicated that supplementing rabbit diets with PBE at concentrations of 100, 150 and 200 mg/kg significantly enhanced both growth performance and nutrient digestibility. Additionally, PBE demonstrated antioxidant and antibacterial effects in the growing rabbits (Hassan et al.2020). It has been reported that the intensive farming methods used in rabbit production can create environmental problems and compromise animal welfare, especially when inadequate management of agricultural waste occurs (El‐Sabrout et al.2024). The study examined the effects of dietary pomegranate seed cake (PSC) as a replacement for corn and barley grains on several parameters. These included productive traits, carcass characteristics, the composition of intramuscular and subcutaneous fatty acids and the antioxidant status of the meat (Kotsampasi et al.2021). The findings suggest that PSC can partially replace cereals in the diets of growing lambs without negatively affecting their performance or quantitative carcass traits. Furthermore, the supplementation of PSC in the diet appears to enhance the nutritional and functional qualities of both meat and subcutaneous fat, as evidenced by an increase in essential fatty acids, particularlytrans‐10,cis‐12 C18:2. Specifically, low levels of PSC inclusion may have a positive influence on the antioxidant potential, as well as the nutritional and functional quality of the meat. However, higher inclusion levels (particularly 235 g/kg of concentrate) may lead to adverse effects (Kotsampasi et al.2021). Pomegranate leaves have considerable nutritional value for ruminants and can be ensiled with yogurt or molasses to improve their digestive and fermentation properties in both silage and ruminal environments (Kazemi et al.2022). The techniques of fermentation and ensiling are critical in enhancing the digestibility and nutrient availability of agricultural BPs (Yang et al.2021). Fermentation, a process involving the microbial conversion of organic substrates, has been shown to significantly increase the bioavailability of nutrients (Knez et al.2023). For instance, studies indicate that fermentation can improve protein digestibility by up to 25% due to the breakdown of anti‐nutritional factors (Çabuk et al.2018). Similarly, ensiling, which involves the anaerobic preservation of forage, can enhance the nutritional profile of feed by promoting the growth of beneficial microorganisms such asLactobacillus plantarum, which aids in the fermentation process (Yang et al.2020; Jin et al.2024). However, it is essential to address the challenges associated with these processing methods. The costs associated with establishing fermentation or ensiling facilities can be a barrier for many producers, particularly in small‐scale operations. Additionally, scalability remains a concern, as the successful implementation of these techniques often requires specific conditions that may not be feasible in all settings. A balanced view of these methods must consider both their benefits and limitations. To ensure clarity for a broader audience, it is important to define technical terms. The use of pomegranate fruit peel as a substitute for antibiotic growth promoters in poultry nutrition shows significant potential. Research indicates that PP can effectively improve the health and growth of poultry while reducing the side effects associated with the use of antibiotics (Abdelhafez et al.2015; Hafeez et al.2023). PP not only supports growth but also enhances immune responses, extends the shelf life of meat, improves egg quality and increases nutrient availability. Additionally, it contributes to better bone quality and reduces the emission of odorous gases from poultry manure, likely due to its abundant antioxidant properties and bioactive compounds such as phenols and tannins (Akuru et al.2020). Research has demonstrated that incorporating extracts from pomegranate and grape wastes at concentrations of 0%, 2%, 4% and 6% into chilled poultry carcasses can enhance preservation and prolong shelf life, maintaining acceptable quality standards for up to 9 days under suitable storage conditions (Javanmard Dakheli2020). Furthermore, the use of pomegranate extracts in slaughterhouses may serve as an environmentally friendly, natural and safe decontamination method within a comprehensive food safety system (Javanmard Dakheli2020). Investigations on the use of pomegranate BPs in animal diets are shown in Table1. The findings of a study suggested that the inclusion of a blend ofMoringa oleiferaleaf meal and PP powder in quail diets could provide considerable benefits for growth and overall health (Maqsood et al.2024). The chemical compositions of DM, ash, CP, ether extract (EE), total sugars, neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF) and lignin in the peel and seeds of pomegranate were found to be 32.4% versus 20% for DM (peel vs. seed), 3.59% versus 2.47% for ash, 3.80% versus 7.17% for CP, 1.60% versus 1.55% for EE, 42.7% versus 75.3% for total sugars, 26.7% versus 12.8% for NDF, 18.6% versus 8.64% for ADF and 6.80% versus 3.90% for lignin, respectively (de Evan et al.2024). The metabolizable energy (ME) values for the seeds and peel of pomegranate were reported as 11 and 7.43 MJ/kg DM, respectively (de Evan et al.2024). Additionally, another study reported the following percentages for moisture, ash, carbohydrates, protein, total fat, crude fibre, total phenolic contents (TPCs) and various mineral contents in PP: 7.27% moisture, 4.3% ash, 66.51% carbohydrates, 3.74% protein, 0.85% total fat, 17.31% crude fibre and TPCs of 18.75 mg/g, with calcium, magnesium, sodium, phosphorus, iron, zinc, manganese and copper measured at 342, 148.64, 64.63, 118.3, 6.35, 0.93, 0.78 and 0.64 mg/100 g, respectively (Azmat et al.2024). Furthermore, the PSP contained 94.0% DM, 17.8% CP, 34.3% NDF, 20.3% ADF and 11.3% EE (Obeidat et al.2024). A study conducted by Hagag et al. (2023) identified the contents of CP, moisture, ash and EE as 17.51%, 13.80%, 4.40% and 3.65% of DM, respectively. TPCs in animal feed have been shown to positively impact the health and performance of ruminants (Bešlo et al.2022). These compounds can enhance the fermentation process in the rumen, leading to improved nutrient utilization and growth performance (Manoni et al.2023). Moreover, TPC has been associated with a reduction in methane emissions, a significant greenhouse gas produced during ruminant digestion (Manoni et al.2024,2023). By modulating the microbial population in the rumen, phenolic and polyphenolic compounds can decrease methanogenic activity, thus contributing to more sustainable livestock production (Teng et al.2024). Overall, incorporating high levels of TPCs in ruminant diets can lead to both environmental and production benefits.

Ensiling effectively preserves feed quality by enhancing fermentation, reducing spoilage and improving nutrient availability for livestock. In this regard, co‐ensiling PP with berseem improves silage quality by reducing silage pH, ammonia nitrogen and butyric acid levels and increasing DM and non‐fibre carbohydrates (NFCs) (Ahmed et al.2025).

The grapevine (Vitis viniferaL.) is a globally significant agricultural species, widely cultivated for its economic value and diverse product offerings, including raisins, fruit juice, vinegar, seed oils, table grapes and wine (Daler2024). On the other hand, approximately 75% of global grape production is allocated to the wine industry, with the remaining 25% composed of skins, seeds and stalks, which represent the total weight of grapes utilized in winemaking (Wang et al.2020; Quagliardi et al.2024). Seedless pomace accounts for about 48%–62% of total grape pomace (GP), serving as a source of dietary fibre and phenolic compounds, whereas seeds constitute approximately 38%–52%, primarily providing oils rich in UFAs (Beres et al.2017). A form of GBs after juicing is shown in Figure2. In this figure, the various parts of the grape fruit, including the pulp, skin, seed and stalk, are highlighted. Each of these components can be considered BPs and utilized in animal feed. The highest concentrations of phenolic compounds, including strong antioxidant, cytotoxic and antibacterial properties, are found in the seeds. In contrast, the skins contain elevated levels ofp‐coumaric acid hexoside and anthocyanins (Peixoto et al.2018). Given these factors, GBs can be utilized as dietary supplements, acting as nutraceuticals, foods or ingredients that provide medical or health benefits (Quagliardi et al.2024). These BPs are abundant in phytonutrients, plant‐derived compounds and, more specifically, phytochemical bioactive plant‐derived compounds linked to positive health outcomes (Frank et al.2020; Quagliardi et al.2024). For instance, GP can be utilized to produce extracts with antioxidant properties and as fermentation substrates due to its high content of bioactive compounds demonstrating significant antioxidant activity, including various polyphenols (such as anthocyanins, flavanols, flavan‐3‐ols and procyanidins), phenolic acids, resveratrol and dietary fibre (Caponio et al.2023). It is one of the most widely cultivated crops, thanks to its many nutritional advantages, which are largely due to its high concentration of polyphenols (Turcu et al.2021). BPs, like GP, seeds and grape seed oil (GSO), represent valuable but often underutilized resources for ruminants and poultry (Costa et al.2022). These BPs are rich in fibre and bioactive phenolic compounds, which render them promising alternatives to conventional, unsustainable feed components. Unfortunately, GBs are often discarded or improperly utilized, leading to negative environmental consequences (Costa et al.2022). Grape seeds make up about 15%–52% of DM in GP and have a complex chemical structure that is affected by various ecological factors, including the conditions of grape cultivation and harvesting time (Teixeira et al.2014). They generally consist of approximately 40% fibre (mainly cellulose), 16% essential oils, 11% protein and 7% polyphenols (which include flavanols, anthocyanins, phenolic acids and resveratrol) (Antunović et al.2024). They also contain minerals, sugars and antioxidant compounds like β‐carotene (Antunović et al.2024). Major minerals found in grape seeds include iron and copper; however, their application in food is limited due to high lignin content, as well as ADF and NDF levels. Additionally, grape seeds are a good source of vitamin E, contributing to their elevated antioxidant properties (Antunović et al.2024). In poultry nutrition, the effect of adding GBs in feed has been shown to depend on dosage and form. Typically, GBs are included at rates of up to 6%–10% of the feed (DM basis) (Erinle and Adewole2022). Elevated levels of these BPs may result in substantial concentrations of anti‐nutritional compounds, such as fibre and polymeric polyphenols (e.g., proanthocyanidins), which can impede nutrient digestion and absorption, ultimately affecting weight gain negatively. Conversely, lower inclusion rates (less than 6% feed) have been associated with beneficial bioactive effects, including improved gut morphology, modulation of gut microbiota and enhanced antioxidant activity, primarily due to polyphenol presence (Erinle and Adewole2022). GBs have been utilized across various livestock species to evaluate their beneficial properties. The most commonly studied animals include dairy cows (Signor et al.2024), fattening lambs (Elsheikh et al.2024), lactating goats (Badiee Baghsiyah et al.2023), beef cattle (Molosse et al.2023), dairy ewes (Buffa et al.2020; Bennato et al.2022), horses (Kolláthová et al.2020; Kolláthová2021) and rabbits (Derbali et al.2024; Romelle Jones et al.2024).



Grape by‐products after juicing.

It was observed that feeding broilers 1%–4% grape seeds enhanced the growth ofLactobacilluswhile decreasing the populations of harmfulStreptococcusspp. andEscherichia coliin the ileum (Abu Hafsa and Ibrahim2017). Similarly, it was reported that chicks fed 0.72% grapeseed extract exhibited an increase inLactobacillussp. in their ileal contents (Viveros et al.2011). Adding grape seeds to the diet (up to 4%) has been found to reduce oxidative stress by boosting the activity of antioxidant enzymes in the plasma, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH‐Px) (Abu Hafsa and Ibrahim2017). At the same time, it lowers the levels of thiobarbituric acid‐reactive substances (Abu Hafsa and Ibrahim2017). Overall, the bioactive properties of GBs contribute to the maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity and disease prevention in poultry, notably promoting growth (Erinle and Adewole2022). For instance, feeding broilers with 2.5% GP increased the relative abundance of beneficial genera likeBacteroidesandLactobacilluswhile decreasing theFirmicutestoBacteroidetesratio in the cecum (Erinle et al.2022). Furthermore, they demonstrated that GBs increased the ratio of intestinal villus height to crypt depth (Erinle et al.2022). Recent studies have investigated the effects of diets supplemented with grape seed cake (GSC, 5% and 10% of dietary DM) on goat milk quality, blood metabolic profiles and antioxidant status in lactating goats (Antunović et al.2024). Goats receiving 10% GSC exhibited higher SOD and glutathione reductase activity, along with reduced glucose levels, somatic cell counts and β‐hydroxybutyrate concentrations. It was concluded that 10% GSC supplementation, rich in polyphenols, may alleviate lactation‐related stress, a notably challenging period for livestock (Antunović et al.2024). The remarkable nutritional profile of white GP (WGP) was emphasized, particularly its significant mineral content, with manganese levels at 106.35 mg/kg (Oancea et al.2024). Additionally, it has a high concentration of PUFAs at 65.05 g/100 g of fatty acid methyl esters, including a notable amount of omega‐3 fatty acids at 62.66 g/100 g of fatty acid methyl esters (Oancea et al.2024). The antioxidant compounds present in WGP included 12.49 mg/g of total polyphenols and 3.27 mg/kg of total flavonoids (Oancea et al.2024). The study also demonstrated the strong antioxidant potential of WGP, as shown by its results in the following assays: 2,2‐diphenyl‐1‐picrylhydrazyl radical‐scavenging activity, measuring 74.26 mM equivalent to Trolox; 2,2′‐azinobis(3‐ethylbenzothiazoline‐6‐sulfonic acid) radical scavenging activity at 75.07 mM equivalent to Trolox and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) at 286.26 mM equivalent to ascorbic acid (Oancea et al.2024). In another study, researchers examined the effects of adding 100 g/kg of DM from GP silage (GPS) and GP bran (GPB) as alternatives to traditional fibre sources in the diets of steers (Molosse et al.2024). They focused on carcass traits, meat quality and composition, as well as shelf life. The group receiving GPS exhibited a higher carcass pH compared to the control. Both the GPS and GPB groups demonstrated enhanced oxidative status, characterized by reduced lipid peroxidation and lower concentrations of reactive oxygen species in the meat compared to the control group. On the first day of storage, the activity of the antioxidant enzyme glutathioneS‐transferase was significantly greater in the meat from the GPS and GPB groups than in the control. Furthermore, the use of GPS was linked to lower bacterial levels in the meat, as evidenced by reduced total coliform counts and a tendency for decreased enterobacteria counts when compared to the control group (Molosse et al.2024). The dietary treatments also modified the fatty acid profile of the meat; specifically, the GPB diet resulted in an increased concentration ofn‐6 fatty acids, whereas the GPS diet showed a trend towards higher amounts of bothn‐6 andn‐9 fatty acids. Both diets (GPS and GPB) led to an increase in the concentrations of long‐chain fatty acids (Molosse et al.2024). Furthermore, the GPS diet resulted in lower levels of SFAs. Their research indicated that dietary interventions utilizing GPS and GPB could serve as promising alternatives for maintaining meat quality standards in real‐world retail situations (Molosse et al.2024). GP is an abundant source of various polyphenolic compounds, including tannins, proanthocyanidins, anthocyanidins, flavonoids and phenolic acids. The presence and diversity of these compounds are influenced by the conditions, efficiency and chemical reactions involved in the winemaking process (Li et al.2024). Studies have shown that many of these polyphenolic compounds do not have a negative effect on the growth performance and digestive metabolism of beef cattle (Voicu et al.2016). Investigations on the use of GBs in animal diets are presented in Table2. Condensed tannins (CTs) are particularly notable, accounting for 58.7% of the TPCs found in GP (Tayengwa et al.2020). In a study, the effects of different levels of GP (0%, 10% and 20% of DM from corn silage replaced with dried GP) were examined regarding their impact on growth performance, nitrogen utilization efficiency, antioxidant activity and the microbiota in the rumen and rectum of Angus bulls (Li et al.2024). The findings revealed that the ADG was higher in the GP0% and GP10% groups compared to the GP20% group, and urinary nitrogen levels decreased linearly with increasing GP addition. In terms of antioxidants, there were higher levels of catalase (CAT) in the GP10% group compared to the GP0% and GP20% groups, and TAC was significantly greater than that observed in the GP20% group. Additionally, an analysis of the microbial network diagram indicated enhanced microbial community complexity and stability in the GP10% group (Li et al.2024). In another study, the effects of dietary supplementation with dehydrated GP (DGP) at levels of 1% and 2% of dietary DM were evaluated concerning growth performance, nutrient digestibility, nitrogen balance, semen quality, fertility parameters and biochemical metabolic parameters in the blood plasma and seminal fluid of rabbit bucks (Derbali et al.2024). The 2% DGP supplementation led to improved growth performance and feed intake in the rabbits. However, it enhanced fat digestibility while reducing organic matter (OM) and CP digestibility without affecting nitrogen balance. Notably, 1% DGP improved both sperm mass motility and concentration. The study concluded that adding 1% DGP as a feed additive to the diets of rabbit bucks is an environmentally friendly approach that improves reproductive performance without negatively affecting growth (Derbali et al.2024). To evaluate the potential of grape stem‐based ingredients for rabbit nutrition, a study assessed its nutritional value, discovering a high fibre content (>40%) and polyphenol levels (>6%) alongside antioxidant and antimicrobial activity againstStaphylococcus aureus(San Martin et al.2024). Following this, a feed efficiency trial demonstrated that including up to 10% of grape stem ingredients did not adversely affect rabbit mortality, average daily feed intake, daily weight gain or feed conversion ratios (San Martin et al.2024). Similarly, the use of GP preserved as silage in the diets of growing–finishing swine was investigated (Giuliani et al.2024). They reported that the inclusion of GP did not change the proximal composition, cholesterol content, fatty acid profile, juiciness or flavour of the meat. Furthermore, GP improved pork quality characteristics such as increased tenderness, enhanced red colour intensity and delayed lipid oxidation, marking it as a sustainable alternative for utilizing waste products. Grape stems are another BP of winemaking, often discarded or minimally used as soil amendments (San Martin et al.2024). Nevertheless, they are rich in fibre and polyphenols, making them a promising feed source for livestock. In this context, rabbits are particularly well‐suited for such nutrition because their diets require high fibre levels to prevent digestive issues, whereas polyphenols can contribute to improved animal performance through their antimicrobial and antioxidant properties (San Martin et al.2024). Bioactive compounds found in GBs have the potential to combat foodborne pathogens, includingCampylobacter jejuni,E. coli,Listeria monocytogenes,Salmonella enterica,S. aureusandVibrio cholerae, as well as microbial toxins such as ochratoxin A and Shiga toxin. These compounds can enhance food microbiological safety, help prevent or treat illnesses in both humans and animals and optimize the utilization of grapes and their BPs (Friedman2014). In the aquafeed sector, BPs from the wine industry have been investigated as a means to improve feed quality. Their volatile components can enhance sensory attributes and beneficial characteristics, aligning with the principles of a circular economy. Specific compounds, such as hexanoic acid and terpenoids like limonene, may serve as antibacterial, antioxidant and antiproliferative agents. Additionally, esters and terpenoids contribute positively to the aroma of aquafeeds, imparting fruity, sweet, green, fresh and berry notes (Câmara et al.2020). A study examined the effects of a high‐fat diet (HFD) on lipotoxicity and disturbances in energy metabolism in rat hearts, specifically investigating the protective properties of grape seed extract (GSE) (Majoul et al.2023). This study highlighted the anti‐lipotoxic and cardioprotective effects of GSE, particularly concerning free fatty acid profiles and energy metabolism enzymes, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for cardiac dysfunction related to obesity. Furthermore, another study explored the therapeutic benefits of GP for treating different stages of non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease in mice (Daniel et al.2021). The findings indicated that GP reduced food intake, serum leptin levels and body weight gain, as well as mitigating ectopic fat deposition while preserving white adipose tissue mass (Daniel et al.2021). Additionally, GP improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, prevented adipose tissue inflammation and decreased hepatic steatosis. The researchers proposed that GP could serve as a beneficial supplement for the prevention and treatment of hepatic steatosis and obesity‐related disorders. In another study, it was reported that silage containing 144 g/kg of viniculture residues enhanced carcass conformation in lambs (Gonçalves et al.2024). Additionally, the inclusion of GSO positively influenced cow health, particularly enhancing oxidative stability by increasing total thiols, plasma ferric reducing capacity and overall antioxidant capacity (Signor et al.2024). This finding indicates that adding GSO might enhance the antioxidant defences in cows. A previous research indicated that the seed and pulp fractions of GP exhibit different characteristics, such as cell wall content (523 g/kg DM for seeds vs. 243 g/kg DM for pulp), CP content (104 g/kg DM for seeds vs. 138 g/kg DM for pulp), EE (99.0 g/kg DM for seeds vs. 31.7 g/kg DM for pulp), PUFAs levels (69.6% for seeds vs. 53.3% for pulp) and extractable polyphenols (55.0 g/kg DM for seeds vs. 32.1 g/kg DM for pulp) (Guerra‐Rivas et al.2016). Additionally, a recent study showed that diets supplemented with grapeseed procyanidins, a type of phenolic compound, improved resilience to weaning stress (Fang et al.2020). This was evidenced by the increased expression of antioxidant‐related genes like GSH‐Px, SOD and CAT in the liver, as well as lower levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the serum, liver and muscle tissues (Fang et al.2020). Another study indicated that GP and grape seed meal can be added to cattle diets at levels of up to 20% of DM without significantly impacting ruminal fermentation (Khiaosa‐Ard et al.2023). Furthermore, the study emphasized that grape phenols may have a positive effect on nitrogen metabolism in the rumen, leading to a reduction in ammonia production. Therefore, grape and winery BPs are recommended to be combined with feed ingredients that are high in highly digestible protein (Khiaosa‐Ard et al.2023). Moreover, it was suggested that using lactic acid bacteria inoculum and zeolite supplementation can improve the quality of GPS for future use in animal feed (Sokač Cvetnić et al.2023). Overall, similar to other agricultural BPs, grape‐derived materials are abundant in compounds with antioxidant properties beyond the widely recognized resveratrol. These compounds can act as effective scavengers of reactive free radicals or enzyme activators and possess antibacterial, anti‐inflammatory and anticancer properties, among various other health benefits. Moreover, the utilization of grape biomass is gaining traction as a source of dietary fibre and pigments. GBs can be included in the diets of monogastric animals to reduce feeding costs associated with conventional crops like maize and soybean meal, while also enhancing meat quality (Alfaia et al.2022). Additionally, GBs offer numerous industrial applications, particularly in animal feed, due to their high polyphenol content, which can positively influence intestinal microbiota and morphology and enhance anti‐inflammatory and antioxidant capabilities, thereby promoting intestinal health and production in pigs (Proca et al.2024).

Ensiling enhances the fermentation process by encouraging beneficial microbial activity, which leads to improved nutrient preservation and overall feed quality for livestock. In this regard, a study showed that ensiling GP, particularly with the addition ofLactiplantibacillus plantarum, enhances in vitro digestion efficiency by improving nutrient degradation and reducing inhibitory polyphenolic compounds (De Bellis et al.2022).

Nuts, including pistachios (Pistachia veraL.), have long been valued for their nutritional and functional properties. Pistachios are commonly grown and highly valued for their distinctive taste and unique composition. These characteristics make them ideal for use as food ingredients and for oil production (Özdikicierler and Öztürk‐Kerimoğlu2023). Conventional oil extraction techniques, especially solvent extraction, often necessitate refining processes that can diminish bioactive compounds. As a result, supercritical fluid extraction provides a superior option for maintaining nutritional quality. Notable BPs from pistachio oil production include flour, hulls and extracts, which are rich in terpenoids, phenolic compounds, lipids, amino acids and carbohydrates (Özdikicierler and Öztürk‐Kerimoğlu2023). Additionally, ground pistachio shells (PSs) can serve as dye adsorbents in water treatment (Özdikicierler and Öztürk‐Kerimoğlu2023). On the other hand, every year, a significant quantity of PBs accumulates in processing facilities, often discarded in the vicinity of pistachio orchards (Kazemi et al.2024). Photos of PBs and its derivatives are illustrated in Figure3. In this figure, the various parts of the pistachio, including the leaves, cluster, hard shell, soft shell and broken kernels, are presented. Each of these components can be incorporated as BPs in animal feed. These BPs typically remain moist, despite their rich nutrient content, creating an ideal environment for microbial growth. This situation can lead to environmental issues and an increase in fungal contaminants around pistachio orchards (Kazemi et al.2024). During pistachio processing, two BPs are generated: pistachio green hulls (PGH) and PS, which are removed during de‐hulling and shelling, comprising over 75% of the harvested crop. PGH is particularly rich in bioactive compounds, notably phenolics, but is often discarded as waste, creating environmental concerns (Ripari Garrido et al.2024). Studies have demonstrated its significant antioxidant, antimicrobial and antimutagenic properties. Pistachio nuts primarily consist of lipids (47.5%–57%), followed by protein (17.1%–27.1%), with dietary fibre ranging from 8.6% to 15.3%. Of this dietary fibre, about 97% is insoluble (Ripari Garrido et al.2024). The kernels have a low moisture content (3.3%–5.34%) and an ash content of approximately 3%. Triglycerides dominate the lipid fraction, with oleic, linoleic and α‐linolenic acids as the main UFAs. Potassium is the primary mineral, particularly abundant in Iranian pistachios (1589 mg/100 g), whereas sodium content is notably low (between 8.72 and 26.4 mg/100 g). Pistachios also contain lipophilic vitamins (A and E) and water‐soluble vitamins, including vitamin C and several B vitamins such as pyridoxine (B6), thiamine (B1) and riboflavin (Ripari Garrido et al.2024). Research indicates that PB contains a substantial amount of NFC (36.9%–40.4%), moderate levels of CP (11.4%–13.0%) and NDF (30.9%–33.3%), along with being abundant in polyphenolic and tannin compounds (Hosseini Ghaffari et al.2013a, 2013b; Shakeri et al.2014). Due to its cost‐effectiveness and availability, PB serves as a preferred source of energy and protein for ruminants (Shakeri2016). Recently, different amounts of pistachio waste (PW) have been added to the diets of sheep (Ebadi and Mahdavi2023; Hajalizadeh and Dayani2021), dairy cows (Mokhtarpour et al.2012), growing calves (Shakeri et al.2014), broiler chickens (Ahmadi Kohanali et al.2022) and Saanen dairy goats (Hosseini Ghaffari et al.2013a, 2013b; Kordi et al.2022). However, the use of PW for its phenolic and tannin content in ruminant diets is limited (Bohluli et al.2007). The TPCs in dried PB have been reported to vary between 7.5% and 14.2%, depending on the variety and growth stage (Bohluli et al.2007; Bagheripour et al.2008). Tannins, which are complex polyphenolic compounds, can have either beneficial or harmful effects on ruminants, depending on factors such as consumption method, chemical structure, molecular weight or the physiology of the consuming animals (Hagerman and Butler1991).

High concentrations of tannins (>50 g/kg DM) in lamb diets can reduce DMI due to their astringent properties and lower nutrient digestibility (Lima Júnior et al.2010; Mazza et al.2020). Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a synthetic, high molecular weight polymer that is poorly digested and absorbed in animal intestines (Grosell and Genz2006). It is widely utilized as a raw material in the food and pharmaceutical sectors (He et al.2019). Due to its strong affinity for tannins, PEG can form a complex with tannins (Makkar et al.1995). Aluminosilicate (AS), a porous clay composed of aluminium oxide and silicon dioxide, has a high specific surface area that can absorb various cations, including ammonium, and is used in treatments for numerous gastrointestinal issues (Herremans et al.2018). Several methods have been used to reduce the negative effects of phenolic and tannin compounds in ruminant diets, including electron irradiation (Fatehi et al.2020), gamma irradiation (Valizadeh et al.2019), ensiling (SoltaniNezhad et al.2016; Hajalizadeh and Dayani2021) and the use of materials like PEG (Kordi et al.2022). Additionally, several management strategies have been suggested to alleviate the impact of tannins, including drying, crushing, chemical treatments and the use of binding agents such as PEG and polyvinyl pyrrolidine (Bagheripour et al.2008). It has been observed that bentonite clay can act as an effective inactivating agent because it is less expensive than PEG and has the capability to absorb or bind anti‐nutritional factors, such as tannins, in animal feed (Kemboi et al.2023). Recently, a study was conducted on PWs to examine their chemical and mineral compositions, along with the nutritional impacts of incorporating AS and PEG into PW‐based diets (Kazemi et al.2024). In the first experiment, the chemical compositions and ruminal fermentation activities of PW and its derivatives were determined. In the second experiment, 40 male Mahabadi goats were divided into 4 groups: a control group, a group with 40% PW, a group with PW plus 10 g of PEG and a group with PW plus 10 g of AS. The results indicated that adding PW to the diet reduced DMI, final body weight and growth performance; however, the addition of PEG or AS significantly improved digestibility and ruminal fermentation activities, enhancing growth performance. It is recommended to include PW at a level of 40% in the diets of fattening goats, supplemented with AS or PEG for optimal nutritional benefits (Kazemi et al.2024). In another study, the effects of pistachio hull (PH), a tannin‐rich BP, on nitrogen metabolism, milk production and digestibility in lactating dairy cows were examined (Sadeghi et al.2024). They utilized a 4 × 4 Latin square design involving 12 Holstein cows to evaluate diets that included either soybean meal or slow‐release urea (SRU) in combination with PH. Their results showed that feeding diets with 7.65% PH reduced milk yield, milk urea nitrogen and milk efficiency, while increasing milk fat and protein concentration. The inclusion of PH led to a reduction in the digestibility of DM, CP and NDF. Although there was no significant impact on nitrogen intake and urine or milk excretion, PH increased faecal nitrogen excretion and reduced apparent nitrogen efficiency (Sadeghi et al.2024). They demonstrated that replacing sugar beet pulp with PH negatively impacted nutrient digestion and milk production efficiency. In contrast, the use of SRU was shown to be a viable nitrogen source that did not affect lactation productivity (Sadeghi et al.2024). Investigations on the use of PBs in animal diets are presented in Table3. The study examined how incorporating 6% pistachio skin into the diets of grower and finisher rabbits affects the quality of their meat (Attard, Liotta, et al.2024). In the study, 150 Martini rabbits were divided into two groups: One group received a diet containing pistachio skins, whereas the other did not. The findings indicated no negative impact on growth or carcass characteristics. However, the treated group showed an enhanced fatty acid profile, characterized by higher levels of monounsaturated and PUFAs, whereas SFAs were reduced. This suggests that pistachio skin could potentially enhance the nutritional value of rabbit meat (Attard, Liotta, et al.2024). Furthermore, another study compared the nutritional value of PS powder to soybean hulls in pig diets (Kim et al.2024). In two experiments involving gestating and lactating sows, they measured the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM, gross energy (GE) and total dietary fibre (TDF), as well as digestible energy (DE). Their results showed that PS powder had significantly lower ATTD of DM, GE and TDF, as well as lower DE, compared to soybean hulls (Kim et al.2024). Consequently, the study suggests that the inclusion of PS powder in lactation diets should be limited due to its lower energy content (Kim et al.2024). One of the primary BPs of pistachio processing is the green hull, which makes up over 60% of the total PBs (Arjeh et al.2020). The PGH is rich in bioactive compounds, particularly phenolics (Rafiee et al.2018). A study reported the composition of PGH as follows: DM 23.0%, 11.0%, crude fibre 15.0%, ash 12.0%, crude fat 6.0% and nitrogen‐free extract 55.50% (Shakerardekani and Molaei2020). Another study investigated the effects of PGHs aqueous extract (PHE) on Ross 308 broiler chicks that were challenged withEimeria(Noruzi et al.2024). They found that increasing PHE levels improved growth performance, antioxidant capacity, and reduced excreta oocyte counts and lesion scores in challenged broilers. PHE also mitigated the negative effects ofEimeriaon antioxidant levels, leading to an increase in TAC and enzyme activity. Overall, they noted that PHE enhanced performance and health without causing any adverse effects on intestinal morphology (Noruzi et al.2024). Furthermore, another study examined the effects of aerobic exercise and pistachio soft hull extract (PSHE) on inflammatory gene expression in the soleus muscles of rats that were fed an HFD (Barshan et al.2024). The study found that the HFD led to a significant decrease in IL‐6 and an increase in IL‐1β expression. Both aerobic exercise and PSHE, alone or in combination, significantly reduced IL‐1β levels and increased IL‐6 expression compared to the HFD control group. Overall, the findings suggest that aerobic exercise and PSHE can mitigate HFD‐induced inflammation in skeletal muscle (Barshan et al.2024).

Ensiling not only improves the stability of feed by minimizing spoilage factors but also enhances the overall nutritional profile, making it a valuable practice in animal nutrition management. Therefore, a study reported that ensiling PBs significantly reduces the levels of CTs, hydrolysable tannins and fibre, thereby decreasing in vitro gas production and OM digestibility (Bagheripour et al.2008).

Crocus sativusL. (CC), widely recognized as saffron, is a highly valued spice originating from Asia, particularly from Iran, which is the leading producer of this spice. Saffron, derived solely from dried stigmas, is recognized as the most expensive spice in the world (Marrone et al.2024). Iran and several countries in the Middle East experience arid and semi‐arid climates. Due to significant constraints on water resources in the region and predictions of future droughts, a shortfall in forage resources previously cultivated through irrigation is anticipated. CC is an autumn‐blooming plant primarily cultivated for its red flower stigmas that, upon drying, produce saffron, often referred to as ‘red gold’ due to its high value (Popović‐Djordjević et al.2021). With growing concerns about synthetic antioxidants in food, researchers are increasingly investigating the antioxidant properties of saffron's bioactive compounds, including crocin, crocetin, picrocrocin and safranal. These compounds exhibit significant antioxidant potential, demonstrated through various assays (Popović‐Djordjević et al.2021). Moreover, saffron processing waste and specific plant parts are emerging as valuable sources of bioactive compounds, highlighting the importance of waste valorization in the agri‐food sector and its role in reducing environmental pollution (Popović‐Djordjević et al.2021). Therefore, identifying and utilizing agricultural waste that can partially meet livestock feed requirements is vital. The use of these unconventional feed sources can not only reduce feed costs but also alleviate the environmental issues associated with their accumulation. Significantly, the primary and notable BPs identified in this region consist of the petals, stamens (anthers) and stem (perianth tube) of saffron. Additionally, saffron is a monocotyledonous plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. Botanically, it completes its life cycle within a year, but agronomically, it is regarded as a perennial plant (Fallahi and Mahmoodi2018). The presence of compounds such as crocin, picocrocin and safranal in saffron has made it a popular natural colouring and flavouring agent in various industrial and food products (Kaveh and Salari2018). The various parts of the saffron flower are illustrated in Figure4. In this figure, the various parts of the saffron plant, including the stigma, petals, stamen, perianth tube, bract, leaves, bracteole and cataphylls, are displayed. The stigma is the most valuable part of saffron, known for its numerous nutritional applications, particularly as a food seasoning, whereas the remaining parts have the potential for use in animal nutrition. Furthermore, investigations on the use of saffron BPs in animal diets are shown in Table4. Currently, Iran is the largest producer of saffron in the world. Specifically, the production of saffron in Iran reached approximately 336,000 kg in the year 2016, and in 2017, this figure rose by 12% to exceed 376,200 kg (Agricultural Statistics2017). The total saffron cultivation area in the country in 2017 was equivalent to 1,080,864 hectares, with Razavi Khorasan province holding the largest share of 84,226 hectares (Agricultural Statistics2017). The weight percentages of the components of fresh saffron flowers include 86.42% petals, 5.93% anthers (stamen) and 7.64% stigma (Hemmati Kakhki2001). In Iran, after the stigma is separated from the flower, it is dried and sent to the market; however, the remaining saffron flower BPs, including the petals, stamen and stem (perianth tube), are left as main BPs, amounting to approximately 194,445 t of sepals and petals and 13,753 t of anthers annually (Hemmati Kakhki2001). Occasionally, a small quantity of stigma, leaves, cataphylls, bract, perianth tube and bracteole may be present in this waste, potentially introduced during the harvesting of saffron flowers. Although these residues contain significant amounts of valuable compounds, they are currently disposed of in the environment without utilization. Feeding livestock with these residues can prevent the wastage of these valuable BPs. Saffron petals (SPs) present a relatively suitable potential for livestock nutrition, with a reported CP concentration of 11.55% on a DM basis, and the rapid degradation component of the DM of SP being reported as 65.94% (Alipour et al.2016). In another study, the concentrations of sodium, potassium, calcium, copper, iron, manganese, zinc and phosphorus found in SP were reported to be 25.75, 542.13, 486.25, 0.87, 17.99, 2.93, 1.80 and 209.90 mg/100 g of DM, respectively (Khoshbakht Fahim et al.2012). A further study on saffron residues revealed that these residues provide appropriate nutritional value for livestock, especially in the late stages of vegetative growth, with effective degradability, CP, NDF, water‐soluble carbohydrates and calcium percentages reported as 69.6%, 13.9%, 32.5%, 27.2% and 1.3%, respectively (Kardan Moghadam et al.2014). A moisture content of 91.33% has been reported for SP (Alipour et al.2016). The concentrations of ash, CP, fat and total carbohydrates in SP were reported as follows: 7.08% ash, 6.35% CP, 3% fat and 71.16% total carbohydrates (Jadouali et al.2018). One of the key strategies for reducing wastewater production in silos is the use of moisture‐absorbing materials, which retain nutrients within the silo by absorbing the produced leachate (Seidali Dolat‐Abad et al.2016). In a study, wheat bran (WB) was used as a moisture‐absorbing substance for silage of high moisture citrus pulps (Kordi and Naserian2012). Saffron has diverse applications across the food, beverage, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Like other phytochemicals, saffron and its BPs are considered important sources of bioactive natural compounds. The health benefits of saffron are well‐established, particularly its antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory properties, which help reduce pro‐inflammatory cytokines and are acknowledged in internal medicine (Marrone et al.2024). Specifically, saffron's health benefits are linked to its ability to combat degenerative maculopathy, depression, anxiety, neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic syndrome, cancer and chronic kidney disease, while also enhancing glucose metabolism. A review emphasizes key studies that showcase saffron's potential as a valuable ally in the prevention and treatment of various conditions. Additionally, it advocates for the use of saffron BPs within a bio‐circular economy framework, which aims to minimize waste, optimize resource utilization and promote environmental and economic sustainability (Marrone et al.2024). In a study, the researchers assessed the chemical composition, silage characteristics, digestibility and in vitro gas production parameters of saffron waste (SW), specifically petals and stamens, both prior to and following the ensiling process (Kazemi et al.2020). The experimental design comprised seven treatments, each with four replicates: (1) SW before ensiling (SWBE); (2) SW after ensiling (SWAE); (3) a mixture of 96.88% SWAE and 3.12% WB based on fresh weight; (4) a mixture of 93.75% SWAE and 6.25% WB (fresh weight); (5) a mixture of 87.5% SWAE and 12.5% WB (fresh weight); (6) a mixture of 75% SWAE and 25% WB (fresh weight) and (7) a mixture of 50% SWAE and 50% WB (fresh weight). The second treatment exhibited poor quality and an undesirable odour as a result of significant mould growth and adhesion. However, the addition of WB, especially in larger amounts (as seen in treatments 4, 5 and 6), significantly improved the quality of the silage (Kazemi et al.2020). The chemical composition of the treatments varied, with DM ranging from 10.40% to 54.37% (fresh weight), NDF from 12.83% to 27.35%, ADF from 7.23% to 11.45%, CP from 14.88% to 15.67%, EE from 5.43% to 5.77% and ash content from 5.89% to 11.12% (dry weight) (Kazemi et al.2020). Notably, the highest concentrations of NDF and ADF (27.35% and 11.45%, respectively) were recorded in treatment 7 (Kazemi et al.2020). Furthermore, treatment 7 also exhibited the lowest pH values, along with the highest levels of lactic and acetic acids, gas production after 12 and 24 h of incubation and a consistent gas production rate. True DM digestibility varied between treatments, with values ranging from 76.30% for treatment 2 to 79.95% for treatment 1 (Kazemi et al.2020). Overall, the study concluded that SW possesses good nutritional value prior to ensiling, whereas ensiling without additives diminishes its quality. Additionally, the authors indicated that ensiling SW with WB as a moisture‐absorbing agent did not adversely affect certain nutritional parameters (Kazemi et al.2020). They further observed that treatment 7 demonstrated the most favourable conditions in terms of appearance, odour, absence of mould and fermentation characteristics within the silo environment (Kazemi et al.2020). Recent pharmacological research suggests that saffron extract exhibits a range of beneficial effects, including antitumor, anticonvulsant, antidepressant, anti‐inflammatory, anti‐lipid, anti‐instigative, antihyperlipidemic and antioxidant properties (Asdaq and Inamdar2009; Melnyk et al.2010; Goli et al.2012). It has been proposed that certain BPs derived from Moroccan saffron could be used as feed supplements for ruminants throughout both the wet and dry seasons (Jadouali et al.2021). When used as a feed additive, saffron has the potential to serve as a natural colourant and enhance antioxidant activity. Studies suggest that it may improve the oxidative stability of poultry meat and eggs (Botsoglou et al.2010). Additionally, evidence has been reported regarding the chemopreventive and protective effects of saffron extract against oxidative stress induced by genotoxic agents in animal models (Asdaq and Inamdar2009). Further investigations have highlighted the pharmacological benefits of SW in treating certain gastrointestinal diseases, which are attributed to its content of phenolic compounds and phytosterols (Ashktorab et al.2019; Rezaee Khorasany and Hosseinzadeh2016).

Research on SWs as a dietary supplement for small ruminants is limited. Therefore, two experiments were conducted to evaluate the nutritional potential of SW (Kazemi2024). The first trial included a proximate analysis of SW from various regions of northeast Iran, revealing variability in its chemical and mineral composition. The second trial evaluated the incorporation of a 1:1 mixture of SW at two levels (30 and 60 g/day) in the diets of Afshari male lambs. Although DMI and nutrient digestibility remained unaffected, certain health indicators, including MDA, TAC and cholesterol levels, showed significant changes in lambs fed 60 g SW/day. This finding highlights the need for further long‐term investigations to evaluate the in vivo effects of SW (Kazemi2024). A study examined the impact of SP supplementation on the lactation performance, nutrient digestibility and antioxidant status of dairy goats (Ebrahimi et al.2024). Eighteen multiparous Saanen goats were assigned to three groups receiving diets with 0%, 1.5% and 3% SP. Results indicated that although DMI and nutrient digestibility remained constant, the 3% SP group experienced a significant increase in milk production and protein content. Additionally, plasma glucose and cholesterol levels decreased, whereas TAC improved in both plasma and milk. The study concluded that up to 3% SP supplementation positively affects milk yield and antioxidant status without harming nutrient digestibility (Ebrahimi et al.2024). A study investigated the effects of different extraction methods on the antioxidant activity of CC and their performance in vegetable oils (Najafi et al.2022). Saffron stigmas were extracted using various solvents and methods, revealing that the methanol/water (50:50) extract, obtained through a combination of ultrasonic‐assisted and microwave‐assisted extraction, exhibited the highest TPCs (31.56 mg/g GAE) and antioxidant activity (83.24% inhibition). The freeze‐dried saffron extract, containing key bioactive compounds, significantly enhanced the oxidative stability of canola, sunflower and corn oils when added at 1000 ppm (Najafi et al.2022). Furthermore, the extraction efficiency of bioactive compounds from saffron anthers was investigated using various solvents, including ethanol, methanol and distilled water (Mahood et al.2023). Ethanol was found to be the most effective solvent, yielding the highest TPCs, total flavonoid content (TFC) and antioxidant activity, with flavonoids showing superior antioxidant properties compared to ascorbic acid. Notably, key compounds identified included gallic acid, syringic acid, vanillic acid and various flavonoids. This research highlights that saffron anthers, typically regarded as agricultural waste, are a valuable source of bioactive compounds, offering potential economic benefits through the valorization of saffron BPs in the Mashhad region of Iran (Mahood et al.2023). In another research study, the nutritive value of saffron residues was evaluated by determining their chemical composition, in situ degradability and in vitro gas production using two permanently fistulated Holstein heifers (Kardan Moghaddam et al.2015). The analysis indicated that the composition of saffron forage consists of 96.8% OM, 6.7% CP, along with noteworthy amounts of both fibre and NFC. However, essential minerals such as sodium, magnesium, zinc and iron were found to be insufficient for ruminant requirements. The study indicated that the rapidly and slowly degradable fractions were 32% and 39.2%, respectively, whereas the OM digestibility was 53.9%. The research concluded that saffron forage could serve as an economical feedstuff alternative within animal diets (Kardan Moghaddam et al.2015).

Raisins are the ripe, dried fruit of grapes, marketed under various names depending on the type of grape, the drying method and conditions and permissible additives. Like other dried fruits, raisins are available throughout the year. To produce raisins, grapes with white flesh and green skins are used; after drying, their colour changes and darkens, ultimately turning into a sweet snack with small seeds. Raisins are rich in iron, potassium, calcium and B vitamins, and they possess antioxidant properties that help prevent cellular damage (Schuster et al.2017; Thiruchelvi et al.2020). They contain a significant amount of fibre, antioxidants and energy. The fibre in raisins can help prevent colon cancer and abnormal cell growth, as well as aid in the control of blood sugar levels, making them beneficial for treating stomach issues and constipation. Eating raisins helps combat fatigue and lethargy while also strengthening the body (Schuster et al.2017; Thiruchelvi et al.2020). The bioflavonoids found in raisins contribute to detoxification and purification of the blood and the body, supporting liver health and the treatment of liver diseases. Nutritionists believe that eating a few raisins daily can enhance memory and may protect individuals from Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, the high fibre content in raisins aids in reducing cholesterol levels and improving intestinal function. Potassium, which is abundantly present in raisins, helps to lower blood pressure and prevent fluid retention in the body (Schuster et al.2017; Thiruchelvi et al.2020). The high calcium content in raisins supports bone health and helps prevent osteoporosis. Moreover, raisins contain selenium, which contributes to skin clarity and nourishment. The Iranian grape, scientifically classified under the family Vitaceae and the speciesV. vinifera(commonly referred to as European grape), has seen an increase in the establishment of agricultural processing factories in recent years. A schematic of raisin preparation and its BPs are shown in Figure5. This figure outlines several different methods for producing raisins. Generally, during the production of raisins, the grapes undergo an initial washing and the removal of unhealthy or damaged fruits before being dried without the addition of chemicals, either in the shade or under sunlight. Grapes dried in the shade are referred to as ‘sun‐dried raisins’, whereas those dried in direct sunlight are called ‘shade‐dried raisins’. In some instances, after thoroughly washing the grape clusters, they are briefly immersed in a special oil and then dried in designated areas using metal wire rods, away from sunlight and in the shade. Another method of raisin production involves washing the grape clusters and discarding unsuitable fruits, then drying them in the shade followed by sulphur fumigation. This last process typically results in golden‐coloured raisins, which are commonly known as ‘smoked raisins’ in Kashmar, a city in the Razavi Khorasan province. Although there may be various other methods worldwide for producing raisins, Figure5highlights the most important ones. It is noteworthy that during the preparation of raisins for human consumption, waste products such as rejected raisins (those that are broken and not suitable for human consumption), tails and stalks are generated during the processing of raisins and at cleaning factories, which can have nutritional potential for livestock. These facilities often produce a significant amount of agricultural waste, including BPs from raisin production. Notably, the processing of raisins generates approximately 900 t of pomace and tails, alongside 135 t of sugared raisin and 463 t of other waste annually. On the other hand, RBs comprise the skins and stems of grapes, as well as unripe berries along with their stems, leaves and rachises generated during the production of raisins (Ahmadi Kohanali et al.2022). Unfortunately, these BPs are often incinerated despite their potential utility in the food industry and are typically disposed of in the surrounding environment without proper treatment (Yari et al.2016). The use of RBs, especially in animal feed, presents a promising opportunity to reduce environmental pollution while addressing certain nutritional needs in livestock. However, it is crucial to note that these BPs might also contain anti‐nutritional factors like tannins and lignin (Alipour and Rouzbehan2007; Besharati and Taghizadeh2009; Yari et al.2016). High levels of tannin in the diet can negatively impact livestock health by binding to proteins, minerals and carbohydrates, which may impair microbial activity and disrupt digestion in both the rumen and intestines (McSweeney et al.2001; Besharati and Taghizadeh2009). However, tannins can also affect protein metabolism in ruminants by reducing the ruminal degradation of dietary protein. This may lead to more protein reaching the intestines, potentially increasing the concentration of VFAs and providing beneficial effects (Besharati and Taghizadeh2009; McSweeney et al.2001; Yari et al.2016). Adding tannin‐rich materials into animal diets has been proposed as a strategy to reduce protein degradability in the rumen (McSweeney et al.2001). Additionally, it is important to note that some RBs contain high levels of insoluble carbohydrates, mainly made up of simple sugars (Yari et al.2016). A study investigated the use of RBs as a substitute for barley grain in diets that included cereal straw for growing ram lambs (Ahmadi et al.2022). Three iso‐nitrogenous and iso‐energetic diets with RBs replacing 9% and 18% of barley were tested on 12 lambs using a 3 × 3 Latin square design. The nutritional composition of RBs showed 78.4% DM, 3.7% CP and significant fibre content. The results indicated that substituting ground barley with RBs did not affect final body weight, ADG, feed intake or nutrient digestibility. However, blood urea levels decreased, whereas blood total protein and triglycerides increased at the 9% substitution level.

The findings suggest that up to 18% of barley can be replaced with RBs in lamb diets without negatively impacting growth performance or health metrics (Ahmadi et al.2022). Furthermore, another study examined the sustainable potential of biomass produced during the grape drying process, analysing 11 different RBs for their organic content and energy properties (Okasha et al.2023). Key findings included significant variations in carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen levels among RBs. BPs no. 10 and no. 11 exhibited the highest calorific values of 22.73 ± 0.08 and 22.80 ± 0.07 MJ/kg, whereas BPs no. 5%–9% had minimal lignin content. The maximum biogas production was observed in BP groups C (11.50 NL/L) and B (11.20 NL/L). The research concludes that biomass from various raisin production stages shows promise as a solid fuel and energy source, particularly suitable for pyrolysis (Okasha et al.2023). Some researchers investigated the nutritive value of several RBs for ruminants in semi‐arid conditions, employing the National Research Council feeding system and in vitro gas production methods (Yari et al.2015b). The study identified three types of RBs: outer layers of flesh and skin (RBs1), rejected raisins (RBs2) and peduncles with branches (RBs3) (Yari et al.2015b). Results showed that RBs1 and RBs2 had significantly higher predicted ME and net energy for lactation compared to RBs3. Additionally, RBs2 exhibited superior in vitro gas production, energy estimates and OM digestibility. The findings suggest that RBs can serve as alternative feeds for ruminants during dry periods (Yari et al.2015b). Similarly, in another study, the nutritional value of several RBs for ruminants was evaluated, with the aim of addressing feed shortages during dry periods (Yari et al.2015a). The RBs assessed include different parts of the grapevine (flesh and skin; rejected raisins and branches). Results indicate that RBs1 had the lowest NDF and lignin content, whereas RBs3 had the highest. RBs1 and RBs3 also exhibited higher total tannin concentrations compared to RBs2. In situ ruminal degradation analysis showed that RBs1 had better degradability and lower undegradable fractions than RBs3, with RBs2 being intermediate. The findings suggest that RBs can serve as alternative ruminant feed during dry periods, although their tannin and lignin levels must be carefully considered. Additionally, the nutritional value of RBs as feed for ruminants was investigated, particularly in semi‐arid climates like Malayer in Hamedan province (Yari et al.2016). The objective is to compare this BP with late‐flowering alfalfa hay and evaluate its impact on the in vitro fermentation of alfalfa. RBs revealed significantly higher total phenol, tannin and OM content compared to alfalfa hay, while demonstrating lower values for DM, CP and NDF (Yari et al.2016). The in situ results indicated that RBs had higher degradability for DM and OM but lower degradability for NDF and CP. The study also found that increasing levels of RBs improved the rate of gas production and nutrient supply, largely due to its higher NFC content and the presence of tannins, which appeared to influence fermentation dynamics (Yari et al.2016). The researchers concluded that the RBs can be considered a viable feed option for ruminants, enhancing the in vitro gas production kinetics of alfalfa hay and overall nutrient efficiency (Yari et al.2016). The effects of varying inclusion levels of RB in the diets of growing lambs were studied, involving 24 male lambs aged 6 months (Saremi et al.2014). Four inclusion levels were tested: R0 (0 g), R1 (100 g), R2 (200 g) and R3 (300 g) RB/kg of DM. The study assessed animal performance, ruminal parameters and protozoa populations. Results indicated that R2 and R3 diets led to the highest final body weights. However, R3 exhibited the lowest DMI and feed conversion rate. Although total protozoa numbers increased with RB inclusion,Epidiniumspp. disappeared in the R3 diet. Dietary inclusion of RBs above 200 g/kg DM significantly decreased digestibility of CP and NDF. The study concludes that RBs can be included in growing lamb diets up to 200 g/kg DM without adversely affecting production performance (Saremi et al.2014). In another study, an experiment was conducted to evaluate the impact of PEG (PEG‐6000) and urea on in vitro DM and OM digestibility (IVDMD and IVOMD) and gas production in vitro, using raisin stalks (Angaji et al.2011). The raisin stalks contained 8.6% CP and significant levels of total extractable phenol and tannin. Treatments included control (no supplementation), 3% urea, 5% urea and a combination of 3% urea with 5% PEG. Results showed that PEG significantly enhanced IVOMD and IVDMD and increased gas production during incubation compared to other treatments. The study concluded that PEG treatment can mitigate the negative effects of tannins on digestibility and gas production in raisin stalks (Angaji et al.2011). Because in raisin production factories, raisin processing waste is viewed as a low‐value BP, less attention may be paid to maintaining its quality, and due to storage for a relatively long time, anti‐nutritional substances such as mould may be observed in it. In general, it should be noted that raisin waste may contain anti‐nutritional substances such as tannins and lignin. Feeding high levels of tannins can negatively affect animal performance due to the binding of tannins with proteins. However, the presence of a certain amount of tannin in the diet can have beneficial effects on protein metabolism and animal performance by reducing protein degradation in the rumen and increasing the amount of protein that passes to the intestine.

Olive pomace (OP), also known as oil cake, is a BP generated during the oil extraction process. It comprises the skins, pulp and pits of olives, along with a residual quantity of fat, and can represent up to 80% of the total processed fruit (Monteiro et al.2024). This BP is rich in bioactive compounds, making comprehensive characterization essential to explore its potential in functional foods, nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals for both humans and animals (Monteiro et al.2024). A schematic of the olive and its BPs is illustrated in Figure6. This figure illustrates the BPs generated from olives, which mainly include pits or kernels and pulp that are no longer suitable for human consumption. These BPs can be easily converted into animal feed through various processing methods. In vitro studies indicate that biophenols from OP exhibit antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory and antiproliferative properties, which may help mitigate cardiovascular disorders and improve animal immunity and meat quality. Although human clinical trials are limited and show minimal biological changes, some biomarkers suggest potential cardioprotective effects (Monteiro et al.2024).



A schematic of olive and its by‐products.

In industrialized societies, waste from olive production poses a significant challenge, as international statistics indicate that approximately 5%–10% of agricultural production is discarded as waste. This waste has the potential to serve as a food source for a significant population. OP enhances the flavour of meat in livestock and poultry and provides advantages over traditional feeds in animal husbandry. However, it also presents certain drawbacks. Notably, the high moisture and oil content in OP can lead to mould formation when exposed to air, rendering it unfit for consumption as feed. To prevent mould growth, OP is pressed to remove its moisture and oil and subsequently dried at high temperatures to produce olive meal for animal feed. This process increases the shelf life of olive meal, resulting in a healthier feed option for livestock and poultry. In Iran, approximately 50,000 t of OP are produced annually in oil extraction facilities, with about 50% of this material composed of water. From this total, around 20,000 t of usable waste are obtained, which can be utilized as animal feed. OP contains adequate amounts of oil and can be considered an energy‐generating food source. Its use in feeding livestock, poultry and aquatic animals leads to the reduction of environmental pollution and ration cost, but the amount of consumption of each food item in the ration is important. It is another important thing that should be paid enough attention to, and it is possible that the consumption of an edible substance in a certain amount in the diet has beneficial effects on the growth and breeding of fish, but at higher levels, it is not only not fruitful but also causes a decrease in growth and adverse effects. One of the most important limitations of using OP is the variability of its chemical composition and the presence of large amounts of anti‐nutritional compounds such as tannins, which in combination with dietary protein and carbohydrates reduce the activity of digestive enzymes. OP is a valuable source of oil and can serve as an energy‐rich feed ingredient. Its incorporation into the diets of livestock, poultry and aquatic animals can help reduce environmental pollution and lower feed costs. However, the quantity of each feed component in the diet is crucial. It is essential to recognize that although moderate consumption of OP can positively influence the growth and reproduction of fish, excessive amounts may lead to detrimental effects, including reduced growth rates. A significant challenge in utilizing OP is the variability in its chemical composition, as well as the presence of substantial levels of anti‐nutritional compounds, such as tannins. These compounds can interact with dietary proteins and carbohydrates, inhibiting the activity of digestive enzymes. In the Mediterranean region, olive oil production generates bio‐waste such as olive oil pomace and olive tree leaves, which can be utilized in animal diets (Scicutella et al.2024). Investigations on the use of olive BPs in animal diets are presented in Table5. Two in vitro trials examined the effects of these co‐products on rumen fermentation and microbiome ecology, using isoproteic and isoenergetic diets (Scicutella et al.2024). Results indicated that both olive oil pomace and olive tree leaves increased the levels of beneficial fatty acids (C18:1 c9 and C18:3 c9c12c15) while selectively altering microbial communities, reducing the abundance of certain genera likeButyrivibrioandPseudobutyrivibrioand increasing others such asChristensenellaceae_R‐7_groupandManheimia. This study demonstrates the potential of these BPs to effectively modulate rumen microbial communities (Scicutella et al.2024). Furthermore, in another study, the effects of adding olive cake (OC) into the diets of indigenous Bísaro pigs were evaluated, focusing on the quality of processed meat products (Leite et al.2024). Loins and ‘cachaços’ were produced using a standardized process, revealing significant differences in physicochemical properties such as water activity, moisture, total fat, protein and haem pigments (Leite et al.2024). The diet also significantly influenced NaCl content. However, the diet did not affect the proportions of saturated, monounsaturated or PUFAs, although a significant increase inn‐3 fatty acids was noted. The diet with 25% centrifuged OC yielded the highest levels ofn‐3 fatty acids, resulting in a lower PUFAsn‐6/n‐3 ratio compared to the control (Leite et al.2024). OC constitutes approximately 35% of the weight of olives processed and serves as a solid BP of olive oil extraction (Difonzo et al.2022; Amato et al.2024). Given its significant environmental impact, there has been a surge of research in recent years focusing on sustainable applications for this BP. This includes energy production, the development of new materials, pharmaceutical uses, food products and animal feeds (Espeso et al.2021; Amato et al.2024). In particular, the addition of OC into animal feed presents a noteworthy alternative to conventional feed for both monogastric animals (Leite et al.2024) and ruminants (Abbeddou et al.2014; Hafez et al.2024), owing to its high content of water‐soluble polyphenols (such as hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol) and UFAs, particularly oleic acid (C18:1cis‐9). Among the various methods for olive oil extraction, the two‐phase milling process is noted for its ability to yield a greater quantity of polyphenols (Scicutella et al.2023). Numerous studies have identified feeding strategies that can enhance the fatty acid composition of milk, which is linked to beneficial metabolic effects in humans (Amato et al.2024) and serves as an important indicator of the metabolic and energy status of cows (Giannuzzi et al.2022; Amato et al.2024). Reports indicate that cows fed diets supplemented with OC exhibit increased levels of MUFAs in their milk, a reduction of SFAs and lower thrombogenic and atherogenic indices (Castellani et al.2017). These findings are supported by additional studies (Chiofalo et al.2020; Neofytou et al.2023), which have demonstrated that the inclusion of OC, whether ensiled or dried, in ruminant diets can serve as an effective nutritional strategy to enhance the composition of dairy products while simultaneously reducing animal feeding costs. Researchers investigated the chemical composition, fatty acid profile and polyphenol content of Provola cheese produced from the milk of cows whose diets were supplemented with OC (Attard, Bionda, et al.2024). The study, conducted over several months, demonstrated that both the diet and seasonal variations significantly influenced the composition of the cheese. Notably, the cheese produced in spring from cows on the supplemented diet exhibited the most favourable health attributes, characterized by lower atherogenic and thrombogenic indices alongside a higher total polyphenol content. Specifically, cheese from the treated group had a 32.9% increase in polyphenol levels compared to the control group, enhancing its nutritional functionality. Overall, the inclusion of dried and stoned OC in dairy cow diets not only fosters sustainable production practices but also enhances the nutritional quality of the resulting cheese (Attard, Bionda, et al.2024). Moreover, another study evaluated the effects of substituting 20% of the TMR with milled olive cake (MOC), with or without the addition of PEG or fibrolytic enzymes, on the productive performance of Barki sheep (Bakr et al.2024). In the first experiment, five rations were compared, revealing that PEG had no significant impact, making the fourth group (20% MOC) the most effective (Bakr et al.2024). The second experiment involved 18 Barki lambs divided into three groups, where the ration containing 20% MOC resulted in decreased DM and OM digestibility, with significant differences in CP digestibility (Bakr et al.2024). Rumen pH and ammonia levels remained unchanged across groups. However, significant differences were noted in total gain, ADG and feed efficiency, with a slight increase in DMI in the group fed the ration with fibrolytic enzymes (R3) (Bakr et al.2024). It is reported that OP is rich in polyphenols, known for their health benefits, including anti‐inflammatory and antibacterial properties (Cavallucci et al.2024). The anti‐inflammatory effects of in vitro digested OP were examined as a potential functional ingredient in horse feed, suggesting that OP could serve as a valuable source of nutraceuticals while also mitigating the environmental impact of olive oil BPs (Cavallucci et al.2024). Although horses can utilize dietary fat effectively, the fat content in commercial feeds is often restricted (Cavallucci et al.2024). The impact of a solid‐state‐fermented mixture of olive mill stone waste (OMSW) andLathyrus clymenumhusks (LP) on the antioxidant blood parameters of weaned piglets was investigated in another study (Eliopoulos et al.2024). Two hundred piglets were divided into two groups, receiving either a control diet or a diet with 50 g of OMSW‐LP per kg for 40 days. Blood examinations indicated that the OMSW‐LP diet significantly reduced thiobarbituric acid‐reactive species and protein carbonyls, while enhancing free radical scavenging activity, reduced glutathione levels and CAT activity. These findings suggest that the dietary inclusion of solid‐state‐fermented OMSW‐LP can improve antioxidant profiles, which is essential for the health and growth of piglets post‐weaning (Eliopoulos et al.2024). The mineral composition of dairy products is influenced by various factors, including the genetic traits of the dairy cows, their lactation stage and their diet. In this context, a study was conducted to examine the mineral content in Provola cheeses produced from dairy cows that were fed two different integrated diets: one supplemented with Biotrak and another serving as a control group without any additives (Potortì et al.2024). The findings indicated that the Biotrak cheeses had significantly higher levels of essential minerals, particularly selenium, which ranged from 0.112 to 0.281 mg/kg, approximately double that of the control cheeses. Only cadmium was detected among the toxic elements, with levels averaging below 0.11 mg/kg. Thus, the addition of OC in animal feed effectively enhances the mineral profile of the resulting cheese (Potortì et al.2024). The environmental impact of substituting apple and OP for maize grain in the diets of fattening pigs was investigated (Rebolledo‐Leiva et al.2024). Using life cycle assessment (LCA), the study evaluates four diet alternatives, highlighting a diet with 33% maize and 43% subproducts as the most environmentally effective. It emphasizes the importance of allocation methods for subproduct loads, such as mass, economic and zero‐burdens allocation, to validate strategy assumptions. The consequential LCA suggests the strategy may have both positive and negative environmental impacts, depending on substitutes for maize stover and displaced bioproducts, like those for bioenergy (Rebolledo‐Leiva et al.2024). In another study, the transformation of OMSW and walnut shell (WS) into protein‐rich animal feed was explored using solid‐state fermentation with thefungus Pleurotus ostreatus(Arapoglou et al.2024). A substrate composed of 80% WS and 20% OMSW resulted in the most significant protein enhancement, achieving 7.57% of its total mass, which represents a 69.35% increase (Arapoglou et al.2024). Additionally, this combination led to a 26.13% reduction in lignin content. Furthermore, the procedure increased the β‐glucan content threefold, reaching 6.94% of the substrate's mass (Arapoglou et al.2024). These findings suggest the potential of OMSW and WS mixtures as effective substrates for developing novel animal feed, aiding in addressing protein shortages and reducing the environmental impact of agro‐industrial processes in‐line with circular economy principles (Arapoglou et al.2024). In a separate study, the main phenolic compounds identified in spray‐dried olive oil mill wastewater were analysed. These compounds included oleuropein derivatives (54.67%), tyrosol (17.03%), hydroxytyrosol (12.35%), verbascoside (5.83%) and hydroxytyryloleate (4.70%) (Cifuni et al.2023). Additionally, the wastewater contains other phenolic compounds such as caffeic acid, vanillic acid,p‐coumaric acid, apigenin, luteolin, diosmetin, rutin and oleuropein (Cifuni et al.2023). The total concentration of the identified phenolic compounds in the spray‐dried olive oil mill wastewater was found to be 11,991 mg/kg (Cifuni et al.2023). In a study, the impact of a novel silage, composed of olive mill wastewater, GP and deproteinized feta cheese whey, in broiler chicken diets was assessed (Bonos et al.2022). A total of 216 male Ross‐308 chicks were allocated to three groups receiving diets with 0%, 5% or 10% silage. Results showed that a 10% silage inclusion significantly increased final body weight and feed intake, and it positively modified jejunum and cecum microflora, as well as meat microflora (Bonos et al.2022). Additionally, thigh meat's oxidative stability improved, and significant differences were observed in fatty acid profiles between supplemented treatments and controls. They demonstrated that the novel silage could enhance broiler performance and meat quality (Bonos et al.2022). Due to rising animal feed costs, there is an ongoing need for alternative funding sources to replace high‐cost raw materials in animal feed. In a study, researchers explored the effects of alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP) pretreatment on improving the in vitro rumen digestibility of exhausted OP (EOP), which is a widely available agricultural BP (Masmoudi et al.2024). Under optimized conditions (1.6% H2O2, 5% NaOH), the phenolic content in treated OP (TOP) significantly decreased, and approximately 25% of lignin was removed. TOP exhibited improved nutritional parameters, showing higher yields of CP and fibres compared to untreated EOP. Enzymatic hydrolysis demonstrated a 48% reducing sugar yield for TOP, whereas IVOMD and ME were also significantly higher in TOP than EOP. Overall, AHP pretreatment effectively detoxifies EOP and enhances its suitability as animal feed (Masmoudi et al.2024). Additionally, a study focused on the incorporation of OP into ruminant feed, emphasizing its potential to address environmental issues related to OP disposal, decrease food‐feed competition and improve food security (Mnisi et al.2024). Despite its benefits, OP's high fibre and low CP content limit its nutritional value. The researchers evaluated the impact of oyster mushrooms (OYM) on the nutritive value of OP by assessing its chemical composition and in vitro ruminal fermentation parameters after cultivating OYM on varying percentages of OP. Results indicated that OYM significantly improved the nutritional profile of OP by increasing DM, OM and CP while decreasing fibre content. This bioconversion approach not only enhances feed quality but also addresses waste disposal concerns and offers economic benefits to the olive oil industry (Mnisi et al.2024). In another study, six types of OC from the Trás‐os‐Montes and Alto Douro regions were examined, with an assessment of their chemical properties conducted through conventional analyses (Paié‐Ribeiro et al.2024). The key findings revealed that the dehydrated TPOC had the lowest moisture content (8%), whereas crude olive cake (COC) displayed high crude fat (14.5%) and varying protein levels (5.3%–7.3%). The NDF was notably high (>65%), indicating significant lignification. Furthermore, COC had the highest MUFA, whereas exhausted OC showed higher saturated and PUFAs. The phosphorus and phytic acid contents were comparable among most samples. These findings suggest that OC, particularly dry two‐phase OC, possesses beneficial properties for transport, conservation and utilization, presenting a viable option for reducing waste in the olive oil industry (Paié‐Ribeiro et al.2024). Some researchers investigated the impact of OP on OM degradation through vermicomposting, utilizingEisenia fetidaearthworms for the process (Akpinar Borazan et al.2024). Various biomass mixtures, including eggshells, cabbage and cattle manure, were amended with different OP concentrations (0%, 15%, 30% and 37.5%). After 45 days, analyses, such as nitrogen adsorption–desorption and FT‐IR, were conducted. Results indicated that the addition of OP enhanced biomass compactness and increased earthworm biomass by 31% at 37.5% OP. The study also noted a decrease in C/N ratios with lower OP levels, whereas higher levels led to increased C/N ratios due to elevated nitrogen values. Overall, OP was identified as a beneficial nutritional source for earthworms, promoting OM degradation (Akpinar Borazan et al. 2024). In another study, researchers conducted an investigation into the effects of a dietary intervention using OP oil rich in bioactive triterpenoids, specifically oleanolic and maslinic acid, during diet‐induced obesity in mice (Claro‐Cala et al.2020). The pomace olive oil utilized in the study contained high concentrations of triterpenic acids (referred to as POCTA). The findings indicate that a 10‐week POCTA diet led to significant reductions in body weight, insulin resistance and adipose tissue inflammation, along with improvements in vascular function, despite a high caloric intake. This research highlights the potential of pomace olive oil as a functional food in combating obesity and contributes to the understanding of health benefits associated with the Mediterranean diet (Claro‐Cala et al.2020). In general, olive BPs are abundant in compounds that exhibit antioxidant, antimicrobial, cardioprotective and anticancer properties, making them a promising candidate for the treatment of various diseases in both humans and animals. Simultaneously, their incorporation into the nutrition of ruminants facilitates the sustainable utilization of high‐value bioactive compounds within food chains, enhancing the quality of milk and meat while promoting consumer health. This approach does not adversely impact rumen function, metabolism or overall productivity.

The processing of olives into oil affects olive meal by altering its chemical composition, particularly its phenolic content, fibre and antioxidant properties (Safarzadeh Markhali 2021). Enhanced extraction techniques can improve the nutritional value and functional properties of olive meal, making it a valuable BP rich in bioactive compounds that can be utilized in animal feed, food products or nutraceuticals (Safarzadeh Markhali 2021). It has been shown that ensiling olive BPs with different additives and additions to diets of animals can improve their performance (Taheri et al.2012; Abid et al.2020; Symeou et al.2021).

Tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicumL.) are among the most extensively cultivated vegetables worldwide. It is a significant edible plant that is rich in bioactive compounds, including protein, fibre, carotenoids and pectin (Kiralan and Ketenoglu2022). These compounds are recognized for their protective properties against various human diseases. Tomato pulp, also referred to as tomato pomace, is an agricultural BP derived from the leftover pulp produced during the manufacturing of tomato paste and sauce. It constitutes approximately 2%–10% of the total weight of fresh tomatoes (Hafez2024). Tomatoes are processed into a variety of products, such as ketchup, paste, sauce, puree, soup, juice and canned tomatoes, resulting in substantial waste generation (Kiralan and Ketenoglu2022). A schematic of the parts of the tomato and its pomace is illustrated in Figure7. In this figure, the various parts of the tomato, including columella, endocarp, mesocarp, exocarp (skin), seed, locular gel, funiculus, placenta, pedicel and sepal, are highlighted. Each of these parts can serve as valuable nutritional waste for animal feed after the dehydration process of the tomato. This waste is a valuable source of bioactive compounds that can enhance human health. More than half of the composition of tomato waste consists of fibre, sugars and proteins, with carotenoids serving as important minor components. Lycopene, in particular, is a notable carotenoid that offers significant health benefits (Laranjeira et al.2022). Lycopene, a carotenoid, is responsible for the red colouration of tomatoes. The primary degradation pathways of lycopene during the processing of tomatoes include oxidation and isomerization. Oxidation predominantly occurs at low pH levels, particularly in the presence of light and oxygen during non‐thermal processing methods such as cutting, grinding and storage (Laranjeira et al.2022). TP, a BP of tomato processing, includes the peel, seeds and small amounts of pulp (Kiralan and Ketenoglu2022). These components are often repurposed in various products. Dried tomato waste can be used as animal feed and as an ingredient in meat products, whereas the seeds can be added to baked goods and fermented cereals. Additionally, tomato seeds are rich in oils that contain high levels of carotenoids, contributing to the oxidative stability of the oil. Tomato seed oil offers promising uses beyond culinary purposes, particularly in the production of biodiesel (Kiralan and Ketenoglu2022). The predominant SFA identified in TP is palmitic acid (Lu et al.2022). TP serves as a valuable natural source of lipids (5%–10%), proteins (10%–20%) and dietary fibre (60%–70%) (Hafez2024). TP is notably rich in minerals, especially calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium and potassium. Among these, potassium exhibited the highest concentration, ranging from 303 to 1125 g/kg, with a mean value of 835.5 g/kg. Sodium levels varied between 47.2 and 191.7 g/kg, yielding an average of 97.7 g/kg (Lu et al.2022). The calcium content ranged from 76.4 to 160.0 g/kg; however, the average was reported as 170.3 g/kg, which may be attributed to a potential measurement discrepancy. Phosphorus was represented by a single measurement of 219.7 g/kg. Magnesium levels showed considerable variation, ranging from 3.1 to 251.1 g/kg, yet only one measurement was as low as 3.1 g/kg (Lu et al.2022). Contrarily, other investigations reported magnesium concentrations exceeding 100 g/kg, averaging around 149.7 g/kg. The quantities of iron and zinc were relatively low, with iron levels varying from 1.5 to 11 g/kg and averaging 3.7 g/kg, whereas zinc levels ranged from 0.5 to 6.3 g/kg, with an average of 3.4 g/kg (Lu et al.2022). The predominant essential amino acids identified in the analysis were phenylalanine, leucine, arginine and lysine (Lu et al.2022). Ensuring the quality of final processed products is a key priority for the food processing industry; therefore, it is crucial to take into account the factors that affect the raw materials (Laranjeira et al.2022). Because the quality of BPs is directly linked to the processing techniques and conditions used, it is crucial for the tomato processing industry to receive proper guidance to optimize outcomes. Consequently, variations in the chemical composition and nutritional value of tomato BPs can be attributed to different processing methods. For instance, the concentration of lycopene has been demonstrated to increase following specific processing methods, such as heat treatment (Laranjeira et al.2022). Thus, employing appropriate heating techniques can greatly enhance the retention of nutrients in both tomato‐derived products and the nutritional quality of the TP. Additionally, it contains bioactive compounds such as lycopene and beta‐carotene, which are recognized for their potent antioxidant properties (Hafez2024). β‐carotene is a carotenoid that gives the characteristic orange colour to many fruits and vegetables, making it the second most abundant coloured carotenoid present in tomatoes (Laranjeira et al.2022). It is extensively utilized in the food industry as an additive, particularly as a colouring agent. The primary significance of β‐carotene for human health is attributed to its antioxidant properties and its function as a precursor to vitamin A (Laranjeira et al.2022). Given the abundance of tomato residues, they present a valuable opportunity to be incorporated as agricultural inputs in animal and poultry nutrition. Tomatoes contain lycopene, folate, vitamin C, vitamin A, phenols and flavonoids (Laranjeira et al.2022). Phenolic compounds are significant phytochemicals renowned for their potent antioxidant activity, found in a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. These compounds can be categorized into two principal groups: polyphenols and phenolic acids. Their antioxidant capacity is chiefly attributed to their ability to scavenge reactive species through electronic and atomic exchanges (Laranjeira et al.2022). In tomatoes, notable phenolic compounds include flavonoids, phenolic acids and tannins. The phenolic content in tomatoes is greatly influenced by factors such as agricultural practices, genotype and storage conditions. In many fruits and vegetables, phenolic compounds are predominantly associated with cell walls. Thus, certain processing methods, particularly those that disrupt cell membranes, can enhance the bioavailability of phenolic compounds (Laranjeira et al.2022). The TPCs varied between 94.5 and 213.4 mg GAE/g, with a mean value of 161.8 mg GAE/g (Lu et al.2022). The TFC ranged from 30.6 to 378.7 mg QE/g, averaging 124.4 mg QE/g. Lycopene levels were found to range from 36.7 to 50.2 g/kg, with an average of 44.6 g/kg (Lu et al.2022). The lipids present in tomatoes are primarily in the form of UFAs and are composed of glucose, fructose and essential amino acids (Lamtar Mohammadi et al.2021). Additionally, TP contains various phytochemicals, including flavanones such as naringenin and glycosylated derivatives, as well as flavonols like quercetin, rutin and glycosylated kaempferol derivatives (Aminifard and Kiani2023). Some researchers evaluated agricultural wastes as non‐fasting methods for inducing moulting in laying hens. Five treatments were tested: feed withdrawal, apple peel waste, carrot pomace, TP and zinc oxide (20 g/kg) (Heidari Safar et al.2024). Results showed reduced feed intake in pomace groups without affecting body weight loss. The zinc oxide group exhibited the lowest egg production, whereas the apple peel and TP treatments enhanced production during the resting period. Pomace groups had lower heterophil to lymphocyte ratios and improved yolk colour. Blood tests revealed lower triglycerides in pomace groups, with higher cholesterol and MDA in the feed withdrawal group. Ovary and oviduct weights were lower in pomace groups compared to zinc oxide. In conclusion, they noted that TP and apple peel waste are effective alternatives to feed withdrawal for induced moulting (Heidari Safar et al.2024). Moreover, it assessed the nutritional value of tomato pulp in broiler diets utilizing a multivalent enzyme (Lotfi et al.2021). Broiler chicks were fed different diets: control (no tomato pulp or enzyme), 5% TP without enzyme, 5% TP with 0.2% enzyme, 10% TP without enzyme and 10% TP with 0.2% enzyme for 42 days. The results indicated that chicks on enzyme‐supplemented diets experienced greater weight gain compared to those on diets without the enzyme. The 5% TP with enzyme increased empty gizzard weight compared to control. Serum lipids were unaffected, but TP diets raised high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Villi height in the jejunum and ileum was higher in the 5% TP with enzyme group, whereas the highest villi were observed in the 5% TP without enzyme. The 10% TP diet reduced feed costs per unit of live weight gain by 5%. In general, they demonstrated that using multi‐enzyme improves the nutritional value of TP in broiler diets up to 10% (Lotfi et al.2021). A study was conducted to assess the nutritional value of TP as an agricultural BP for animal nutrition (Aminifard and Kiani2023). The research aimed to compare the gas production and digestibility of TP with WB in vitro. They determined the chemical composition and gas production parameters of both materials and substituted TP at levels of 0%, 5.5%, 5.7% and 10% for WB in the diets of fattening lambs. Results indicated that TP contained higher CP and insoluble fibres compared to WB. However, it exhibited lower gas production potential and digestibility of DM and OM. Nonetheless, the production of microbial protein was greater when TP was included in the diet, and increasing the amount of TP further boosted microbial protein production (Aminifard and Kiani2023). Overall, they noted that incorporating up to 10% TP in lamb diets as a substitute for WB did not negatively impact ruminal fermentation parameters and could be a cost‐effective alternative (Aminifard and Kiani2023). Additionally, the study explored the use of TP as a substitute feed ingredient in poultry diets, highlighting its potential advantages for breeding quails (Malek et al.2021). The study involved 160 Japanese quails divided into four treatment groups (0%, 4%, 8% and 12% TP) over 5 weeks, assessing the impact on progeny performance, organ weights, chick quality and MDA levels in meat. Results indicated that incorporating TP did not significantly affect feed consumption, weight gain or feed conversion ratios. However, quails fed 8% TP exhibited numerically higher feed intake. The quality of newly hatched chicks was notably improved in those from quails fed 8% TP, with better overall appearance and lower MDA content in breast meat compared to controls. Conversely, a higher inclusion level (12%) negatively impacted chick quality, likely due to increased dietary fibre reducing nutrient bioavailability. Overall, the study concluded that although TP does not adversely affect progeny performance, an optimal inclusion level of 8% enhances antioxidant status and chick quality (Malek et al.2021). Moreover, a study was conducted to assess the nutritional and digestibility values of TP both before (TP1) and after the oil extraction (TP2) process (Aminifard et al.2022). In this study, the lycopene content of TP and its ruminal disappearance rate were measured, using a completely randomized design to evaluate gas production in vitro. The study utilized fistulated cows to determine the ruminal degradation parameters of TP over various incubation times. The results indicated that TP1 contained 168 mg/kg DM of lycopene, whereas TP2 had higher levels of CP, NDF and ADF than TP1. The TP2 also exhibited increased gas production, OM digestibility and short‐chain fatty acid production, alongside reduced ammonia nitrogen levels compared to TP1. The ruminal degradability of lycopene was found to be approximately 30%, suggesting that over 70% of lycopene bypasses the rumen. In general, the findings conclude that de‐oiled TP possesses (TP2) favourable nutritional values for ruminant nutrition (Aminifard et al.2022). Growth and reproductive performance are critical parameters within animal production systems, serving as key indicators for assessing animals’ responses to feed, environmental conditions and various production methods. The findings indicated that the body weight, feed intake and feed conversion ratio of broiler chickens were not significantly influenced by the inclusion of TP fermented withA. niger(Gungor et al.2024). Consistent with this finding, a group of researchers reported no significant impact on growth performance when dietary TP was supplemented at levels of 20 and 50 g/kg, respectively (Rezaeipour et al.2012; Faryabidoust et al.2013). This lack of impact may stem from the high inclusion rate of TP in the chickens’ diets, as its elevated fibre and lignin content could impair digestibility, nutrient absorption and utilization, ultimately diminishing productivity. Conversely, an increase in body weight was observed among broilers when supplemented with tomato puree at levels of 5 and 10 g/kg (Selim et al.2013). The variations between these findings could be attributed to the use of different components of tomato BPs and the comparatively lower inclusion levels utilized in the diet. Recent studies have focused on the suitability of substitute protein sources in aquaculture diets. In this regard, a study was conducted to investigate the growth performance and blood parameters of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) fed diets supplemented with tomato paste BP extract (TPE) (Kesbiç et al.2022). The research included five diets with varying TPE concentrations (0%, 0.5%, 1%, 2% and 5%) over a 60‐day period involving 300 fish (Kesbiç et al.2022). Results indicated significant enhancements in relative and specific growth rates, alongside a decrease in feed conversion ratios. Haematological analyses revealed that TPE significantly improved erythrocyte counts, haemoglobin content and haematocrit levels. Biochemical assessments showed that diets containing 1% or more TPE significantly lowered serum glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride levels while increasing total protein, albumin and globulin. The study concluded that a 2% TPE extract could serve as an effective growth promoter in common carp diets without adversely affecting blood parameters (Kesbiç et al.2022). Similarly, a study evaluated the effects of adding TP, with or without enzymes and amino acids, into the diets ofNile tilapiaover an 8‐week period, focusing on growth performance, digestive enzymes, histological parameters and liver gene expression (Hafez et al.2024). Five experimental diets were developed, all maintaining a protein content of 28%, with varying combinations of TP, lysine, methionine and gallizyme. The study found that the groups receiving enzyme supplementation, particularly those with amino acids, showed significant improvements in growth performance metrics, including body weight gain and feed conversion ratio, compared to the control. Furthermore, enzyme supplementation was associated with increased intestinal villi length and goblet cell numbers, whereas liver expression levels of IGF‐1 and GH were significantly elevated in the enzyme and amino acid groups. Overall, the inclusion of enzymes, with or without amino acids, positively influenced both growth parameters and gene expression inN. tilapia(Hafez et al.2024). The inclusion of silages made from surplus tomatoes and olive BPs, along with sunflower oil, in the diet of dairy goats will sustain rumen fermentation and milk production while improving the fatty acid profile of the milk (Arco‐Pérez et al.2017). Hence, two experiments were conducted to evaluate the use of olive and tomato silages as partial replacements for conventional forage in the diets of lactating Murciano‐Granadina goats. In experiment 1, the inclusion of olive BPs silage and tomato surplus silage (TSD), supplemented with sunflower oil, led to higher fat intake, nutrient digestibility and specific fatty acid profiles in the goats’ milk compared to the control diet (Arco‐Pérez et al.2017). Additionally, TSD resulted in lower methane production. Experiment 2 confirmed these findings over a longer period (90 days) with more animals, again showing increased DMI and changes in fatty acid profiles without affecting milk yield. The study suggests that substituting traditional forage with local BPs can enhance the energy balance in dairy goats while maintaining overall nutritional efficiency (Arco‐Pérez et al.2017). Similarly, an assessment was conducted to determine whether the inclusion of BPs, such as GP, pomegranate residues, OC and TP, in the diets of dairy ruminants could improve the nutritional quality of dairy products without adversely affecting production efficiency (Correddu et al.2023). The results indicated that partial replacement of concentrates with BPs generally does not reduce milk yield or composition, though high doses may decrease yield by 10%–12% (Correddu et al.2023). Conversely, positive changes in milk fatty acid profiles were observed with the inclusion of BPs (5%–40% of DM), supporting economic and environmental sustainability while lessening food competition between humans and animals (Correddu et al.2023). They demonstrated that enhancing the nutritional quality of milk fat derived from BPs offers considerable commercial advantages for the dairy industry (Correddu et al.2023). In a study, researchers substituted 10% of the corn silage with tomato paste silage in the diets of dairy cows (Tuoxunjiang et al.2020). It was observed that, although no significant changes were detected in milk production or composition, there was an increase in DMI, digestibility and concentrations of vitamins in the milk (Tuoxunjiang et al.2020). This dietary modification also led to elevated levels of total cholesterol, HDL, cholesterol, serum aspartate aminotransferase, antioxidant capacity and improved immune performance.



A schematic of the parts of the tomato and its pomace.

Similarly, analogous findings were reported when fermented tomato paste was used as a substitute for soybean meal, highlighting an increase in DMI and 4% fat‐corrected milk production (Zhao et al.2012). However, no significant impact was observed on average milk production, feed conversion ratio or the contents of milk fat, protein and total solids (Zhao et al.2012). Importantly, this approach resulted in reduced feed costs alongside increased economic benefits. In contrast, differing outcomes were reported, indicating no significant differences in average daily DMI or the nutrient consumption of DM, OM, NDF and ADF digestibility, as well as no variations in faecal and rumen pH values among the cows fed silage TP (Tahmasbi et al.2004). Furthermore, the nutritional variability of TP for ruminants was assessed, along with its impact on in vitro fermentation when incorporated into high‐concentrate diets (Marcos et al.2019). A total of 12 TP samples collected weekly from 2 processing plants were analysed for chemical composition, fermentation and digestibility. The results indicated that TP exhibits consistent chemical composition across plants and minimal variation over time, characterized by low DM but high NDF, CP and EE. The fermentation of TP in the rumen occurred rapidly, demonstrating significant protein degradability, but exhibited low intestinal digestibility. Replacing soybean meal and barley straw with dried TP in diets enhanced fermentation rates and volatile fatty acid production while reducing ammonia nitrogen concentrations; however, methane production remained unaffected. Ultimately, TP can be included in high‐concentrate diets at levels up to 180 g/kg, maintaining effective rumen fermentation (Marcos et al.2019). TP has also been utilized as a feed ingredient for rabbits. In this regard, a study involved 120 New Zealand White rabbits to evaluate the effects of dried tomato pomace powder (DTPP) supplementation on their performance, blood metabolites, carcass traits and meat quality from 5 to 13 weeks of age (Hassan et al.2024). Four dietary treatments were applied: a control diet and diets supplemented with 0.5%, 1.0% and 1.5% DTPP. Results indicated that rabbits on the 1.5% DTPP diet experienced the highest growth rates and best feed conversion ratios despite lower feed intake. Supplementation improved meat quality by enhancing fatty acid profiles, reducing fat deposition and lowering cholesterol levels. Notably, diets with DTPP elevated beneficial fatty acids and health indices in the meat. Overall, DTPP up to 1.5% positively impacted growth performance and meat quality in rabbits (Hassan et al.2024). Similarly, the impact of DTTP on the performance and digestibility of growing rabbits was investigated (Grioui et al.2019). Fifty‐four 6‐week‐old rabbits were divided into three groups and fed diets with 0% (as control), 10% (DTP‐10) and 20% (DTP‐20) DTP for 6 weeks. The digestibility trial revealed that although DM and EE digestibility remained consistent across groups, CP digestibility significantly increased with higher DTP inclusion. No significant differences were observed in weight gain, ADG, feed intake or feed conversion ratio among groups. Notably, the 20% DTP group exhibited the lowest mortality rate. Additionally, DTP supplementation reduced production costs and enhanced net revenue (Grioui et al.2019). The study concludes that incorporating up to 20% DTP in rabbit diets improves protein digestibility. In general, the high nutritional profile of TP supports its effective use as a value‐added component in animal feed. Incorporating TP into animal diets can enhance feed intake and growth performance, increase the levels of PUFAs andn‐3 fatty acids in meat and improve the colour, nutritional quality and juiciness of the meat (Grioui et al.2019). Additionally, TP supplementation can boost the immunity and antioxidant capabilities of animals, as well as enhance sperm quality. Furthermore, the reduction of rumen pH and methane emissions in ruminants fosters the fermentation activity of rumen microorganisms, leading to improved economic efficiency. To avoid any negative effects, it is crucial to follow the recommended supplementation levels of TP: no more than 15% for poultry, 40% for goats, 15% for cattle and 60% for rabbits (Lu et al.2022). Ensiling promotes the preservation of feed quality by facilitating anaerobic fermentation, which enhances nutrient availability and reduces losses from spoilage, ultimately contributing to improved livestock health and productivity. In this context, it has been reported that the ensiling of tomato BPs enhances their quality, subsequently improving animal performance following their consumption (Fayed2019; Tuoxunjiang et al.2020). Furthermore, the ensiling of wet tomato pomace with dried molasses sugar beet pulp significantly improved its silage quality by increasing DM, ME and IVOMD, while reducing CP, fibre contents and ammonia nitrogen levels, without the presence of butyric acid (Sargın and Denek2017).

The integration of agricultural f into ruminant diets presents a valuable opportunity to enhance sustainability in animal nutrition. BPs from pomegranate, grape, pistachio, saffron, raisins, olives and tomatoes offer significant nutritional benefits, improving feed efficiency and animal performance while decreasing reliance on conventional feed sources. Utilizing these BPs minimizes agricultural waste and contributes to a circular economy by recycling nutrients back into the food system, addressing environmental concerns linked to livestock farming. Furthermore, incorporating agricultural waste can provide economic benefits for farmers by lowering feed costs without compromising animal health or productivity. However, key challenges include the need for further research on optimal incorporation levels and the potential anti‐nutritional factors in some agricultural wastes. To facilitate the adoption of these practices, stakeholders should engage in specific recommendations: Farmers should document the effects of various agricultural BPs on livestock to build a knowledge base on best practices; policymakers can support this transition by offering incentives, such as subsidies or grants, for sustainable practices; and researchers should investigate the nutritional profiles and anti‐nutritional factors of different BPs, providing evidence‐based guidelines for their safe use in ruminant diets. By strategically utilizing agricultural BPs, we can enhance food security and promote sustainable agricultural practices, fostering a more environmentally friendly livestock sector. Embracing innovative methods and encouraging collaboration across sectors will enable the agricultural community to contribute to a sustainable future while meeting the growing global demand for livestock products. This article identifies critical areas for future research and emphasizes the need to prioritize them effectively to guide subsequent efforts. Expanding the call for interdisciplinary approaches, including specific technologies like artificial intelligence in feed formulation and advanced waste processing techniques, would further enhance the integration of agricultural BPs into ruminant diets. Additionally, incorporating regulatory and policy considerations is vital to address potential barriers to the adoption of these innovative feeding strategies, ultimately laying a stronger foundation for future studies in this important field of livestock nutrition.

Freedom from violence and the full realization of reproductive rights are both essential to women’s bodily autonomy, health, and opportunities. Yet the world has far to go in achieving either. According to 2018 WHO global estimates, around 245 million women were subject to physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence (IPV) annually, which remains the most common form of violence against women [1]. Meanwhile, approximately 164 million women report an unmet need for contraception [2]. The consequences of IPV for individual women as well as their children, broader communities, and countries are profound.

IPV can result in extensive and debilitating harm to physical and mental health, with specific consequences including injury, stress-related gastrointestinal disorders, sexually transmitted infections, gynecological problems, chronic pain, depression, anxiety, insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder, and death, among others [3,4]. Women experiencing IPV may also face economic obstacles to accessing health care, including barriers to working or lose their jobs as a result of the violence, making it more difficult for them to leave a violent relationship or attain economic security and independence long-term [5]. IPV also has grave intergenerational health consequences, with children’s exposure to IPV associated with higher risks of neurological disorders, chronic stress, sleep problems, frequent headaches, asthma, emotional and behavioral problems, post-traumatic stress and anxiety disorders, poor nutrition outcomes, as well as education disruptions, substance use disorders, and barriers to employment in adulthood [6,7]. Given its collective toll on health, work, and livelihoods, UN Women has estimated that IPV costs the global economy around $1.5 trillion per year [8].

Among the many consequences of IPV, studies across the globe have found that IPV is associated with adverse reproductive health outcomes, including unmet need for family planning [9–11] and unintended pregnancies [12–18]. Unmet need for contraception is widely recognized as a barrier to women’s reproductive health rights to freely choose the number, timing, spacing, and partners with whom to have children [19]. Unintended pregnancies have profound health implications for mothers and their children. Where reproductive healthcare is limited and abortion laws are restrictive, women facing unintended pregnancies often resort to unsafe abortion methods. Studies have found that complications due to unsafe abortions account for 8% to as many as 13% of maternal deaths each year [20]. Women with unintended pregnancies are vulnerable to increased rates of morbidity and mortality, often exacerbated by poverty, malnutrition, and limited healthcare access [21,22]. Children born from unintended pregnancies are found to have an elevated risk of infant and child mortality [23–25]. Closely spaced pregnancies lead to complications like low birth weight, premature birth, and small for gestational age [26].

Married or cohabiting women rarely cite lack of access or cost related barriers as reasons for not using contraception and DHS data have been useful in revealing reasons why women may not seek contraception [27,28]. A study of DHS data across 52 countries from 2005 to 2014 found that approximately 23% women were not using contraception despite wanting to avoid pregnancy because they or others close to them opposed contraception [27]. Women’s exposure to IPV is strongly linked to increased unmet need for family planning through multiple pathways (see Fig.1). First, sexual violence, a common manifestation of IPV, directly infringes upon women's reproductive rights, resulting in forced or unprotected sex [29]. Second, abusive men are more likely to engage in contraceptive manipulation and contraceptive sabotage to gain control over their partner’s use of family planning and increase their partner’s dependency [30]. Finally, violent relationships are often characterized by fear and controlling behaviors by partners, undermining women’s ability to negotiate contraceptive use for fear of violence [29,31].



Pathways for IPV’s impact on women’s unmet need for family planning. Modified from García-Moreno et al. [31], Moore et al. [29], and Coker [32]

Because IPV is likely to impact both women’s desire for contraception and their ability to access it [33,34], interventions that address IPV may also have benefits for women’s unmet need for family planning. Yet few causal studies have examined the impact of domestic violence legislations [35,36], and no causal studies have looked at what works at a national scale to address IPV and its impact on unmet need for contraception in LMICs. Domestic violence legislations and other laws advancing gender equality can both directly support the realization of women’s fundamental rights by deterring discriminatory acts and providing new mechanisms for recourse when rights are violated and can also meaningfully advance gender-equitable norms, which is critical to long-term change [37,38]. At the same time, legal remedies may be out of reach for the most marginalized women and ensuring that domestic violence laws in particular are both effectively and equitably enforced has been a longstanding challenge across countries. Stigma and family or cultural pressure to avoid reporting, geographic and socioeconomic barriers to courts and lawyers, and inadequate budgets for investigating and prosecuting IPV claims may all hinder effective implementation, especially by women with fewer economic resources. Results of associational studies have been mixed [39,40].

This study helps to fill these gaps in the literature by using longitudinal data to examine whether national laws prohibiting domestic violence affect rates of unmet need for contraception. This study focuses on Africa where high rates of IPV have been reported [1] and unmet need for contraception remains high despite substantial progress over the past twenty years [2]. There is also substantial variation within the region in IPV prevalence and contraception use [2,41,42]. Associational studies across African countries have also found a relationship between exposure to sexual violence, unmet need, and contraception usage [9,43–45], as well as unwanted pregnancies [46,47]. By rigorously comparing women’s experiences in countries that enacted domestic violence laws with those that did not, this study offers causal evidence into the relationship between IPV and unmet need for family planning and how these impacts vary among women with different socioeconomic backgrounds, while generating actionable evidence about the potential of national laws to help address these dual major challenges.

We use difference-in-differences (DD), a widely used quasi-experimental research design, to estimate the impact of domestic violence laws on women’s unmet need for family planning. Exploiting the natural variation in the timing of policy adoption across countries, the DD research design identifies policy impact by comparing the trends in outcomes within and across treatment and comparison countries over the study period. Beginning in the early 2000s, many countries across Africa adopted laws prohibiting domestic violence while many others are yet to legally protect women against domestic violence. We use this difference in legal provisions against domestic violence across countries to isolate the impact of domestic violence laws on unmet need from overall trends across the continent.

The policy data comes from the longitudinal database on domestic violence (DV) laws created by the authors and the WORLD Policy Analysis Center at UCLA. The database covers the period 1990–2021 and uses rigorous techniques developed by WORLD to translate original legislative text into quantitative measures [48], including independent double coding by two policy analysts for each country. This coding process captured how each country's laws regarding domestic violence changed over time, focusing on three key aspects: (i) existence of a specific law against domestic violence, (ii) availability of restraining orders as a legal protection measure, and (iii) classification of domestic violence as a criminal offense. Countries with legislations specifically addressing domestic violence, broader laws prohibiting violence against women, or amendments to penal codes that criminalized domestic violence and established penalties were coded as having legal protections against DV starting from the year the law came into force. Countries with no laws against domestic violence or those lacking mechanisms for victims to seek recourse, such as criminal penalties or restraining orders, were coded as having no legal protections throughout the study period. Notably, no additional or gradual changes in DV laws were observed in the treatment countries during the study period.

The outcomes data came from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) harmonized by the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS). In cases where a harmonized version wasn't available, a researcher at our center harmonized the data from the original DHS survey following the IPUMS codebook. This approach ensured all surveys used the same methods. The DHS surveys target women aged 15–49 and gather in-depth information on health and demographics across over 90 low- and middle-income countries at regular intervals. The repeated cross-sectional DHS data are ideal for making comparisons across many countries over time due to the standardized way these surveys are conducted and their consistent measurement techniques. For our analysis, we specifically focused on African countries with at least two DHS surveys containing family planning data collected between 2000 and 2021. We focused on all married or cohabiting women born after 1975. These restrictions allowed us to examine changes in unmet need for family planning within each country over time.

We merged the domestic violence legislative database and the outcomes data collected by the DHS for countries that met our inclusion criteria in Africa. This results in an analytical sample pooled data from 69 DHS surveys across 23 countries (see Table1). We dropped surveys conducted within two years of DV laws’ adoption because the time elapsed would have been insufficient for implementation and to determine treatment effects. The treatment group comprised 11 countries that have data on women surveyed before and after the adoption of DV laws. The comparison group included 12 countries that either lacked domestic violence laws entirely or implemented them after the most recent available national survey. We used only pre-reform data in Nigeria and included them as part of the comparison group because Nigeria’s DV law was not national.

We used a dichotomous variable indicating women’s unmet need for family planning (yes/no) using DHS’s revised definition of unmet need [49]. It is the sum of unmet need for spacing (women who wanted to delay having another child) and limiting (women who did not want another child) among women of reproductive age who were married or cohabiting, fecund, and/or sexually active. We constructed a binary variable (see Additional file1for details) using this information by coding all women reporting an unmet need for spacing or limiting as 1 and all other women who reported using a contraceptive, having no unmet need, or having a desire for birth within the next 2 years as 0. We excluded women who were infecund, menopausal, or sexually inactive because they had no need for family planning. This is a standard definition of unmet need used across studies in Africa using DHS data [9,50,51].

We considered women legally protected against domestic violence if they were surveyed after DV laws were in force. The legal protections provided women with access to recourse either in the form of restraining orders or criminal penalties against the perpetrator. All women who were surveyed before countries passed DV laws constituted the unexposed category. Table2shows the sample sizes and the prevalence of unmet need for family planning among married or cohabiting women in exposed and unexposed categories for each country in the sample. Among a total of 367,365 married or cohabiting women of reproductive age, 123,199 women were exposed to DV laws. In the treatment group, unmet need was 30.3% among unexposed women and 21.3% among women exposed to DV laws. Unmet need was 22.4% in the comparison group over the study period.

Sample size and sample characteristics of women currently married or living with a partner in the treated and comparison countries

We included as control variables women- and household-level characteristics that are identified as key determinants of unmet need for family planning, particularly in Africa [51,52]. Women’s characteristics included her age in 5-year intervals, total years of education, and age at first cohabitation. Household characteristics comprised total number of members in the household, wealth status in quintiles, and urban/rural location. We also included country-level urbanization rates over time to account for changes in access to family planning services over time.

We used a two-way fixed effects (TWFE) model that allows for multiple groups to change over multiple periods in a difference-in-differences (DD) study setup. It is widely used to estimate the effect of laws and policies [53–55]. TWFE models estimate weighted average treatment effects across countries and time periods while controlling for country-specific and time-specific differences. Accordingly, we use the following equation:

The main coefficient of interest wasβ1that estimates the effect of prohibiting domestic violence in treated countries compared to countries without DV laws.Xictrepresented individual- and household-level characteristics. The model accounted for time-invariant differences among countries as well as shared secular time trends over the study period across countries using country (γc) and year (δt) fixed effects. Finally,Xctcontrolled for potential time-varying country-level confounders.

We used probit models because they are appropriate to analyze binary outcome variables. To estimate the output in terms of predicted probabilities, we calculated average marginal effects using the post-estimation commands, and report differences in the probabilities of unmet need. All models accounted for individual-level de-normalized sampling weights as recommended by the DHS for carrying-out multi-survey pooled analysis [56] and incorporated robust standard errors clustered at the country level.

Apart from estimating the pooled average effect of DV laws across all treatment countries, we also estimated the impact of DV laws in each treatment country individually. To examine country-specific impacts, we compared each treatment country at a time to the comparison group using the same estimation strategy. We could not carry out separate analysis for Benin and Uganda due to lack of overlapping data in the treatment and comparison groups in either the pre- or the post-reform period.

All statistical analyses were conducted using STATA 14.2. The study did not require IRB approval because it used publicly available data that are not individually identifiable.

The validity of TWFE DD estimates rests upon the parallel trends assumption that the trends in unmet need would have remained similar across the treatment and comparison groups in the absence of DV laws. We tested this assumption using the event-study model. The event-study design uses a set of dummy variables to capture the impact of an event in each time period. The data are centered at the time of policy adoption (t = 0) and a set of leads and lags comprise the periods before and after the event. We tested the parallel trends assumption by examining all coefficient estimates during the pre-reform period with reference to the last unexposed group of women (t =− 1). The post-reform coefficient estimates indicate how treatment effects vary over time after the adoption of DV laws.

While we looked at the overall impact of DV laws across all treatment countries and each one of them individually as well, the effects of these laws may vary across women depending on their socioeconomic backgrounds or other characteristics that determine access and use of family planning services. We report the heterogeneity of treatment effects across location, wealth, education, age, timing of marriage, and fertility preferences. Using linear probability models (LPM), we interacted policy exposure with each of these characteristics to determine differential policy effects. We report both the average effect of DV laws on each subcategory as well as the differential effect of the subcategories with respect to the reference omitted category to test statistical significance.

We conduct a range of sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our findings. All models presented control for individual-level covariates and country-level urbanization over time. While religious beliefs may impact women’s unmet need, we do not include religion as a covariate in the main analysis due to data quality and availability issues. Similarly, we do not include partner’s education in the main analysis due to sample attrition. We also consider two macroeconomic indicators that, while not perfect, indicate access to and affordability of family planning services in a country. GDP per capita growth indicates the overall economic situation but could potentially be endogenous if DV laws enable more women to join the labor force and increase their incomes. Domestic governmental health expenditure (as a % of GDP) indicates public investments in overall healthcare, not limiting to family planning services alone. We present analyses including these variables as sensitivity checks.

Additionally, the main pooled analyses comprise 11 treatment countries including Benin and Uganda that were not individually estimable due to lack of overlapping data with the comparison countries. We dropped these countries from the pooled sample to test the sensitivity of the pooled treatment effects to exclusion of countries with insufficient data for country-specific analysis.

TWFE DD models are an extension of the simple 2-group × 2-time period DD models wherein the coefficient is a weighted average of treatment effects across all groups and times (Goodman-Bacon 2018) [57,58]. Sometimes when the treatment timing varies across groups, negative weights may occur if already-treated units act as controls and changes in their treatment effects over time get subtracted from the DD estimate. We examined whether negative weights arise in our analysis and whether the treatment effects are sensitive to these occurrences.

We also re-ran the pooled analysis using the logit model that is widely used to study dichotomous outcome variables. Lastly, as a final sensitivity check, we estimated the model on a subset of currently married or cohabiting women who report no desire for births within the next two years i.e. women who indicate a demand for family planning. Because demand for FP may itself be susceptible to sample selection bias, the main results follow the standard practice of unmet need expressed as a percentage based on women who are married or in a union.

Table3reports the marginal effects (difference in predicted probabilities in absolute percentage points) from the probit TWFE model shown in Eq. (1). These estimates measure the impact of prohibiting domestic violence on the probabilities of unmet need for family planning when compared to countries without such laws. Column (1) shows the estimates from the null model with only country and year fixed effects. Column (2) builds on the null model by controlling for individual-level confounders and finally, column (3) additionally controls for country-level urbanization levels that varies over time. We find that prohibiting domestic violence reduced women’s unmet need for family planning across all specifications. DV laws reduced the probability of unmet need by 6.2 percentage points overall, a 20.5% reduction from the mean.

Controls: Individual-level controls include women’s age in 5-year intervals, education, age at first marriage, family size, wealth, and rural/urban residence. Country-level controls include country’s urbanization rates over time

Table3also reports the impact of domestic violence laws on each of the treatment countries individually. We find consistent declines in 4 countries—Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda, and Zambia. Ethiopia witnessed greatest reduction of 14.9 percentage points, followed closely by Rwanda with 12.4 percentage points due to passage of domestic violence laws. The probability of unmet need declined by 8.7 percentage points in Malawi and by 6.5 percentage points in Zambia. Lesotho and Namibia show reductions in unmet need by around 10 percentage points across the null model and the model controlling for individual-level characteristics. These impacts are sensitive to the inclusion of country-level urbanization rates. Ghana, Madagascar, and Zimbabwe do not show any impact of domestic violence laws on women’s unmet need for family planning. The statistically non-significant results may also be due to insufficient sample sizes before or after policy implementation in many of these countries.

The fundamental model assumption is that the trends in unmet need would have been similar across treatment and comparison countries in the absence of DV laws. To test parallel trends before the adoption of DV laws and homogenous treatment effects over time, we present the event-study plot for the pooled analysis [59] in Fig.2. Figure2provides evidence that there were no differential trends in the probability of unmet need between treatment and comparison countries before the adoption of DV laws. It also indicates homogenous treatment effects over time except a slightly greater impact during the last time interval.



Event-study estimates of the impact of DV laws on the probability of unmet need.Notes: Each time point represents two-year intervals to improve estimation. The graph shows the difference in the probability of unmet need between treatment and comparison countries. Time is centered at the last untreated group. Point estimates of the lag and lead terms are presented along with their 95% confidence intervals. The omitted base category is taken as 1 year prior to the reform, indicated by the solid vertical line. The pre-reform period shows no evidence of divergent pre-trends, and the post-reform period is suggestive of homogenous treatment effects over time

In addition to the parallel trends assumption, another significant challenge to the validity of DD estimates concerns their ability to isolate the impact of the policy from other concurrent changes that might have occurred during the study period. To test the possibility of other concurrent changes impacting access to family planning, we run the model on a group of women who would not be expected to be impacted by DV laws: women who were not married or living with a partner at the time of survey. If the observed change among married or cohabiting women is solely due to DV laws, then the placebo group shouldn’t show any significant change because DV laws do not apply to this group. We find that DV laws had no impact (1.7, 95% CI [− 9.2, 12.6]) on the unmet need for family planning among these women. These findings strengthen the argument that the decline in unmet need followed from the passage of DV laws and not any other policy changes (such as those increasing access to family planning services) or other macroeconomic factors that would have impacted the placebo group as well.

In Table4, we report the heterogeneity of treatment effects across location, wealth, education, age, timing of marriage, and fertility preferences. In Panel A, we find that DV laws impacted women across urban and rural areas. While the impact was substantially higher among women residing in urban areas at 10.4 percentage points than those residing in rural areas at 6.7 percentage points, the difference was not statistically significant. Panel B shows that the magnitude of the impact of DV laws increased significantly with women’s wealth background. The impact was the lowest among the poorest women at 4.5 percentage points and the highest among the richest women at 11.4 percentage points. Panel C highlights the vulnerability of women without any education as opposed to women with at least primary education. DV laws had no impact on women who were not educated whereas the impact grew with women’s education level from 8.0 percentage points for women with primary education to 11.6 percentage points for women with higher education. All differences were statistically significant when compared to women with no education.

Similarly, Panel D highlights the vulnerability of another group of women who are under 20 years of age. While DV laws had significant effects on women across different age groups ages 20 and older, they had no impact on women aged 15–19 years. In Panel E, we examine whether the impact varied across women who married before the passage of DV laws compared to those who married afterwards. The results show that DV laws impacted women regardless of whether they got married before or after the adoption of DV laws. Lastly, the impact of DV laws may vary depending on the difference in fertility preferences between the respondent and the partner. While DV laws reduced unmet need for family planning across the board, the impact was higher among women whose partners wanted the same or fewer children at about 9.5.-8.5 percentage points compared to the impact of 6.1 percentage points among women whose partners wanted more children than them.

Table5presents a range of sensitivity analyses that we conducted to test the robustness of our findings. In Panels A and B, we see that controlling for partner’s level of education or woman’s religious beliefs in addition to previously included individual and country-level covariates does not change our results. Panel C shows that our main findings are also not sensitive to controlling for overall macroeconomic indicators such as GDP per capita growth and domestic government health expenditures. Panel D excludes countries with insufficient sample sizes for individual country-specific impact estimation. The pooled treatment effects remain stable.

We examined whether negative weights arise in our analysis and tested the sensitivity of our treatment effects to these occurrences. We found only three country-year cases with negative weights (see Additional file2). To assess their severity, we removed the data with negative weights from the analytical sample and re-ran the pooled analysis. The result in panel E is the same as our main result, suggesting that the presence of few negative weights did not impact the treatment effects. Lastly, Panel G shows that the coefficient estimate is larger in size among women with a demand for FP. DV laws reduced the overall unmet need by 11.6 percentage points, a 21.3% reduction from the mean, among women with a demand for FP.

This study uses a quasi-experimental design to evaluate the impact of national laws prohibiting domestic violence on women’s unmet need for family planning. We find that domestic violence laws reduced the probability of unmet need by 6.2 percentage points overall, a 20.5% reduction from the mean. As the first study using causal methods to measure how domestic violence laws affect unmet need for family planning, this research makes an important contribution to the literature. While prior research shows that experience of IPV is associated with higher probabilities of unmet need for family planning, our study demonstrates that laws prohibiting IPV have broader implications for the realization of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights. These results are robust to different model specifications and assumption checks.

Despite the recognition that the effectiveness of DV laws can vary significantly depending on factors such as specific legal provisions, enforcement, support systems for survivors, and the broader socio-cultural context, this study found strong evidence that DV laws were associated with a reduction in women's unmet need for family planning across 11 countries in Africa. Underreporting and other obstacles may mean that the observed impact reflects partial implementation and likely represents a conservative estimate. Addressing these barriers, such as improving access to support services, enhancing survivor safety, and challenging societal norms that perpetuate IPV, could lead to a more significant and sustained reduction in IPV prevalence and its associated harms.

This observed reduction likely reflects a combination of normative shifts and law enforcement. Researchers have found that even weakly enforced DV laws can contribute to positive social change by transforming women’s attitudes toward violence and raising awareness about protecting their rights [38,60]. DV laws may reduce the prevalence of IPV [35], which in turn reduces barriers to women meeting their family planning needs [9,43]. Previous literature also demonstrated that DV laws improve women's household decision-making power regarding healthcare and finances [36], which is likely to affect women’s ability to access and use family planning.

Among the 11 treatment countries in our sample, the impacts of domestic violence laws on unmet need were greatest in Ethiopia (14.9 percentage points), Malawi (12.4 percentage points), Rwanda (8.7 percentage points), and Zambia (6.5 percentage points). No significant effects were found in Ghana, Madagascar, and Zimbabwe, but these non-significant results may reflect relatively small sample sizes. Differences in policy design aspects and quality of enforcement could help explain the variation in impacts across countries. Future studies should examine the impact of policy design decisions in DV laws, including what constitutes violence, who is covered, whether it’s a criminal offence and its associated penalties, and access to restraining orders and institutional support systems.

This study also provides new insights into whether domestic violence laws are reaching women equitably. Women across demographics experienced reductions in unmet need, though the magnitude of impact varied for women from different backgrounds. For example, impacts among the richest women were over twice as large as impacts among the poorest women, as measured by wealth quintiles. Similarly, women with higher education experienced a greater reduction in unmet need (11.6 percentage points) than women with only a primary education (8.0 percentage points). The only groups for whom we found no significant effects were women with no formal education and the youngest women (ages 15–19).

In demonstrating the role of domestic violence laws in reducing unmet need for contraception, this study highlights the benefits of laws to the urgent priorities of women’s health, autonomy, and fundamental rights. At the same time, it provides further evidence that the ability of women to decide freely about when, how, with whom, and how many children to have depends on their socioeconomic conditions, communities, and political surroundings. To fully realize reproductive justice, future research should examine whether knowledge of laws, implementation barriers, or other obstacles are driving the variation in these impacts across socioeconomic status and age, among other demographic characteristics. Given the justice system may have limitations [61] in adequately addressing this issue for the most vulnerable and marginalized women, it is critical to identify strategies for more effectively reaching those least served by DV laws.

Importantly, we recognize that prohibiting domestic violence is only one aspect of addressing women’s unmet need for family planning and is only one part of a comprehensive approach to addressing IPV. Future research should consider other factors such as the supply and ease of access to contraceptives and accurate knowledge and awareness of family planning services which are also critical to reducing women’s unmet need for family planning. Furthermore, addressing the vulnerability to IPV and the need for family planning services among unmarried or non-cohabiting girls and women requires further attention.

A common limitation of studies using the DD approach is that despite effectively controlling for secular time trends and fixed country-level characteristics, it's still possible that impact estimates capture the combined effect of the policy and unobserved changes happening within countries over time. We addressed this concern by presenting the results for the placebo group of women who were not married or in union. Our results show that DV laws did not impact unmet need among these women, while they did reduce unmet need among women who were married or cohabiting. The lack of a similar reduction in the placebo group suggests that the relationship between DV laws and unmet need is unlikely to be confounded by other coinciding changes that are likely to impact all women regardless of marital status. If other unobserved factors, like family planning services or campaigns, were significantly influential, we'd expect some effect in the placebo group, unless those factors exclusively targeted married women. We also show in the main results and sensitivity checks that these impacts are robust to the inclusion of other relevant time-varying country-level characteristics such as urbanization levels, GDP per capita growth rate, and domestic government health expenditures.

The study reports the average effect of these laws on women's unmet need across all countries in the sample. It also reports the impact in each country individually. However, the study design does not consider the varying durations of historical exposure to these laws across countries. Although the event-study plot (Fig.2) suggests that, on average, the treatment effects remain consistent over time, variations in the duration of exposure to these laws across countries may explain the observed differences in their impact. Additionally, we used the most widely available and used definition of women’s unmet need available in the DHS surveys. However, several studies point to its limitations and have proposed new measurements that consider women’s fertility intentions and agency in different ways [62–64]. Future research examining how public policies affect different measures of women’s unmet need may provide further insights into the mechanism affected.

Another potential limitation is the presence of negative weights in the Two-Way Fixed Effects (TWFE) model [65]. However, the robustness checks we conducted suggest these negative weights do not have a significant impact on the overall findings. Additionally, the country-specific analyses avoid potential biases that can arise when previously treated countries are included as comparisons because we only used one treatment country at a time to estimate these impacts [66].

IPV and barriers to women’s reproductive autonomy are closely linked. This study demonstrates that domestic violence legislation matters to reducing unmet need for contraception. While fully addressing both IPV and unmet need for contraception will require a wide range of legal, policy, and community interventions, laws addressing domestic violence represent one fundamental step that all countries can take. The potential benefits for women’s health, autonomy, and opportunities—and the intergenerational and societal harms that will result if the current scale of IPV and unmet need for contraception persist—underscore the urgency of action.

Loneliness is increasingly recognized as a critical public health issue that profoundly affects psychological well-being and social functioning. This study evaluates cognitive and behavioral differences associated with different facets of loneliness. We classified 790 German-speaking adults (MAge= 31.86 (12.48), 81% female) as lonely or not lonely based on three dimensions - loneliness frequency, distress, and chronicity - and tested for group differences regarding cognitive and behavioral aspects, as proposed by the cognitive model of loneliness, while controlling for depressive and social anxiety symptoms. The results indicate fair to substantial agreement between the three classification methods. Further, we found significant group differences regarding all components, such as interpretation bias, social avoidance, and self-esteem, with each loneliness classification method. Our findings highlight the multifaceted nature of loneliness and underscore the importance of applying diverse methods to fully capture its complexity. This study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of loneliness and its implications, suggesting that interventions should consider the specific dimensions of loneliness to effectively address its cognitive and behavioral ramifications.

Loneliness is defined as a subjectively distressing emotional state characterized by a discrepancy between the desired and perceived quality or quantity of social relationships [1]. While nearly everyone experiences loneliness at some point in their life, for some, it can become an enduring condition with potentially negative implications for mental and physical health and even increased mortality [see for reviews2–4], elevating loneliness as a global health priority [5]. While the COVID-19 pandemic led to increased loneliness, the effect size of this change was small [6]. Still, pre-pandemic data from 113 countries showed loneliness prevalence ranging from 5.3% to 12.7% across age groups [7], emphasizing the need for continued research and intervention.

Although increased levels of loneliness can have negative health effects, short-term loneliness can prompt individuals to seek out social connections [8]. From an evolutionary standpoint, loneliness is considered to function as a cue indicating endangered social relationships, which should encourage behaviors aimed at reconnecting with existing relationships or establishing new ones [9,10]. Therefore, loneliness can act as a healthy and adaptive response, signaling the need for changes in one’s social life.

In their recent review, Maes and Vanhalst [11] show in their recent review that previous theoretical frameworks and research argue that loneliness in its prolonged/chronic and consequently maladaptive state can be particularly concerning due to its association with cognitive biases and behavioral tendencies, which are described in the cognitive model of loneliness by Cacioppo and Hawkley [12]. This model suggests that loneliness triggers a cascade of cognitive processes that heighten awareness of social disconnection. These processes include heightened sensitivity to subjective social threats, negative attributions, and biased social information processing, which can lead to maladaptive behaviors such as social withdrawal and increased vigilance toward potential social threats and thereafter maintain or increase feelings of loneliness [10,12]. While Qualter et al. [10] discuss how individuals in this state of hypervigilance can escape these maladaptive tendencies and show more adaptive behaviors with interventions, the question remains unclear what cognitive and behavioral patterns are associated with adaptive loneliness. Nonetheless, this distinction between adaptive and maladaptive loneliness highlights the importance of considering not just the presence of loneliness but its persistence, intensity, and cognitive and behavioral consequences. Understanding what maladaptive and adaptive experiences of loneliness encompass remains a critical area for further research.

In trying to examine empirical evidence for the cognitive model of chronic loneliness [12], Spithoven et al. [13] used the social information processing (SIP) model [14] in their comprehensive review on cognitive biases in lonely individuals, that affect various stages of social information processing, from attention to interpretation and response selection in social situations. They highlighted the tendency of lonely individuals to interpret social information in a negative light, anticipate rejection, and have negative self and others’ evaluations, the increased pursuit of avoidance goals, heightened social avoidance/withdrawal behaviors, and fewer social skills, among others [for the detailed review, see13]. More recent findings support the reported tendencies regarding negative interpretation bias [e.g.,15–17], higher rejection sensitivity [e.g.,18,19], negative self-evaluation and low self-esteem [e.g.,20,21], increased social avoidance behavior [e.g.,22], and avoidance motivation [e.g.,23]. All in all, these findings support the hypothesis that lonely people show distorted social information processing in different areas.

Although loneliness is distinct from depression and social anxiety [e.g.,24], it is strongly associated with both [e.g.,25]. Since these conditions also involve biased information processing [for depression see26, for social anxiety see27], it is crucial to account for depressive and social anxiety symptoms when examining cognitive and behavioral differences in lonely individuals. In this study, we wanted to test whether differences regarding social information processing [cf.,13] are maintained when controlling for psychopathological symptoms such as depressive symptoms and symptoms of social anxiety.

Due to the complexity and subjective nature of loneliness, it is challenging to measure it accurately. Most studies thus far used scales such as UCLA Loneliness Scale [UCLA-LS;28] or, the Rasch-Type Loneliness Scale [RTLS;29] (also known as the De-Jong Gierveld Scale) to assess loneliness. While such scales seem to be a robust tool for measuring general loneliness, their predominant use has limitations. According to Maes et al. [30], many items in loneliness scales, including the UCLA-LS and the RTLS, may not directly measure loneliness as defined by Peplau and Perlman [1] (i.e., the discrepancy between desired and actual social relationships), but are rather related or predictive of loneliness to some extent. Moreover, most loneliness measures do not include any timeframe with which reported feelings of loneliness can be referenced [31]. These points can potentially compromise the validity of the findings.

Qualter et al. [31] state that current research often focuses on the frequency of loneliness, for instance, when using most English versions of the UCLA-LS. Other versions of the UCLA-LS [e.g.,32] or the RTLS [29] (also known as the De-Jong Gierveld Scale) use items with categories that reflect agreement [30], which might be interpreted as the intensity. However, Qualter et al. [31] argue that current measures might primarily address the persistence of loneliness-related emotions and behavior and that exploring its severity may be more effectively conceptualized through intensity (e.g., by explicitly asking about the distress connected to loneliness) or duration (e.g., by asking how long feelings of loneliness lasted), or a combination of these measures. They further point toward that Weiss [33] argued that both the frequency and intensity of loneliness should be examined. Despite this longstanding recognition of the importance of frequency, intensity, and duration, there is little exploration into which measures best indicate the severity of loneliness, and most scales were developed without this consideration [31].

Direct measurement of loneliness involves asking respondents explicitly if they feel lonely, using one-item questions such as “Do you feel lonely?” which are mostly used in epidemiological studies. Indirect measurements such as the UCLA-LS are multiple-item scales that do not explicitly use the word loneliness. Shiovitz-Ezra and Ayalon [34] found significant discrepancies between direct and indirect measures of loneliness, with more than half of respondents who reported loneliness on the direct measure but were classified as not lonely on the indirect measure. Similarly, Nicolaisen and Thorsen [35] argue that different prevalence rates might emerge due to the heterogeneity of loneliness measures (direct vs. indirect).

However, the direct single-item measures of loneliness might fail to fully capture the subjective distress of loneliness. To address this, Reinwarth et al. [36] formulated a single item, which tried to include feelings of distress regarding loneliness to provide a better screening tool for large-scale population study. The single-item was formulated as “I am frequently alone/have few contacts” and could be rated as 0 “no, does not apply”, 1 “yes, it applies, but I do not suffer from it”, 2 “yes, it applies, and I suffer slightly”, 3 “yes, it applies, and I suffer moderately”, or 4 “yes, it applies, and I suffer strongly”. They then summarized the responses of the participants [similar to37] and recoded loneliness by combining 0 and 1 “no loneliness or distress”, 2 “slight loneliness”, 3 “moderate loneliness”, and 4“severe loneliness.” The comparison with the three-item version of the UCLA-LS showed similar prevalence rates. They further found a moderately positive correlation (ρ=.57,p<.001), which stands in line with previous comparisons between direct single-items and the three-item version of the UCLA-LS [38]. Despite this comparability, these results further point toward a remaining divergence regarding measurements of loneliness. Here, it can be argued that the single-item might focus on the distress (or intensity) and the UCLA-LS on the frequency of loneliness.

Mund et al. [38] tested different multi- and single-item (direct and indirect) measures for loneliness and demonstrated that single-item measures of loneliness mostly have high correlations with each other and with multi-item scales, and their nomological nets align with established measures like RTLS and UCLA-LS. However, some differences emerged from the nomological nets: the UCLA-LS tended to have higher positive correlations with constructs such as neuroticism and depressiveness and negative correlations with, for instance, extraversion life satisfaction compared to the direct single-item [38]. While this might suggest that indirect measures might capture broader aspects of loneliness, they might have lower specificity than direct approaches. Nevertheless, they also showed that single-item measures are reliable, validating their use as robust tools in loneliness research [38].

In sum, these similarities and differences between measuring methods highlight that direct and indirect approaches may capture overlapping facets of loneliness but might also assess diverging aspects, which can lead to variability in the reported prevalence and associated characteristics of lonely individuals. This indicates that it might be necessary to account for different facets for a more holistic view of loneliness.

When addressing a maladaptive form of loneliness [11], there is considerable heterogeneity in the literature. Often, terms such as “prolonged” or “chronic” loneliness are used to distinguish a maladaptive from an adaptive form [e.g.,39]. However, some scholars define maladaptive forms of loneliness based on frequency [e.g.,40], others based on distress associated with loneliness [e.g.,37], and others based on chronicity [e.g.,41]. To counter this heterogeneity, recent research has increasingly emphasized the importance of assessing loneliness as a multidimensional construct, incorporating different aspects [e.g.,31,42]. These efforts align with the broader need to refine loneliness measurement and account for its diverse manifestations.

In the context of specifically investigating chronic loneliness, the definition of Young [43] has been used as a reference, which characterizes chronic loneliness as loneliness persisting for two years and beyond. Older cross-sectional studies relied on the self-reported duration of loneliness to operationalize chronic loneliness [44–46]. As previously mentioned, Qualter et al. [31] pointed out that most loneliness scales, which are frequently used in recent studies, typically ask participants about the frequency of their loneliness, using Likert-type scales from ‘never’ to ‘always.’ These scales are then also applied in longitudinal studies to classify participants into ‘not lonely,’ ‘temporary lonely,’ and ‘chronically lonely’ groups, where the occurrence of a certain level of loneliness at all time points determines the affiliation to one of the categories [e.g.,47,48–52]. These study designs seem to integrate both duration and frequency aspects. However, one potential issue emerging from this is that it is unclear how well chronic loneliness is encompassed in these studies since changes in loneliness between the time points were not captured.

Maes and Vanhalst [11] suggest that future research should disentangle the duration, frequency, and intensity of loneliness and investigate how these aspects, both individually and in combination, relate to, for instance, health outcomes. Qualter et al. [31] have already implemented this multi-dimension approach by using an adapted four-item version of the UCLA-LS, where they assessed the frequency, intensity, and duration. For instance, regarding the duration, the item “Do you feel a lack of companionship?” was followed by the question “How long does that feeling last when it occurs?” and answered with these response options “1 = hours, 2 = days, 3 = weeks, 4 = months, 5 = longer”. They then employed Latent Class Profile Analyses to identify distinct groups of individuals based on their loneliness experiences. The analysis revealed four groups, each characterized by different levels of loneliness across the three measures. One key finding was that the duration of loneliness, particularly experiences lasting months or years, was critical in distinguishing between these groups [31]. This approach highlights the importance of considering multiple dimensions of loneliness to understand its impact fully.

Our study aims to investigate whether the cognitive and behavioral differences between lonely and non-lonely individuals persist when comparing groups of lonely and non-lonely people based on different aspects of loneliness. Specifically, we first applied three different methods of classifying high vs. low lonely individuals: an indirect measurement of loneliness, a direct measurement of loneliness and the associated distress, and chronicity of loneliness. Then, we test the degree of agreement between these three methods, where we expect to find at least a moderate agreement. Finally, we examine group differences between high vs. low lonely participants for each of the different classification methods regarding different cognitive or behavioral aspects of the cognitive model of chronic loneliness, i.e., regarding interpretation bias, rejection sensitivity, social avoidance behavior, distress disclosure, self-esteem, and avoidance goal intensity, while controlling for depressive and social anxiety symptoms. We expect to find significant differences between lonely vs. non-lonely groups regarding all variables. However, this study is mainly exploratory in nature for the two latter classifications since they are rather new.

A total of 1,389 individuals initially accessed the online survey. Of these, 553 participants (39.8%) did not finish the survey and were excluded from the final sample. To ensure data integrity, bogus items were implemented in the survey, where another 23 participants were excluded. Two participants who reported being under the age of 18 were also excluded. Finally, we used complete-case analysis, leading to the exclusion of an additional 21 participants. The final sample consisted of 790 German-speaking adult participants.

Participants were recruited from the general population between February 2021 and March 2022 through online platforms such as SurveyCircle, social media, and internet forums (e.g.,www.psychic.de). The survey was titled “Survey Study on Loneliness” and was administered online using Qualtrics (Qualtrics XM). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to participation. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Human Sciences at the University of Bern (2020-08-00005).

To participate, individuals had to be 18 years or older and proficient in German. The majority of the final sample were women (81%), with a mean age of 31.86 years (SD = 12.48, range = 18–90). 56.1% were employed, and 47.3% held a university or university of applied sciences degree. In terms of relationship status, 41.7% were single, 52.3% were in a relationship or married, and 3.4% were divorced or widowed.

We assessed high vs. low lonely individuals in three different ways. First, we used the most commonly used way to classify lonely vs. non-lonely individuals by a cut-off applied to an indirect measure of loneliness, i.e., a short version UCLA Loneliness scale, which assesses foremost the frequency of loneliness [see31]. Second, we created groups of lonely vs. non-lonely individuals based on the distress that is linked to loneliness. Third, we created groups applying the 2-year criterion proposed by Young [43] to assess the chronicity of loneliness.

Loneliness frequencywas measured using the German 9-item version [53] of the UCLA loneliness scale [UCLA-LS; [28,54]. Sample items are: “How often do you feel that you lack companionship?”, “How often do you feel that you have a lot in common with the people around you?”. The items were rated on a Likert scale from 1 (never) to 4 (always). Higher scores indicate increased loneliness. The internal consistency in our sample was high (seeTable 1). They were asked how often these statements applied to them in the last four weeks. We dichotomized the scale (1 = lonely vs. 0 = not lonely) with a cut-off point of ≥ 27 for the analyses, similar to Shiovitz-Ezra and Ayalon [34].

Loneliness distresswas operationalized by using two single-items. Loneliness was assessed with a single direct question (“Do you feel lonely?”; rated on a 4-point scale with the response options 0 = “no, never”; 1 = “yes, sometimes”; 2= “yes, quite often”; 3 = “yes, very often”). Further, we assessed the feeling of distress caused by loneliness (“To what extent do you feel distressed by the stated feelings of loneliness?”; 0 = “not at all”; 1 = “a little”; 2 = “quite”; 3 = “strongly”; 4 = “very strongly”). Then, we created a dichotomous variable to combine the two variables similar to Reinwarth et al. [36]: a combination of values from 2 to 3 on the loneliness item and values from 2 to 4 on the distress item were coded as 1 (lonely) and the rest as 0 (not lonely).

Loneliness chronicitywas operationalized by again using the above-mentioned direct single-item question. For participants who reported feeling lonely at least quite often, we asked for how many months this was already the case. We then created a dichotomous variable (1 = lonely and 0 = non-lonely) with a cut-off value of 24 months in accordance with the definition by Young [43], which has been used in previous cross-sectional [44–46] and longitudinal studies [e.g., [47,48–52].

As described above, Spithoven et al. [13] demonstrated in their review that lonely individuals seem to exhibit cognitive and behavioral differences in regard to social information processing compared to non-lonely individuals. To assess several of those components, we used the following questionnaires:

Interpretation biasin socially ambiguous situations was assessed with the respective subscale of the Interpretation and Judgmental Questionnaire [IJQ; [55,56]. The scale was used in previous studies assessing interpretation bias [56–58]. The scale consists of social events with positive, ambivalent, mildly negative, or profoundly negative valence. Five brief vignettes were presented for each valence. Four interpretations for every event were used as the response format, ranging from positive, ambiguous, and mildly negative to profoundly negative, which the participants had to rate for plausibility (“Which of the four answers seems most plausible/appropriate to you?”) by ranking them from one (most plausible) to four (least plausible). We used the subscale of ambivalent situations for the analyses. First, the mean rank of the profoundly negative interpretation was calculated over situations. The score is the mean rank given to the profoundly negative interpretation of the scenarios and ranges between 1 and 4. We reverse-coded the ranks, meaning a higher score indicates more negatively biased processing. The internal consistency in our sample was moderate for the socially ambiguous situations (seeTable 1).

Social avoidance behaviorwas measured with a subscale from the Cognitive-Behavioral Avoidance Scale [CBAS; [59,60]. For this study, the 8-item behavioral social subscale was used (e.g., “I tend to make up excuses to get out of social activities,” “I avoid attending social activities”). The rating consisted of a five-point Likert scale (from 1 = “not at all true for me” to 5 = “completely true for me”), with higher scores indicating increased social avoidance behavior. The internal consistency in our sample was high (seeTable 1).

Rejection sensitivitywas assessed using the adapted adult version [A-RSQ;61] of the Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire [62]. In the A-RSQ, 9 hypothetical interpersonal situations are presented, and respondents indicate how they would feel or think in the stated situations. Participants indicated on a 6-point scale how concerned they would be in that situation (from 1 = “very unconcerned” to 6 = “very concerned”) and how likely they would expect to be accepted (from 1 = “very unlikely” to 6 = “very likely”). Those two responses were then multiplied for each scenario, and afterward, a mean score was calculated with higher values indicating higher rejection sensitivity. The internal consistency in our sample was high (seeTable 1).

Comfort with self-disclosurewas assessed using the Distress Disclosure Index [DDI;63]. It is a 12-item scale designed to measure the degree to which a person is comfortable talking with others about personally distressing information (e.g., “I am willing to tell others my distressing thoughts”). Items are rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = “strongly disagree” to 5 = “strongly agree”). The sum score was used for the analyses with higher values indicating more comfort with self-disclosure. The internal consistency in our sample was high (seeTable 1).

Self-esteemwill be assessed using the 10-item revised German version [54] of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale [64] of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale [RSES;65]. This scale measures the positive and negative aspects of self-esteem. Items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = “strongly agree” to 3 = “strongly disagree”). The sum score was used for the analyses, and higher values indicated higher self-esteem. The internal consistency in our sample was high (seeTable 1).

Avoidance Goal Intensitywas assessed with the Inventory of Approach and Avoidance Goals [IAAM; German: Fragebogen zur Analyse Motivationaler Schemata [FAMOS];66]. The original IAAM consists of 94 items; 57 assess the intensity of approach goals, and 37 the intensity of avoidance goals. In the current sample, we only assessed the avoidance goals of the subscales “Aloneness/Separation,” which has five items (e.g., “not receiving enough love and attention”), “Deprecation/Derogation,” consisting of five items (e.g., “not being respected”), and “Vulnerability,” which comprises of three items (e.g., “to show your own weaknesses”). Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = “not at all terrible” to 5 = “extremely terrible”). The mean over the 13 items was used for the analyses, with higher values indicating higher avoidance goal intensity. The internal consistency in our sample was high (seeTable 1).

Based on the evidence that depression [26] and social anxiety [27] are related to biased information processing and the potential that differences in information processing between lonely and non-lonely individuals might emerge from differences with regard to depressive and social anxiety symptoms, we used the following questionnaires to assess depressive and social anxiety symptoms as covariates:

Depressive symptomswere assessed with the 9-item depression module of the Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9; [67,68]. All nine items correspond to the nine DSM-IV criteria for depression. The items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale (from 0 = “not at all” to 3 = “nearly every day”). The sum score ranging from 0 to 27 was used for the analysis, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of depressive symptoms.

Symptoms of social interaction anxietyare measured with the German translations of the short-form of the Social Interaction Anxiety Subscale [SIAS-6;69]. The six items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale (from 0 = “not at all” to 4 = “extremely”). The sum score ranging from 0 to 24 was used for the analysis, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of social interaction anxiety symptoms.

All questionnaires were presented in a fixed order to maintain consistency. The order was as follows: (1) demographic information, (2) loneliness measures, (3) cognitive and behavioral variables, and (4) psychopathological.

All analyses were conducted in R [70]. First, we calculated the bivariate correlations of all measures. Second, we divided the sample in three ways: lonely vs. not lonely using the ≥ 27 cut-off of the UCLA-LS, distressed vs. not distressed due to loneliness using the two single items, and chronically lonely vs. not chronically lonely using the self-reported duration of loneliness with the 24-month cut-off. Third, we calculated Pearson’sX2-tests for gender and Welch’s two-sample t-tests for age, depressive, and social anxiety symptoms to see if there are significant group differences. Fourth, we tested the degree of agreement between the three classification methods using χ² analysis, which is appropriate for assessing categorical variable associations. Since loneliness classifications in this study are dichotomous (lonely vs. non-lonely), χ² allows us to determine whether the distributions of participants across methods significantly differ beyond random chance. To further quantify agreement, we computed percentages, Cohen’sκ[71], andrφ. Cohen’sκvalues are interpreted as follows: values ≤ 0 indicate no agreement, 0.01–0.20 indicate slight agreement, 0.21–0.40 indicate fair agreement, 0.41–0.60 indicate moderate agreement, 0.61–0.80 indicate substantial agreement and 0.81–1.00 indicate almost perfect agreement [72].rφvalues range from -1 to 1, with values closer to 1 indicating a stronger positive correlation. Cohen’sκrepresents the agreement between classifications beyond chance, whereasrφquantifies the strength of association between classification methods. Fifth, we investigated group differences regarding the three classification methods with gender, age, depressive and social anxiety symptoms, usingχ2-tests for categorical scales and analysis of variance ort-tests for the continuous scales. Sixth, we performed three (for each classification method) two-sided ANCOVA to test group differences regarding interpretation bias, rejection sensitivity, social avoidance behavior, distress disclosure, self-esteem, and avoidance goal intensity while controlling for depressive (PHQ-9) and social anxiety symptoms (SIAS-6) by including them as continuous covariates. This approach allowed us to isolate the specific effects of loneliness facets on cognitive and behavioral variables and ensured that observed differences are not solely driven by underlying psychopathology. Finally, we calculated partialη2for the effect sizes. To account for false discovery rate due to multiple testing, we implemented the Benjamini-Hochberg correction method [73] for the ANCOVAs. The Benjamini-Hochberg correction controls the false discovery rate by ranking p-values in ascending order and adjusting them based on their rank and the total number of tests.

Means, standard deviations, medians, ranges, and zero-order correlations of all study variables, as well as Cronbach’s alpha of all measures, are presented inTable 1. The zero-order correlations revealed that all three facets of loneliness showed significant associations with all constructs connected to the cognitive model of loneliness. The associations of loneliness frequency, loneliness distress, and loneliness chronicity with interpretations bias, rejection sensitivity, social avoidance behavior, and avoidance goal intensity were significantly positive and negative with distress disclosure and self-esteem.

In our sample, based on the different approaches, either 15.95% (frequency), 29.75% (distress), or 19.49% (chronicity) were classified in the lonely group compared to the non-lonely group, in all classification methods, lonely and non-lonely people significantly differed regarding age, depressive and social anxiety symptoms (seeTable 2).

Notes.

Across all approaches, 65.06% of the participants were classified as not lonely in all three aspects, while 12.03% were classified as lonely in one, 15.57% in two, and 7.34% in all three aspect(s).

Overall, theχ2-analyses revealed significant differences regarding the distribution (seeTable 3). The percentage agreement (seeFig 1) between the lonelinessfrequencyand lonelinessdistressclassification was 78.10%, with a Cohen’sκof .40, indicating almost moderate agreement; withrφ=.43, suggesting a strong positive association. For the lonelinessfrequencyand lonelinesschronicityclassification, the percentage agreement was 79.74%, with a Cohen’sκof .31, indicating fair agreement; andrφ=.31, suggesting a moderate positive association. The comparison between the loneliness distress and loneliness chronicity classification showed an 86.96% agreement, with a Cohen’sκof .65, indicating substantial agreement, andrφ=.68, indicating a strong positive relationship. In sum, these results indicate that while there is some overlap between different loneliness classification methods, they are not entirely interchangeable. The varying levels of agreement across measures suggest that each method captures a distinct aspect of loneliness, with distress and chronicity showing the highest alignment and frequency showing lower agreement with the other methods.

Table 3displays the comparison of the three methods of classification with each other. As for the comparison between frequency and distress, most individuals who were not classified lonely in terms of distress also did not in terms of frequency (94.23%). A small fraction of individuals who were not classified as lonely in terms distress nonetheless were classified as lonely in terms of frequency (5.77%). Over half of the individuals who were classified as lonely in terms of distress were not classified as such in terms of frequency (60.00%). Nearly half of the individuals who classified as lonely in terms of distress also classified as such in terms of frequency (40.00%). Regarding the comparison between frequency and chronicity, most individuals who were not classified as lonely in terms of chronicity were also not classified as lonely in terms of frequency (89.62%). A smaller portion of individuals who were not classified as lonely in terms of chronicity were nonetheless classified as lonely in terms of frequency (10.38%). Over half of the individuals who were classified as lonely in terms of chronicity were not classified as such in terms of frequency (61.04%). Nearly half of the individuals who were classified as lonely in terms of chronicity were also classified as such in terms of frequency (38.96%). Finally, the comparison between distress and chronicity revealed that a vast majority of individuals who were not classified as lonely in terms of distress were also not classified as lonely in terms of chronicity (98.02%). A very small proportion of individuals who were not classified as lonely in terms of distress were nonetheless classified as lonely in terms of chronicity (1.98%). More than a third of individuals who were classified as lonely in terms of distress were not classified as such in terms of chronicity (39.10%). Most individuals who were classified as lonely in terms of distress were also classified as such in terms of chronicity (60.90%).

Table 4presents the results of the ANCOVAs testing the mean differences between lonely vs. non-lonely groups for the dependent variables interpretation bias, rejection sensitivity, social avoidance behavior, distress disclosure, self-esteem, and avoidance goal intensity, with age, depressive and social anxiety symptoms as covariates, including partial η² for the effect sizes.

Notes. Age,Depressive and Social Anxiety Symptoms were implemented as covariates. Partial η2values indicate the proportion of variance explained by loneliness classification in each cognitive-behavioral variable. Values below.01 suggest a negligible effect,.01-.06 a small effect,.06-.14 a moderate effect, and above.14 a large effect.

Regarding the groups based on loneliness frequency, the ANCOVA results indicated significant main effects of loneliness score regarding all dependent variables (p-values <.001). They indicate that lonely vs. non-lonely people, in regard to frequency, report more interpretation bias (moderate effect), higher rejection sensitivity (large effect), more social avoidance behavior (moderate effect), lower distress disclosure (medium effect), and lower self-esteem (large effect), as well as increased avoidance goal intensity (small effect).

Similarly, significant main effects were also found in all dependent variables for loneliness distress. These findings indicate that higher distress associated with loneliness is linked to greater interpretation bias (medium effect), higher rejection sensitivity (large effect), more social avoidance behavior (medium effect), lower distress disclosure (small effect), and lower self-esteem (large effect), as well as increased avoidance goal intensity (small effect).

Significant effects of chronicity were found in all dependent variables for loneliness chronicity. Significant group differences between lonely and non-lonely individuals in terms of chronicity were found in interpretation bias (medium effect), higher rejection sensitivity (large effect), more social avoidance behavior (medium effect), lower distress disclosure (medium effect), and lower self-esteem (large effect), as well as higher avoidance goal intensity (small effect).

The present study aimed to explore the cognitive and behavioral differences between lonely and non-lonely individuals by incorporating three different aspects of loneliness. Specifically, we built groups of lonely vs. non-lonely people based on frequency, distress, and chronicity. We then tested the degree of agreement between the three classification methods before comparing lonely vs. non-lonely individuals regarding cognitive and behavioral aspects within all classifications.

The three methods of group building revealed different distributions regarding who is considered lonely and who is not. More participants were classified as lonely with the direct single item connected to distress (29.8%) than with the indirect measure assessing loneliness frequency (16.0%). This stands in line with the findings by Shiovitz-Ezra and Ayalon [34], who also found higher prevalences of lonely individuals when asked directly. However, this contrasts with most previous studies, which either showed similar distributions [e.g.,36] or higher when assessed indirectly [e.g.,74]. Furthermore, this also contradicts findings pointing toward a self-stigma connected with feelings of loneliness [75–77]. As for the degree of agreement between the loneliness frequency and distress method, the results reveal almost moderate to strong agreement. In comparison to the findings of Shiovitz-Ezra and Ayalon [34], the overlap of participants being classified as lonely in both terms was larger. However, over half of the individuals (60%) who were classified in terms of distress (direct measure) were not classified as lonely in terms of frequency (indirect measure), which is in line with the findings by Shiovitz-Ezra and Ayalon [34]. The discrepancies regarding the different distributions and degree of agreement with these findings might emerge due to the possibility that when asked directly, individuals may be more likely to acknowledge and report these feelings due to the immediate reflection on their emotional state. This could contrast with indirect measures that assess loneliness more broadly and abstractly, possibly diluting the immediate emotional impact and leading to lower reported levels of loneliness. Another possibility could be that by using the word “loneliness” in direct measures, individuals can use their own interpretation of loneliness when reporting such feelings. Indirect measures might not account for some of these interpretations, which could mean that certain items do not reflect aspects of an individual’s concept of loneliness. Taken together, our findings suggest that while there is some degree of overlap between the two classification methods, each one of them seems to capture unique aspects of loneliness and, therefore, leads to a different distribution in the two groups.

Our classification methods for loneliness frequency and loneliness duration revealed distinct distributions, with a higher percentage of participants classified as lonely when considering chronicity (19.5%) compared to frequency (16.0%). More than half of the participants who were classified as lonely in terms of chronicity were not classified as lonely in terms of frequency (61.0%). This might suggest that some aspects of longer periods of loneliness are not always observable through indirect methods. The fair to moderate degree of agreement also suggests that while there is an overlap, the two methods might diverge due to unique aspects of loneliness.

Our findings indicate that a lower percentage of participants were classified as lonely when assessed for chronicity (19.5%) compared to distress (29.8%). Around 40% of participants classified as lonely in terms of distress did not classify as lonely for longer than two years. However, the other 60% of the participants who were classified as lonely in terms of chronicity were not classified as such in terms of distress. This is also reflected by a substantial agreement. While the immediacy and salience of emotional distress might lead to higher reporting rates of loneliness distress due to the direct impact on an individual’s well-being, most of the participants experiencing loneliness for longer durations also feel the distress connected to loneliness. However, it has to be noted that the overlap might also partially emerge due to the direct single item being involved in the operationalizing of both loneliness distress and chronicity.

Taken together, our analysis of the degree of agreement between the three distinct classification methods of loneliness - frequency, distress, and chronicity - illuminate some overlaps and important divergences that reflect the complex nature of loneliness as a multifaceted construct. The fair to substantial agreement observed between these methods underscores their relative reliability but also highlights the nuances that each dimension captures about the experience of loneliness. This and the fact that some participants have been classified as lonely in none, one or several aspects of loneliness supports this notion. However, more research is needed to grasp and fully entangle the nature of loneliness and its different aspects [11].

Comparing lonely and non-lonely individuals indicated significant differences in all investigated cognitive, behavioral and motivational aspects regardless of the classification (frequency, distress, and chronicity), even after controlling for age, depressive and social anxiety symptoms. Higher levels of loneliness were associated with greater interpretation bias, rejection sensitivity, social avoidance behavior, lower distress disclosure, and self-esteem, as well as increased avoidance goal intensity. These findings are consistent with the cognitive model of loneliness proposed by Cacioppo and Hawkley [12] and the findings in the review by Spithoven et al. [13].

Lonely individuals exhibited significantly greater interpretation bias, aligning with previous research demonstrating that they tend to interpret ambiguous social situations negatively [15,16]. This bias, in turn, can reinforce rejection sensitivity, where we found significant group differences. Lonely individuals tend to anticipate rejection, leading them to be more vigilant for social threats [78,79], which is theorized to promote social withdrawal [10,12]. Accordingly, our results show that loneliness comes with increased social avoidance behavior. This finding is in line with studies showing that lonely individuals are more likely to engage in behaviors that avoid social interactions [79,80]. Notably, rejection sensitivity has been shown to predict social avoidance behavior [79] and thus may potentially exacerbate feelings of loneliness. These tendencies may manifest in everyday social settings, such as hesitancy to initiate conversations in group settings, reluctance to seek emotional support, or misinterpreting neutral social cues as rejection. Over time, such patterns could contribute to difficulties in maintaining friendships and hinder the formation of new social bonds.

Additionally, our results suggest that loneliness appears to be linked to higher avoidance goal intensity, which stands in line with previous research [81,82]. This means that lonely individuals seem more motivated to avoid negative outcomes. Similarly, Mund and Neyer [83] found significant associations between loneliness and prevention focus (i.e., avoiding harm in social situations). This increased avoidance motivation might contribute to reduced distress disclosure, which corroborates findings of previous studies [84,85] and could potentially hinder relationship formation and deepen (subjective) isolation. Finally, the large effect sizes of the group differences observed for self-esteem suggest that self-esteem is a central feature of all three facets of loneliness. Previous research has consistently found a strong link between loneliness and self-esteem [20,21,86], indicating that low self-esteem might reinforce loneliness. However, there is also the potential for high self-esteem having a buffering effect on loneliness.

While our findings highlight significant cognitive and behavioral differences between lonely and non-lonely individuals, future research could explore potential mediating or moderating mechanisms that shape these relationships. For instance, cognitive biases, such as negative interpretation bias, may mediate the link between loneliness and social withdrawal, reinforcing the cycle of loneliness, as previous cross-sectional studies have suggested [22]. Similarly, self-esteem could serve as a protective factor, potentially buffering against the negative effects of loneliness. Prior research has shown that self-esteem moderates the impact of loneliness on life satisfaction and symptoms of depression and anxiety [87–90]. Examining these mechanisms could provide deeper insights into how loneliness develops and persists, ultimately informing more targeted interventions.

In sum, our analyses confirm the substantial relationship of loneliness with various cognitive and behavioral variables, consistent with the findings by Spithoven et al. [13]. Future research should test how these different components of the cognitive model of loneliness might affect each other over time.

As we circle back to the initial discussion on defining maladaptive loneliness, our results invite reconsidering whether a singular facet of loneliness can fully encapsulate its maladaptive nature. Our findings suggest that different aspects of loneliness, i.e., frequency, distress and chronicity, are associated with maladaptive cognitive, behavioural, and motivational aspects, providing further support for a multifaceted approach [11,31]. Implementing such an approach might provide distinct profiles, which could lead to a clearer prediction of maladaptive loneliness. Similar to Maes and Vanhalst [11], we argue that the inclusion of additional cognitive and behavioral constructs might further help conceptualize maladaptive loneliness since theoretical frameworks suggest the intertwined relationship between them [e.g.,10,12]. However, a major remaining open questions is the scarce research regarding the adaptive nature of loneliness [see for review:11]. A possible reason for the absence of adaptive tendencies in our results could be the cross-sectional design and the focus on more trait-like loneliness, which does not allow for the examination of situational processes that might be adaptive, even if the overall pattern of loneliness appears maladaptive. For instance, Reissmann et al. [8] used experience sampling methodology (ESM) to track fluctuations in social interactions in response to momentary feelings of loneliness, prompting participants multiple times a day to report their loneliness levels and social interactions. Their findings indicated that loneliness led to both increases and decreases in subsequent social interactions [8].

Our study underscores the complex and multifaceted nature of loneliness, demonstrating that it encompasses more than mere frequency. This reinforces the need to consider more aspects of loneliness - such as emotional distress and chronicity - when studying its impacts and developing interventions. Recognizing these diverse dimensions can refine theoretical models and enhance intervention specificity. Further, the development of comprehensive measurement tools that capture the multifaceted nature of loneliness is crucial [30,31]. These tools should be validated across different cultures and demographics to ensure their sensitivity and accuracy. In practice, our findings suggest that interventions should be tailored, addressing the emotional distress and the cognitive and behavioral patterns associated with loneliness and/or enhancing social skills and/or self-esteem [91,92]. Similarly, Käll et al. [39] argue against “one-size fits all” approaches and suggest modular interventions that address specific cognitive, emotional, and behavioral mechanisms of loneliness may be more effective. For instance, those experiencing frequent loneliness might benefit from cognitive restructuring, while individuals with high distress could focus on emotional regulation, and those with chronic loneliness may require interventions targeting long-term avoidance patterns and social skills training. However, future research is needed to systematically examine how different intervention strategies can be tailored to distinct dimensions of loneliness. Overall, this study highlights the importance of a comprehensive understanding and targeted interventions to effectively address loneliness, contributing to improved mental health outcomes and social connections for those affected.

Despite the strengths of this study, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, while our findings indicate significant differences in cognitive and behavioral processes across different loneliness classifications, the cross-sectional design does not allow for conclusions about causality. Future research should employ longitudinal designs to disentangle whether cognitive biases and behavioral tendencies contribute to loneliness persistence or emerge as a consequence of prolonged loneliness. Second, a potential limitation of this study is the presence of self-selection bias, which may have influenced the characteristics of our sample. Given that our study was explicitly advertised as a study on loneliness, it is possible that individuals who experience loneliness were more motivated to participate, leading to an overrepresentation of lonely individuals. This may have inflated prevalence rates. Third, the sample was predominantly female (81%), which limits generalizability. While a previous meta-analysis has found that gender differences in loneliness are generally small [93], a newer study reported higher levels of loneliness in men than women [94]. Fourth, our sample was relatively young. While this limits the generalizability of our findings to older or adolescent populations, prior research suggests that key cognitive and behavioral mechanisms underlying loneliness - such as interpretation bias and social avoidance - are relevant across age groups [10,13]. Nonetheless, future studies should investigate whether the relationships observed in our study differ across developmental stages. Fifth, the reliance on self-report measures introduces potential response biases. Participants may have underreported or overreported their feelings due to social desirability or recall bias. Incorporating objective measures of behavioral tendencies [e.g.,95] and cognitive biases [e.g.,96] could help mitigate these biases. Sixth, we also did not account for all potential confounding variables. While controlling for depressive and social anxiety symptoms, factors like personality traits, quality of interpersonal relationships, and recent life events were not considered. Including these factors in future studies would strengthen the findings. Seventh, our operationalization of loneliness chronicity as feelings lasting at least 24 months, while grounded in previous literature, may not fully capture the nuanced experiences of chronic loneliness. More refined measures of chronicity in longitudinal studies could provide deeper insights. Eighth, even though the cut-off points were extracted from previous studies or theories, they remain somewhat arbitrary. Changing these would have also changed the results. Nevertheless, the three methods did not seem to capture the same individuals entirely. Ninth, this study’s assessment of chronic loneliness covered the past 24 months, a period that overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic. This raises the possibility that some participants may have perceived the duration of their loneliness as chronic due to social distancing and lockdowns, even if it could have been primarily situational. However, research suggests that while overall loneliness increased during the pandemic, the effects were small [6]. Given that loneliness is influenced by stable cognitive and emotional factors rather than just external circumstances, the extent of this bias remains unclear. Future research should compare post-pandemic data to determine whether chronic loneliness rates have returned to pre-pandemic levels. Finally, this study it should be mentioned that this study was not pre-registered, which limits transparency in hypothesis testing.

In conclusion, this study provides further support that loneliness is associated with significant cognitive, behavioral and motivational maladaptations regardless of the classification method. These findings underscore the importance of investigating and addressing loneliness as a multifaceted construct and suggest that interventions should focus on cognitive-behavioral components to mitigate its negative effects. Further research, particularly longitudinal studies, is needed to build on these findings, to further investigate the distinction between adaptive and maladaptive loneliness and develop effective strategies to combat loneliness.

Reviewer #1: I would like to compliment the authors on a really well written and clear paper. It doesn't promise anything it can't deliver, and I recognize that the authors explicitly point out its exploratory nature. I would encourage the authors to also upload their analysis scripts to OSF and not just the raw data - I would have liked to have had a look at the code. I think the paper will be a great contribution to the literature, and I have only relatively minor suggestions before I can recommend acceptance of the paper.

Abstract

1. This is just my personal opinion, but “ancova” as a keyword seems strange to me. It's not a specific modeling approach that people might be looking for, nor is it a content-related keyword.

Introduction

2. In the research I was involved in, we looked at the fact that loneliness should be differentiated at the state and trait level. This aspect could fit well in the introduction (only if the authors consider it relevant).

Gründahl, M., Weiß, M., Maier, L., Hewig, J., Deckert, J., & Hein, G. (2022). Construction and validation of a scale to measure loneliness and isolation during social distancing and its effect on mental health. Frontiers Psychiatry, 13, 798596.

3. Overall, I really liked the introduction very much. If the authors could think about how to tighten it up a bit, I think a lot of people might enjoy reading it. The rationale for the approach is well explained. It's a bit sad that the authors did not pre-register their study.

Methods

4. Please provide further information on the survey: How many participants dropped out of the study? Was there a data-related quality/exclusion criterion (e.g., straightlining)? Were the questionnaires presented in random order or always in the same order (which order?)?

Results

5. As the authors state in their introduction, loneliness can also maintain or further reinforce maladaptive cognitive and behavioral patterns. Since this study is cross-sectional, the direction is not clear. I wondered if adding three logistic regressions (one for each division method) using all the outcomes from the ancovas as predictors could also account for this aspect? This is by no means mandatory, it was just an idea that could also be argued against.

Limitations

6. I don't want to start an unrelated Covid debate here. But the question about the last 24 months in 2021/2022 could have led to a distorted self-assessment of chronic loneliness, as many people may have thought about lockdowns etc. This could also (partly) explain the relatively high prevalence of chronic loneliness.

Reviewer #2: I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the opportunity to review your manuscript titled ""Revisiting the Cognitive and Behavioral Aspects of Loneliness: Insights from Different Measurement Approaches."" I deeply appreciate the meticulous and rigorous work you have conducted, and the significant contribution it makes to understanding the cognitive and behavioral models related to loneliness.

Your study highlights the complexity of loneliness and explores its various dimensions, providing a more nuanced and detailed view of this phenomenon, thanks to the use of distinct measures that account for frequency, duration, and distress. The results, which show significant differences in all the cognitive and behavioral components analyzed, form a solid basis for targeted interventions that can more precisely address different forms of loneliness.

After careful review, I would like to offer the following suggestions to further improve the manuscript:

Lines 30-32: The statement on the division of the sample into ""lonely and not lonely"" individuals could be clarified. I suggest adding a more detailed description of the methodology used to distinguish between the different groups, specifying the criteria for each measure more clearly.

Lines 49-51: The control of depressive and social anxiety symptoms is mentioned. It would be helpful to expand this section by providing more details on the methods and tools used to control for these factors.

Lines 121-125: The definition of ""chronic loneliness"" could benefit from further elaboration, explaining the choice of the 24-month period as a threshold for chronicity, perhaps integrating additional studies that support this choice.

Lines 206-210: The results regarding the agreement between the three loneliness measures (frequency, distress, chronicity) could be supported by explanatory graphs that visually illustrate the percentage of agreement and disagreement between the different measures.

Lines 255-265: The interpretation of the correlation between loneliness and social avoidance behavior could be enriched by discussing possible psychological mechanisms that might explain this link.

Lines 350-355: I suggest a broader discussion of the study's limitations. Although depressive and social anxiety symptoms were included, there may be other confounding factors, such as social networks or the quality of interpersonal relationships, that deserve to be mentioned as potential influences not accounted for.

Lines 400-405: It would be helpful to include a dedicated section on the study’s limitations. For example, the cross-sectional nature of the study design might limit causal conclusions. Additionally, the influence of potential self-selection bias in the sample collection should be considered, given that most participants were women and the average age was relatively young.

Lines 425-430: Lastly, I recommend expanding the clinical implications section by providing more concrete examples of how interventions can be adapted to the different dimensions of loneliness identified.

Regarding the data analysis and results, the statistical methods used are appropriate and rigorous, with suitable controls for depressive and social anxiety symptoms. However, I would recommend providing more details on the adjusted p values using the Benjamini-Hochberg method and on interaction effects between the cognitive and behavioral variables. No specific sections need to be eliminated, but I suggest streamlining some parts of the discussion to reduce repetition and make the text more fluid.

In conclusion, the work presented is of great scientific value and significantly contributes to the existing literature. I hope these suggestions will help further refine the manuscript. Once again, thank you for entrusting me with the review of this important contribution.

I would kindly suggest that you include a reference to the following article in your manuscript:

Diotaiuti, P., Valente, G., Mancone, S., Grambone, A., & Chirico, A. (2021). Metric goodness and measurement invariance of the Italian brief version of Interpersonal Reactivity Index: A study with young adults. Frontiers in Psychology, 12, Article 773363.https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.773363.

This article is highly relevant for your discussion on measurement tools, particularly when addressing the methodological aspects related to the validation and reliability of psychological scales. I recommend citing this work in the section where you discuss the psychometric properties of the tools used to measure loneliness, specifically around Lines 150-160, where you explore the reliability and validity of different scales. The reference could enrich your discussion on the robustness of measurement instruments across different cultural and demographic groups.

Reviewer #3: The study ""Revisiting the Cognitive and Behavioral Aspects of Loneliness: Insights from Different Measurement Approaches"" conducted a comprehensive examination of the cognitive and behavioral differences associated with various facets of loneliness in a sample of 790 German-speaking adults. The researchers employed three distinct measures of loneliness—frequency, distress, and chronicity—to categorize participants as lonely or not lonely. They then analyzed group differences in cognitive and behavioral aspects such as interpretation bias, social avoidance, self-esteem, and rejection sensitivity, while controlling for depressive and social anxiety symptoms. The findings revealed fair to substantial agreement between the three loneliness measures and significant group differences in all cognitive and behavioral components for each loneliness measure. This highlights the multifaceted nature of loneliness and the importance of using diverse measures to capture its complexity. The study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of loneliness and suggests that interventions should consider specific dimensions of loneliness to effectively address its cognitive and behavioral implications. I suggest the authors to directly indicate the three definitions of loneliness and the study participants in the title, to be strict. In the introduction, when describing the negative mental and physical health outcomes of enduring loneliness, the authors must be aware of the limited availability of evidence on some consequences of persistent loneliness (PMID: 24550354, PMID: 26905049). I suggest the authors to revise the sentence “While nearly everyone experiences loneliness at some point in their life, for some, it can become an enduring condition with significant negative implications for mental and physical health and even increased mortality, elevating loneliness as a global health priority”. In the part of assessing loneliness, please consider to review the De Jong-Gierveld Loneliness Scale and explain why the authors did not use it. In the methodology, please consider the poor representativeness of the study sample. The authors need to be aware of the different constructs of loneliness in adolescents, adults, and older adults. The online survey was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic but the authors did not have comments on this special social context (PMID: 37562972). My concern the generalizability of the current findings.

Reviewer #4: General Assessment:

The manuscript presents a well-designed and timely study exploring the multifaceted nature of loneliness, using three distinct measures: loneliness frequency, distress, and chronicity. The study's emphasis on understanding the cognitive and behavioral aspects of loneliness through diverse measurement approaches is commendable and contributes to the ongoing discourse on the complexity of loneliness. I do have some comments which I hope will help to authors to further strengthen the manuscript:

1. While the authors acknowledge the cross-sectional nature of the study, additional discussion on how self-selection bias might have impacted the findings (given that participants self-identified for a loneliness study) would be beneficial. More emphasis on potential biases due to the high proportion of female participants (81%) and the relatively young sample would also strengthen the paper.

2. The use of a self-reported measure of chronicity (24 months) could be refined further. While grounded in previous literature, it may not fully capture the nuanced experiences of chronic loneliness, and a more detailed discussion of why this specific threshold was used and its potential limitations would add clarity.

3. Although the manuscript provides a solid analysis of the cognitive and behavioral components of loneliness, the reliance on self-report questionnaires introduces possible response biases (e.g., social desirability or recall biases). Addressing the potential limitations of self-reported data and suggesting alternative or supplementary measures (such as behavioral data) would provide more balance.

4. The implications for interventions could be expanded. While the discussion touches on how different facets of loneliness could guide targeted interventions, more specific examples or suggestions (e.g., interventions tailored to chronic vs. distress-related loneliness) would enhance the practical applicability of the findings.

Specific Comments:

Abstract: The abstract is succinct and informative but could benefit from specifying the sample characteristics (age range, gender distribution) to provide context for the generalizability of the findings.

Introduction: The introduction could briefly address the global health implications of loneliness, especially its rising importance during post-pandemic times, which would make the study even more relevant.

Results: The presentation of statistical results is thorough. However, some readers might benefit from a more intuitive explanation of Cohen's κ and rϕ values, particularly in the context of agreement between the loneliness measures.

Tables: The tables are well-organized and provide essential data. Adding brief interpretative captions below some of the more complex tables (e.g., explaining what constitutes a “strong positive association” in lay terms) could make the findings more accessible to a broader readership.

Reviewer #5: This study presents valuable insights into the cognitive and behavioral aspects of loneliness. The topic of loneliness is highly relevant, particularly in the context of contemporary societal issues related to mental health, the authors provide a comprehensive review of existing literature, framing their research within established theoretical frameworks, and the study employs a multi-dimensional approach to assess loneliness through frequency, distress, and chronicity, which is commendable. However, it requires a more critical approach to theoretical frameworks, measurement choices, and the interpretation of results. Addressing these issues would enhance the overall rigor and impact of the research. The specific issues are as follows.

1. Clarification of theoretical frameworks: the manuscript heavily leans on established theoretical frameworks. However, it lacks a critical assessment of these frameworks. For instance, while the text acknowledges the adaptive aspects of loneliness, it does not thoroughly explore how this adaptive nature contrasts with the maladaptive outcomes. furthermore, a more nuanced discussion regarding the interplay between adaptive and maladaptive loneliness would enhance the theoretical grounding of the study.

2. Measurement choices: the authors critique the use of the UCLA Loneliness Scale and other measurement tools for their limitations, such as not capturing the intensity or duration of loneliness adequately. However, the manuscript does not provide a clear rationale for the selected measures or how they were specifically adapted for this study. In addition, the choice of cut-off points for categorizing loneliness is somewhat arbitrary and lacks a robust justification.

3. Sample limitation: the sample is predominantly female (81%) and relatively young (mean age of 31.86 years). While the authors note the limitations of generalizability, they do not adequately explore how these demographic factors might influence the findings. For example, the experiences and expressions of loneliness may differ significantly across genders and age groups.

4. While the statistical analyses employed, such as ANCOVA and χ2 tests, are appropriate, the manuscript could benefit from a more detailed explanation of why these specific methods were chosen over others. Additionally, the analyses focus on group differences, but they lack a discussion on the potential for mediating or moderating variables that could provide deeper insights into the relationships being examined.

5. The results section presents significant differences across groups; however, the discussion lacks a critical interpretation of these findings. For instance, the authors assert that increased loneliness correlates with higher rejection sensitivity and avoidance behaviors, yet they do not address the implications of these relationships adequately. How might these cognitive and behavioral tendencies manifest in real-life social contexts? A more profound exploration of the practical implications of the findings would enhance the relevance of the research.

Point-by-point response

Comment from the authors:

We thank all reviewers very much for their time and their valuable and thoughtful comments on our manuscript. All revisions are highlighted in the manuscript. We wholeheartedly believe that the suggestions and our respective changes improved the manuscript significantly.

After implementing the comments we streamlined several parts of the manuscript and rearranged the results section to achieve a more logical structure. Further, we adjusted Table 4 by replacing the sum scores with the means and standard deviations of the lonely and non-lonely groups in terms of cognitive and behavioral aspects, since we believe it would be more intuitive information for the reader.

Reviewer #1:

Abstract:

Comment 1:

• This is just my personal opinion, but “ancova” as a keyword seems strange to me. It's not a specific modeling approach that people might be looking for, nor is it a content-related keyword.

• Response: We appreciate this suggestion and agree that ""ancova"" may not be an intuitive keyword for this manuscript. We have replaced it with “social cognition” - a more content-related term.

Introduction:

Comment 2:

• In the research I was involved in, we looked at the fact that loneliness should be differentiated at the state and trait level. This aspect could fit well in the introduction (only if the authors consider it relevant).

Gründahl, M., Weiß, M., Maier, L., Hewig, J., Deckert, J., & Hein, G. (2022). Construction and validation of a scale to measure loneliness and isolation during social distancing and its effect on mental health. Frontiers Psychiatry, 13, 798596.

• Response: Thank you for the suggestion. We appreciated looking into this research and acknowledge the importance of differentiating between state and trait loneliness. However, we refrained from introducing more terms regarding different aspects of loneliness but still incorporated this valuable paper in this section in the introduction:

“However, some scholars define maladaptive forms of loneliness based on frequency [e.g., 40], others based on distress associated with loneliness [e.g., 37], and others based on chronicity [e.g., 41]. To counter this heterogeneity, recent research has increasingly emphasized the importance of assessing loneliness as a multidimensional construct, incorporating different aspects [e.g., 31, 42]. These efforts align with the broader need to refine loneliness measurement and account for its diverse manifestations.”

Comment 3:

• Overall, I really liked the introduction very much. If the authors could think about how to tighten it up a bit, I think a lot of people might enjoy reading it. The rationale for the approach is well explained. It's a bit sad that the authors did not pre-register their study.

• Response: We appreciate the positive feedback on the introduction and have revised it to enhance conciseness while maintaining clarity (see highlighted sections in the manuscript). Regarding pre-registration, we agree and acknowledge this limitation and now mention it explicitly in the limitations section:

“Finally, this study it should be mentioned that this study was not pre-registered, which limits transparency in hypothesis testing.”

Methods:

Comment 4:

• Please provide further information on the survey: How many participants dropped out of the study? Was there a data-related quality/exclusion criterion (e.g., straightlining)? Were the questionnaires presented in random order or always in the same order (which order?)?

• Response: We appreciate the suggestion to provide additional details about the survey procedure and data quality control. We have now included information regarding participant dropout rates, exclusion criteria, and questionnaire presentation order in the Methods section:

“A total of 1,389 individuals initially accessed the online survey. Of these, 553 participants (39.8%) did not finish the survey and were excluded from the final sample. To ensure data integrity, bogus items were implemented in the survey, where another 23 participants were excluded. Two participants who reported being under the age of 18 were also excluded. Finally, we used complete-case analysis, leading to the exclusion of an additional 21 participants. The final sample consisted of 790 German-speaking adult participants.”

“All questionnaires were presented in a fixed order to maintain consistency. The order was as follows: (1) demographic information, (2) loneliness measures, (3) cognitive and behavioral variables, and (4) psychopathological.”

Results:

Comment 5:

• As the authors state in their introduction, loneliness can also maintain or further reinforce maladaptive cognitive and behavioral patterns. Since this study is cross-sectional, the direction is not clear. I wondered if adding three logistic regressions (one for each division method) using all the outcomes from the ancovas as predictors could also account for this aspect? This is by no means mandatory, it was just an idea that could also be argued against.

• Response: Thank you for the interesting suggestion to conduct additional logistic regressions to explore whether the cognitive and behavioral variables predict loneliness classifications. While we acknowledge the importance of examining potential directional influences, we decided not to include these additional analyses for several reasons:

o Our primary goal is to test the cognitive model of loneliness, not necessarily to determine the predictive strength of each component for loneliness classification. While predictive models can be valuable, our study is more concerned with exploring group differences based on loneliness dimensions, aligning with prior literature that takes a categorical approach.

o Since our study is cross-sectional, even logistic regressions would not establish causal directionality. While they could identify associations between cognitive/behavioral patterns and loneliness classifications, they would not clarify whether these variables drive loneliness or result from it. Without a longitudinal or experimental design, directionality remains speculative.

o Adding logistic regressions would increase statistical complexity without necessarily improving practical interpretability. Given the already comprehensive results presented, additional models could make the paper more cumbersome to read

Thus, while we recognize the merit of the reviewer’s suggestion, we opted to maintain our current analytic approach to keep the focus on group comparisons rather than predictive modeling. We acknowledge the study’s cross-sectional limitations and rewrote the first limitations section to acknowledge the suggestion and note that longitudinal studies would be better suited to address causality and directionality concerns.

“First, while our findings indicate significant differences in cognitive and behavioral processes across different loneliness classifications, the cross-sectional design does not allow for conclusions about causality. Future research should employ longitudinal designs to disentangle whether cognitive biases and behavioral tendencies contribute to loneliness persistence or emerge as a consequence of prolonged loneliness.”

Limitations:

Comment 6:

• I don't want to start an unrelated Covid debate here. But the question about the last 24 months in 2021/2022 could have led to a distorted self-assessment of chronic loneliness, as many people may have thought about lockdowns, etc. This could also (partly) explain the relatively high prevalence of chronic loneliness.

• Response: We appreciate the concern regarding the potential influence of COVID-19 on self-reports of chronic loneliness. The 24-month timeframe (2021/2022) coincided with the pandemic, raising the possibility that some individuals might have provided distorted perceptions of the duration of loneliness due to social distancing.

However, evidence suggests that the pandemic did not uniformly increase loneliness across all populations. For example, a meta-analysis by Ernst et al. (2022) found small but significant increases in loneliness prevalence during the pandemic. However, these increases varied across studies and populations, with some reporting no changes or even decreases in loneliness. This might suggest that while COVID-19 may have amplified loneliness for some, it is unlikely to be the sole explanatory factor for chronic loneliness prevalence.

Furthermore, chronic loneliness is not solely dependent on social isolation but is also shaped by stable individual factors, cognitive patterns, and perceived social disconnection. To acknowledge this potential bias, we have added a discussion to the Limitations section:

“Ninth, this study's assessment of chronic loneliness covered the past 24 months, a period that overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic. This raises the possibility that some participants may have perceived the duration of their loneliness as chronic due to social distancing and lockdowns, even if it could have been primarily situational. However, research suggests that while overall loneliness increased during the pandemic, the effects were small [6]. Given that loneliness is influenced by stable cognitive and emotional factors rather than just external circumstances, the extent of this bias remains unclear. Future research should compare post-pandemic data to determine whether chronic loneliness rates have returned to pre-pandemic levels.”

Reviewer #2:

Comment 1:

• Lines 30-32: The statement on the division of the sample into ""lonely and not lonely"" individuals could be clarified. I suggest adding a more detailed description of the methodology used to distinguish between the different groups, specifying the criteria for each measure more clearly.

• Response: We are thankful for this suggestion. Given the space limitations of the abstract, we aim to provide a concise summary rather than a detailed methodological explanation. However, we have slightly clarified the wording to ensure the classification criteria are easily understood. A full description of the methodology is available in the Methods section.

“We classified 790 German-speaking adults (MAge = 31.86 (12.48), 81% female) as lonely or not lonely based on three dimensions - loneliness frequency, distress, and chronicity - and tested for group differences regarding cognitive and behavioral aspects, as proposed by the cognitive model of loneliness, while controlling for depressive and social anxiety symptoms.”

Comment 2:

• Lines 49-51: The control of depressive and social anxiety symptoms is mentioned. It would be helpful to expand this section by providing more details on the methods and tools used to control for these factors.

• Response: Thank you for your comment. We agree that providing more details on the methods used to control for depressive and social anxiety symptoms enhances clarity. To address this, we have expanded the relevant section to specify that depressive symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and social anxiety symptoms were measured using the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale-6 (SIAS-6). Both measures were included as covariates in our analyses to account for their potential influence on cognitive and behavioral differences in loneliness. This information has now been incorporated into the manuscript to ensure transparency regarding our methodological approach.

“Sixth, we performed three (for each classification method) two-sided ANCOVA to test group differences regarding interpretation bias, rejection sensitivity, social avoidance behavior, distress disclosure, self-esteem, and avoidance goal intensity while controlling for depressive (PHQ-9) and social anxiety symptoms (SIAS-6) by including them as continuous covariates. This approach allowed us to isolate the specific effects of loneliness facets on cognitive and behavioral variables and ensured that observed differences are not solely driven by underlying psychopathology.”

Comment 3:

• Lines 121-125: The definition of ""chronic loneliness"" could benefit from further elaboration, explaining the choice of the 24-month period as a threshold for chronicity, perhaps integrating additional studies that support this choice.

• Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We have clarified our operationalization of chronic loneliness in the method section. We based our definition on Young (1982), who distinguished chronic loneliness from transient loneliness by defining it as a state in which an individual has experienced loneliness for two or more years. However, while we followed Young’s definition, previous studies have also used the two-year threshold to define chronic loneliness, either through self-reported duration in cross-sectional studies (George, 1984; Gerson & Perlman, 1979; Hojat, 1983) or primarily in longitudinal designs where loneliness had to be present at two consecutive time points to be classified as chronic (e.g., Lim et al., 2023; Martin-María et al., 2021; Theeke, 2010). Due to the cross-sectional design, we used the former method and adapted it by incorporating the direct single-item with the threshold of feeling lonely at least “quiet often”. We contextualized this more in the introduction and the method sections:

Introduction:

“In the context of specifically investigating chronic loneliness, the definition of Young [43] has been used as a reference, which characterizes chronic loneliness as loneliness persisting for two years and beyond. Older cross-sectional studies relied on the self-reported duration of loneliness to operationalize chronic loneliness [44-46]. As previously mentioned, Qualter et al. [31] pointed out that most loneliness scales, which are frequently used in recent studies, typically ask participants about the frequency of their loneliness, using Likert-type scales from 'never' to 'always.’ These scales are then also applied in longitudinal studies to classify participants into 'not lonely,' 'temporary lonely,’ and 'chronically lonely' groups, where the occurrence of a certain level of loneliness at all time points determines the affiliation to one of the categories [e.g., 47, 48-52]. These study designs seem to integrate both duration and frequency aspects. However, one potential issue emerging from this is that it is unclear how well chronic loneliness is encompassed in these studies since changes in loneliness between the time points were not captured.”

Methods:

“We then created a dichotomous variable (1 = lonely and 0 = non-lonely) with a cut-off value of 24 months in accordance with the definition by Young [43], which has been used in previous cross-sectional [44-46] and longitudinal studies [e.g., 47, 48-52].”

Comment 4:

• Lines 206-210: The results regarding the agreement between the three loneliness measures (frequency, distress, chronicity) could be supported by explanatory graphs that visually illustrate the percentage of agreement and disagreement between the different measures.

• Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We have now added a bar chart that visually illustrates the percentage agreement between the different loneliness measures (frequency, distress, and chronicity). We believe that this addition makes the results more accessible and enhances the interpretation of our findings.

Comment 5:

• Lines 255-265: The interpretation of the correlation between loneliness and social avoidance behavior could be enriched by discussing possible psychological mechanisms that might explain this link.

• Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We have expanded the discussion of the link between loneliness and social avoidance behavior by integrating potential psychological mechanisms that may explain this relationship. Specifically, we now emphasize how interpretation bias and rejection sensitivity may contribute to social avoidance, which in turn limits opportunities for social connection and exacerbates loneliness.

“Lonely individuals tend to anticipate rejection, leading them to be more vigilant for social threats [79, 80], which is theorized to promote social withdrawal [10, 12]. Accordingly, our results show that loneliness comes with increased social avoidance behavior. This finding is in line with studies showing that lo

Selective inheritance of sub-cellular components has emerged as a mechanism guiding stem cell fate after asymmetric cell divisions. Peroxisomes play a crucial role in multiple metabolic processes such as fatty acid metabolism and reactive oxygen species detoxification, but the apportioning of peroxisomes during stem cell division remains understudied. Here, we develop a mouse model and labeling technique to follow the dynamics of distinct peroxisome age-classes, and find that old peroxisomes are inherited by the daughter cell retaining full stem cell potency in mammary and epidermal stem cell divisions. Old peroxisomes carry Glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase, whose specific location on the peroxisomal membrane promotes stem cell function by facilitating peroxisomal ether lipid synthesis. Our study demonstrates age-selective apportioning of peroxisomes in vivo, and unveils how functional heterogeneity of peroxisomes is utilized by asymmetrically dividing cells to metabolically divert the fate of the two daughter cells.

Subject terms:Self-renewal, Cell division

Peroxisomes are essential but their role in cell fate regulation remains understudied. Here, the authors reveal that young and old peroxisomes are not equally distributed in asymmetrically dividing stem cells, and peroxisome inheritance influences daughter cell fate.

In addition to macromolecules like RNAs and transcription factors (reviewed in1), complete cellular components and organelles (e.g. mitochondria2, lysosomes3,4, and centrosomes5,6) can be asymmetrically segregated during cell division to influence cell fate. We previously found that in asymmetric cell division (ACD) of stem-like human mammary epithelial cells (hMECs), young mitochondria are apportioned to the daughter cell retaining self-renewal capacity2. Interestingly, the functional differences between mitochondrial age-classes alter the metabolism and redox state of their recipient cells7, raising the question regarding other redox active organelles, such as peroxisomes. A previous study also suggested that peroxisomes regulate mitotic spindle orientation during ACD of epidermal stem cell (EpSC) and thereby also influence cell fate decisions8. However, whether peroxisomes themselves are selectively segregated during ACD, and whether peroxisomal functions can influence cell fate remains an open question.

To start analyzing age-selective apportioning of mature peroxisomes in ACD, we generated hMECs expressing a peroxisome targeted SNAPtag9(SNAP-PTS1), and labeled peroxisomes sequentially to distinguish old and young peroxisomes (enriched for SNAPtags generated either 23-33 hours, or ≤6 hours before the analysis, respectively) with cell permeable fluorescent SNAPtag substrates2(Fig.1a). Strikingly, a subset of cells apportioned peroxisomes age-selectively (Fig.1a). However, opposite to our earlier findings on mitochondria2, hMECs inheriting older peroxisomes formed more mammospheres, indicating higher self-renewal capacity (Supplementary Fig.1a). To address the potential role of age-selective apportioning of peroxisomes in primary cells, we developed a mouse model where a Lox-Stop-Lox-SNAPtag-PTS1 construct is introduced to the R26 locus (SNAP-PTS1 mouse) (Fig.1b). Mice expressing the peroxisomal SNAPtag ubiquitously (PGK-Cre;SNAP-PTS1) developed normally with a strictly peroxisome specific localization of the SNAPtags (Supplementary Fig.2a–c). We isolated basal and luminal primary Mammary Epithelial cells (mMECs) by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), and cultured them separately in vitro followed by sequential labeling of old and young peroxisomes that was adjusted to mark peroxisomes with SNAPtags imported >51 hours and <5 hours ago, respectively (Fig.1b). While total peroxisomal content of the mother cell was asymmetrically apportioned in subset of both luminal and basal cell divisions (Supplementary Fig.2d), age-selective apportioning was noticed intriguingly only in the basal mMECs (Fig.1b). This observation interestingly aligned with the previous reports that only basal cells give rise to the two mammary epithelial lineages10, prompting questions about the role of age-selective peroxisome distribution in determination of cell fate and lineage.

Therefore, we next focused on the age-selective peroxisome apportioning in basal cells. To probe its functional consequences, we switched to K14-Cre;SNAP-PTS1 mice, where SNAPtag expression is induced during embryogenesis and occurs in both luminal and basal cells of the adult mammary gland (Fig.1c). Sequential injection of SNAP substrates into adult mammary glands revealed heterogeneity in peroxisomal age within the epithelial cells, especially in the terminal end-buds (Fig.1c). Interestingly, basal cells were in general enriched with old peroxisomes and luminal cells had younger peroxisomes (Fig.1c), despite similar proliferation frequency (Supplementary Fig.2e). We next exploited the ability of isolated basal progenitors to regain bipotency and give rise to both basal and luminal lineages upon in vitro culture10–14. We labeled old peroxisomes in vivo and young peroxisomes ex vivo during basal cell isolation, and plated cells for 2D culture (Fig.1d). Importantly, the first in vitro division by primary basal mMECs is known to favor ACD15, and we identified cells that had completed their first division by dilution of the CellTrace-dye (Fig.1d). We then re-isolated daughter cells that had received either high or low portion of the mother cells old peroxisomes (POand PYrespectively in Fig.1d) and assessed their self-renewal potential by seeding them in Matrigel for 3D organoid culture16. Strikingly, POcells formed three times more organoids than PYcells, indicating higher self-renewal capacity (Fig.1e). Moreover, when staining these organoids with keratin 14 (K14) and keratin 8 (K8), the markers for basal and luminal cells in vivo respectively, they contained few cells positive for the luminal cell marker keratin 8 (K8) (Fig.1e). As the organoids originated from K14 positive basal cells (Fig.1d), and we detected no contaminating luminal cells in the original sorted basal cell population (0/180 cells K8 + , Supplementary Fig.2f), these data suggested that some daughters of basal cells may indeed regain bipotency in our assay.

To more formally assess bipotency of POand PYdaughters, we administered FGF2 to organoids to induce branching morphogenesis. As branching requires balanced generation of both basal and luminal cells10,17, branching of organoids initiated from a single mammary epithelial cell lineage indicates bipotent progenitor activity (Supplementary Fig.2g). Organoids from POdaughter cells branched with a significantly higher frequency than the organoids that originated from PYdaughter cells (Fig.1f). Moreover, the branched POorganoids formed a bi-layer structure where cells positive for K14 and smooth muscle actin (SMA) formed the outer basal layer, and K8 positive cells were contained as the inner luminal layer, resembling the in vivo mammary gland organization11,12(Fig.1g). In contrast, the non-branching PYorganoids had a disorganized morphology with overlapping expression of luminal and basal markers, and K8 positive cells at the outer layer. Interestingly, such PYorganoids were quite similar to the organoids formed by primary luminal cells (Fig.1g, Supplementary Fig.2h), suggesting the PYcells had acquired luminal traits in ACD - including loss of bipotency. Importantly, the difference in organoid forming capacity and branching efficiency between POand PYdaughter cells was not dependent on the total quantity of old peroxisomes in the mother cell prior to the division (Supplementary Fig.2i) indicating that the differences emerge during ACD in vitro. Taken together, these results indicated that in ACD, the basal mMEC daughter that receives older peroxisomes is not only more self-renewing, but can also produce two cell lineages in a balanced fashion that indicates bipotency.

We next set out to investigate how selective inheritance of peroxisomal age-classes influences the cellular fate and potency of daughter cells. We adapted FACS to single organelle sorting to separate old and young peroxisomes for mass spectrometry (MS). Due to limited amount of mMECs, we used hMECs for this approach. Briefly, we labeled old and young peroxisomes in intact cells and isolated peroxisomes using differential density gradient centrifugation with iodixanol layering (Fig.2a, Supplementary Fig.3a), and used a mitochondrial dye (MitoTracker) to exclude mitochondria. However, events positive for both peroxisomal SNAP-label and MitoTracker were considered to represent potential interactions between the two organelles (PeroMitoTr+) (Supplementary Fig.3b, c).

We found 68 consistently detected peroxisome associated proteins, which constitutes 35% of peroxisome-associated proteins (68/196)18(Supplementary Fig.3d, Supplementary data1). While the low representation of peroxisomal proteins in our age-selectively sorted samples (Supplemental data1) raises the concern about contaminating proteins, the Snap-label based sorting enriched peroxisomal proteins in comparison to the pre-sorting peroxisomal sample (Supplementary Fig.4a, Supplementary data2). In addition, the 68 detected peroxisomal proteins include both membrane and matrix associated proteins indicating peroxisomes remain intact during sorting. Beside peroxisomal proteins, we also detected proteins of other cellular compartments in all the samples (Supplementary Fig.4a, Supplementary data1,2). Intriguingly, the PeroMitoTr+were particularly enriched with proteins from other organelles in addition to mitochondrial proteins (Supplementary Fig.4a,b), suggesting that they may represent cellular compartments active in inter-organelle communication. However, as our experimental setup limits quantity of the analyzed samples, it is likely that not all found proteins represent bona fide peroxisomal proteins. Consequently, the data set produced by this experiment, which combined traditional peroxisomal isolation with single-organelle sorting, should not be considered as a reference for peroxisomal proteome - but rather a comparison between recently generated and older peroxisomes.

In general, old and young peroxisomes were relatively similar, differing significantly only in the levels of 9 proteins (Fig.2a). Among these, Glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) presented the singular exception that has direct links with the peroxisomal functions, such as lipid, ROS, and NADP metabolism (Supplementary Fig.4c). Although G6PD is primarily localized in cytoplasm, in line with some earlier works18–20, we found that a subset of the abundant G6PD indeed associates with peroxisomes (Fig.2b). Furthermore, G6PD preferentially associated with old peroxisomes, confirming our proteomic analysis (Fig.2b). To test whether the enrichment of G6PD on old peroxisomes is necessary for self-renewal capacity after ACD of mMECs, we inhibited G6PD activity with a small molecule (G6PDi-1)21transiently after ACD, and analyzed the self-renewing capacity of daughter cells. Excitingly, G6PDi-1 reduced organoid forming capacity of the POdaughter cells, but had no impact on PYdaughter cells (Supplementary Fig.5a, b).

G6PDi-1 is expected to inhibit G6PD throughout the cell, and we noted that age-selective asymmetric segregation of peroxisomes did not result in asymmetric apportioning of total G6PD (Supplementary Fig.5c). We therefore probed the specific role of peroxisomal G6PD by over-expressing G6PD in hMECs in three locations: in the cytosol (cG6PD), in the peroxisomal matrix (pmtxG6PD) using PTS1, and on cytoplasmic face of the peroxisomal membrane (pmembG6PD) with the YgiM tail anchor targeting22(Supplementary Fig.5d). Overexpressing cells were analyzed for mammosphere forming capacity (Fig.2c). Excitingly, pmembG6PD increased the mammosphere formation, whereas targeting to the other two locations had no impact (Fig.2c, Supplementary Fig.5e, f).

G6PD is an important enzyme in both the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)23and cellular redox balance activities24. As we previously found that high PPP activity is necessary for maintaining stemness in the daughter cells inheriting young mitochondria during ACD7, we checked weather POhad higher PPP activity than PY. By analyzing the ratio of M + 1 and M + 2 labeled lactate25in POand PYcells that were cultured in media containing 1,213C glucose for one hour after ACD, we found POto indeed have high PPP/glycolysis -ratio (Supplementary fig.5g). However, none of the three G6PD overexpression strategies increased the lactate M + 1/M + 2 ratio significantly (Supplementary Fig.5h), suggesting that other enzymes are responsible for the self-renewal promoting PPP activity7,26. Additionally, supplementing hMECs with the antioxidant glutathione, GSH-ME, did not mitigate the impact of G6PDi-1 on mammosphere formation (Supplementary Fig.5i), indicating that G6PD does not primarily maintain stemness via cellular redox balance. Collectively, these data suggested that the localization of G6PD dehydrogenase activity on the peroxisomes may have local effects on the peroxisomal functions.

G6PD consumes Glucose-6-phosphate and NADP to generate 6-phosphogluconolactone and NADPH. NADPH is involved in multiple peroxisomal metabolic pathways, including, fatty acid oxidation, ROS management by Glutathione, and ether lipid biosynthesis (reviewed in27). Interestingly, peroxisomal ether lipid synthesis depends primarily on two NAPDH-dependent enzymes residing on the peroxisomal membrane, namely Fatty acyl-CoA reductases 1 and 2 (FAR1 and FAR2)27–30(Fig.2d). To address whether peroxisomal G6PD promotes ether lipid synthesis, we analyzed the lipidome of cG6PD and pmembG6PD expressing hMECs. While the total lipid content, or the lipid and fatty acid class compositions were not influenced (Supplementary fig.6a), stearic acid (FA 18:0) was significantly reduced in pmembG6PD cells, accompanied by around 10% increase in the downstream ether lipid PE P-36:1 (Supplementary fig.6b). To address if the increased peroxisomal ether lipid synthesis contributes to stemness maintenance, we used AGPS-IN-2i31to inhibit Alkylglycerone-Phosphate Synthase (AGPS). AGPS acts in the peroxisomal matrix, converting fatty alcohol - produced by FAR1/2 activity on the peroxisomal membrane - into alkyl-DHAP (Fig.2d). Importantly, inhibition of AGPS at a dose that had no impact on normal 2D growth of cells (Supplementary Fig.6c) reduced the mammosphere forming capacity of hMECs and mitigated the boost induced by pmembG6PD (Fig.2e). AGPS-IN-2i also reduced the formation and branching of organoids from primary mMECs (Fig.2f, Supplementary Fig.6d, e). Taken together, these data demonstrate that G6PD on the old peroxisomes contributes to fate determination after ACD via local effects at the peroxisomal membrane, and bring forward the important role of peroxisomal ether lipid synthesis in stem cell maintenance.

Finally, we asked whether age-selective apportioning of peroxisomes also occurs in vivo. As unperturbed mammary epithelial cells do not divide asymmetrically after birth, we focused on epidermal stem cells (EpSCs) that can divide either symmetrically or asymmetrically in the early postnatal skin32. K14-Cre drives SNAPtag-PTS1 expression also in the epidermal basal cells (Fig.3a), and the mitotic spindle angle parallel (0o-10o) with the basement membrane (BM) is considered to mark symmetric divisions, whereas perpendicular angle (60o–90o) is associated with asymmetric cell division in the interfollicular EpSCs32. By examining epidermis after in vivo subcutaneous SNAP substrate administration, we found that the perpendicularly dividing cells apportioned older peroxisomes to the daughter cell that remained at the BM and is therefore expected to maintain stemness (Fig.3b). While majority of the parallel divisions apportioned peroxisomes symmetrically, a small subpopulation interestingly apportioned peroxisomes as age-selectively as perpendicular divisions (Fig.3b). As previous reports indicate that a subset of such parallel-to-BM EpSC divisions can also give rise to daughter cells with asymmetrically predetermined fates33–35, we analyzed the organoid forming capacity36of CD49fhigh;Sca1+basal cells that were enriched either for old (PO) or young (PY) peroxisomes in vivo (Fig.3c, Supplementary fig.7a). In line with our findings on in vitro dividing mammary cells, PObasal EpSCs formed more epidermal organoids than PYcells (Fig.3c). Moreover, while gross morphology of PYand POepidermal organoids was similar, POderived organoids had generated a more robust pool of suprabasal cells positive for Keratin10 (K10) in addition to maintaining a well-defined pool of K14+ basal cells (Fig.3d, Supplementary fig.7b). Altogether, these data indicate that old peroxisomes are inherited by the stem cell daughter during asymmetric divisions of EpSCs in vivo.

Further recapitulating the findings in mammary cells, G6PD inhibition reduced the organoid forming and differentiation potency of POEpSCs but had no effect on PYcells (Fig.3e, Supplementary fig.7c). And finally, inhibiting AGPS activity reduced organoid formation of EpSCs (Fig.3f, Supplementary Fig.7d). Taken together, these data show that age-selective apportioning of peroxisomes occurs in epithelial stem cell divisions, and that peroxisomal ether lipid synthesis is important for maintaining stemness across epithelial tissues.

Asymmetric cell divisions have been mostly studied in non-mammalian systems due to technical challenges, which may bias estimates on ACD frequency in mammalian tissues. The mouse model developed in this study allows age-specific labeling and follow-up of organelle dynamics in ACD. Using in vivo organelle labeling, our study provides evidence demonstrating that mammalian stem cells apportion old peroxisomes qualitatively and age-selectively to the daughter cell destined to become the new stem cell in ACD in vitro and in vivo. Our results also highlight the ability of age-selectively inherited organelles to influence cell fate regardless of the extrinsic factors, but this does not exclude a potential involvement of intrinsic mechanisms such as the Par3-Par6-aPKC polarity complex and the NumA-LGN-Gαi cortical complex (reviewed in35,37–40).

G6PD is suggested to influence stem cell functions by regulating PPP and cellular Redox balance (reviewed in41,42). While we cannot exclude the existence of additional mechanisms, we here discover the role of typically cytoplasmic G6PD specifically on peroxisomal metabolism and how it regulates cell fate through ether lipid biosynthesis. This reveals spatially compartmentalized metabolism as a new level of stem cell regulation, and highlights potential of peroxisomal functions that are particularly dependent on links with other subcellular compartments (reviewed in43). Ether lipids influence membrane organization and dynamics, cellular signaling, and oxidative stress, and they are implicated in neurodegeneration, aging, and cancer (reviewed in44). Whether stem cell regulation by peroxisomal ether lipid synthesis contributes to such conditions is currently not known. Consequently, further studies on how G6PD is recruited to peroxisomes, especially older ones, and how peroxisomal ether lipid synthesis affects stem cell functions are crucial for advancing our understanding of these processes.

Peroxisomes are abundant and typically dispersed in mammalian cells, leading to the assumption that they are randomly distributed during cell division. However, some studies have shown that peroxisomes can aggregate at mitotic spindle poles, either to ensure their inheritance by daughter cells45or to influence cell fate via spindle orientation8. These findings, along with our results on the functions of old peroxisomes in epithelial stem cell maintenance, suggest that peroxisomal segregation during cell division may be more tightly regulated than previously assumed. Interestingly, the proteins identified as key factors in this process are primarily peroxisomal biogenesis factors, such as Pex11b, Pex148, and Pex1946, rather than those associated with cytoskeleton or spindle poles. This indicates that further studies are needed to fully understand the involved mechanisms, and highlights the potential of our age-selective labeling system for investigating this process.

It is also important to note that the labeling strategy used here to separate subsets of peroxisomes according to their chronological “age”, is likely not capturing the complete heterogeneity of peroxisomes. Moreover, peroxisomal turnover and biogenesis are dynamically regulated, and we used only one timing scheme to separate peroxisomal age-classes. Even with these limitations, we discover great heterogeneity in organellar age among cells within tissues (Figs.1c,3a), suggesting that, in addition to asymmetric division, organelle age may impact tissue dynamics and cellular functions more broadly.

Animal housing and experiments were done in accordance to Finnish National Animal Experimentation Board with ethical approval. All mice were maintained in a C57BL/6 background and housed in IVC cages with 12 hours light-dark cycle, at 22oC, with 50-70% humidity and ad libitum access to food (2916, Inotiv).

The SNAP-PTS1 mouse (MGI:6466977) was generated by introducing a CAG-LoxP-3*polyA-loxP- SNAPtag-PTS1 cassette into the first intron of ROSA26 in reverse direction by homologous recombination. To induce the expression of SNAPtag-PTS1 in all the tissues, SNAP-PTS1 mice were crossed with PGK-Cre mice47. For tissue specific expression in epidermal stem cells (EpSCs) and mammary epithelial cells (mMECs), SNAP-PTS1 female mice were crossed with K14-Cre male mice48.

Human mammary epithelial cells (hMECs) line FL249expressing SNAPtag-PTS1 (hMEC SNAP-PTS1) were generated by lentiviral infection. The SNAPtag-PTS1 construct (Addgene, #182883) was generated by replacing the OMP25 sequence of the of Snap-Omp25 plasmid2(Addgene #69599), with the peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1)50. Briefly, the Snap-Omp25 plasmid was restricted with EcoRI and MluI enzymes (New England Biolabs, R3101S, R3198S) to remove the OMP25 sequence. The digested plasmid was purified using GeneJET Gel Extration Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, K0691). Two single complementary stranded oligonucleotides containing PTS1, Mlu and EcoRI restriction sequences were annealed at 95oC for 5 minutes, 25oC for 1 hour in T4 ligation buffer (NEB, B0202S), followed by ligation with the digested plasmid using T4 DNA ligase (NEB, M0202S) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Lentiviruses were produced in HEK293FT cells (Invitrogen,R70007) by transfecting cells with targeting plasmid (SNAPtag-PTS1), packaging plasmid pCMV-dR8.91 and envelop plasmid VSV/G using jetPEI (Polyplus transfection, 101-10 N) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Media containing viruses was collected after 2-3 days and used for cell infection.

hMECs were maintained in MEGM mammary epithelial medium (Lonza, CC-3153) as described before2. For live imaging, MEBM was replaced by phenol-red free MEBM (Lonza, CC-3150).

SNAP substrates (all from New England Biolabs, see below) were dissolved in 6 µl DMSO and diluted with saline to final concentration at desired volume.

For in vivo mammary glands labeling: 240 µl of labeling solution (15 nmols SNAP-Cell 647-Sir (S9102S), 25 nmols SNAP-Cell Block (S9106S), 15 nmols SNAP-Cell TMR-Star (S9105S)) was injected subcutaneously into mammary glands of a mouse at 4 positions within the area formed by mammary gland pair 2-3 (left/right pectoral) and 4-5 (left/right inguinal). Timeline of injections is presented in figures. For organoid forming and branching experiments (Figs.1and supplementary fig.5), SNAP-Cell Sir647, SNAP-Cell Block were injected to mammary glands as above except for SNAP-Cell TMR-star, which was added to collagenase solution during MECs isolation.

For in vivo skin labeling: post-natal day 1-3 (P1-P3) pups were injected subcutaneously at the neck area with 20 µl labeling solution (1.5 nmols SNAP-Cell 647-Sir, 2.5 nmols SNAP-Cell Block, 1.5 nmols SNAP-Cell TMR-Star). A skin area of 1.0 × 1.5 cm surrounding the injection site was collected for tissue processing and imaging.

mMECs was isolated from 11-16 weeks old virgin females. Mammary glands (pairs 2-3 and 4-5) were dissected, finely cut and incubated in 0.01 mg of Collagenase A per 1 g of tissue in mMEC growth media (Advance DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies, 12634028) containing 10% FBS (Gibco, 10270106), 5 ng/ml mEGF (R&D Systems, 2028-WG-200), 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich, I9278), 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich, H4001), 2 mM glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich, 90114 C), 50 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin) with 10 mM Hepes (Sigma-Aldrich, H3375) shaking at 120 rpm for 2 hours at 37oC. The cell suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 400xg to collect the pellet followed by 2-3 pulse centrifugations at 400xg to enrich for mMECs. Next, cell pellets were treated with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (DIFCO, J.T.BAKER) for 7-10 minutes, the cell suspension was filter through a 70 µm cell strainer and centrifuged at 300xg for 5 minutes. The cell pellet was stained with the following antibodies: CD29 FITC (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-102-975), CD326 (Ep-CAM) BV786 (BD; 740958), CD45 PerCP-Cy5.5 (Tonbo Biosciences; 65-0452-U100), CD31 PerCP-Cy5.5 (BD; 562861), Ter-119 PerCP-Cy5.5 (BD; 560512) for 30 minutes on ice (1:500 dilution for all antibodies). After washing with Advance DMEM/F12 base media, cells were resuspended in mMEC growth media with 7AAD (Life Technologies, A1310, 1 µg/ml) for at least 5 minutes on ice before sorting.

Single stained samples were used for compensation control.

After sorting, mMECs were cultured on fibronectin coated plates (Advanced Biomatrix, 5050, 0.5 µg/ml incubated at 37oC for 30 minutes) in mMEC growth media with 10 µM Y27632 (BD Biosciences, 562822) overnight followed by mMECs growth media. Experiments were started after removing Y27632 from culture media otherwise specified separately. mMECs were cultured for maximum 7 days without passing. Media was refreshed every 3 days if needed.

After in vivo labeling, isolation and sorting, basal mMECs were labeled with CellTrace Violet (1:1,000 dilution) in MEGM medium (Lonza, CC-3153) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After washing, cells were cultured in mMEC single cell culture media (mMEC growth media supplement with 500 ng/ml R-spondin (R&D Systems, 3474-RS), 100 ng/ml Noggin (PeproTech, 250-38-250ug) on fibronectin coated 12-well plates for 40 hours at 37oC, 5% CO2to allow cell division in vitro. Cells were treated with trypsin to detach and collected in mMEC single cell culture media with 7AAD (Life Technologies, A1310, 1 µg/ml) for at least 5 minutes before sorting for 3D culture. Cells that had divided (7AAD-, CellTrace Violetlow) were sub-gated into POand PYpopulations based on the amount of old and young peroxisomes.

Cells were sorted into mMECs growth media, centrifuged at 300xg for 5 minutes and plated in 80% Matrigel (Corning, 356231) in mMEC single cell culture media with 10 µM Y27632 for 2 days. For experiments with G6PD inhibitor treatment: G6PDi-121– new G6PD inhibitor with high specific for G6PD (Cayman Chemical Company, 31484) was added during this time to a final concentration of 10 µM. After 2 days, media was changed to mMEC single cell culture media for 6-7 days and refreshed every 2-3 days. For experiments with AGPS inhibitor treatment: AGPS-IN-2i (Aobious,AOB17269) was added during cultured time to a final concentration of 100 µM, media was refreshed every 2-3 days.

For branching assay: following organoid forming assay, media was switched first to mMEC single cell culture media with 2.5 nM FGF2 (Novus Biologicals, NBP2-34921) for 2-3 days and then to mMEC branching media (Advanced DMEM/F12 with 2.5 nM FGF2, 50 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin, 1X ITS (Sigma-Aldrich, I3146). Media was changed every 2-3 days. Organoids were counted after 5-7 days.

EpSCs were isolated from P1-P4 mice. Skin was dissected and incubated in 2 mg/ml dispase II (Roche, 04942078001) in GM2 media (PromoCell, C-20011), shaking at 120 rpm for 1.5 hours at 37oC. The epidermis was removed from the dermis and the epidermis was treated with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (DIFCO, J.T.BAKER) with 1IU DNAse for 7-10 minutes. Cells were scraped from the epidemis, filtered through a 70 µm cell strainer and centrifuged at 500xg for 5 minutes at +4oC. The cell pellet was stained with the following antibodies: CD49f FITC (Biolegend, 313605), Sca-1 Brilliant violet 711 (Biolegend, 108131) for 30 minutes on ice (1:500 dilution for all antibodies). After washing with calcium-free DMEM (Gibco, 32068028), cells were resuspended in GM2 media with Sytox blue (Invitrogen, S34857, 2 µM) for at least 5 minutes on ice before sorting. The EpSCs were identified as Sytox blue-, CD49highand Sca1high. EpSCs were sub-gated into POand PYpopulations based on the amount of old and young peroxisomes. Cells were sorted into GM2 media. Sytox blue was detected in the DAPI channel, Sca-1 was detected in the BV711 channel, CD49f was detected in the FITC channel, Snap sir647 was detected in APC channel and Snap TMR star was detected in PE channel. Single stained samples were used for compensation control. BD FACSAria Fusion Flow Cytometer (Lasers 405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, 633 nm) was used.

After sorting, EpSCs were cultured on collagen IV coated plates (BioNordika, 5031, 0.5 µg/ml incubated at RT for 2 hours) in GM2 media with 10 µM Y27632 (BD Biosciences, 562822) overnight followed by change into GM2 media. Treatments were started after removing Y27632 from culture media unless specified otherwise. EpSCs were cultured for a maximum 4 days without passing. Media was refreshed every 2-3 days if needed.

EpSCs were plated in 80% Matrigel (Corning, 356231) in EpSCs organoid culture media (Advance DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies, 12634028), 2 mM glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich, 90114 C), 50 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, H3375), 50 ng/ml mEGF (R&D Systems, 2028-WG-200), 500 ng/ml R-spondin (R&D Systems, 3474-RS), 100 ng/ml Noggin (PeproTech, 250-38-250ug), 1X B-27 (Fisher Scientific, 11530536), 10 ng/ml Forskolin (Tocris, 1099), 10 µM Y27632 (BD Biosciences, 562822). For experiments with G6PD inhibitor treatment: G6PDi-121(Cayman Chemical Company, 31484) was added for the first 2 days to a final concentration of 10 µM. After 2 days, media was changed to EpSCs organoid culture media for 7-9 days and refreshed every 2-3 days.

Labeling was done at 37oC, 5% CO2.Cells were labeled with SNAP-Cell substrates (NEB) for 30 minutes following by three quick washes with PBS and 30 minutes wash in their culture media. All SNAP-Cell substrate stocks were prepared according to manufacturer’s instructions, the labeling solution was prepared by diluting the stock solution in cell culture media supplemented with 0.5% BSA to a final concentration of 1.5 µM SNAP-Cell Sir647, SNAP-Cell TMR-star, SNAP-Cell Oregon Green or 4.5 µM SNAP-Cell Block.

hMECs were synchronized with a double thymidine block52,53. Labeling was done at 37oC, 5% CO2as described above. In short, cells were treated with 5 mM thymidine (Sigma-Aldrich, T1895) for 19 hours, washed with PBS, detached with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and collected by centrifugation (400xg for 5 minutes). Cells were treated with SNAP-Cell Block (4.5 µM) for 30 minutes. SNAP-Cell block was then diluted with base DMEM media (Sigma-Aldrich, D7777, at least 10X labeling volume) cells were collected by centrifugation and stained with CellTrace Violet (Thermo Fisher Scientific,C34571) according to manufacturer’s instructions. After centrifugation, cells were plated in MEGM. Labeling of old peroxisomes with SNAP-Cell Sir647 (1.5 µM, 30 minutes, 37oC, 5%CO2) was performed on dishes 9 hours after releasing from first thymidine followed by a 30-minute wash with MEGM and second thymidine treatment. Cells were released from second thymidine after 17 hours followed by treatment with SNAP-Cell Block (3 µM, 30 minutes) and 30 minutes washes in MEGM. Young peroxisomes were labeled with SNAP-Cell Oregon Green (1.5 µM, 30 minutes) 6 hours after second thymidine release. At 21-22 hours after second thymidine release, cells were detached with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and collected for cell sorting by centrifugation at 400xg for 5 minutes. Cells that had divided were recognized by low CellTrace Violet staining (DAPI channel) and were sub-gated into POand PYpopulations based on the amount of old and young peroxisomes (APC and FITC channel). Cells were FACS sorted using a BD FACSAria II Cell sorter (Lasers: Near UV 375 nm, Blue 488 nm, Red 633 nm) or BD FACSAria Fusion Flow Cytometer (see above).

For mammosphere assays, cells were sorted into culture medium and plated in 1% methyl cellulose (15 cP, Sigma-Aldrich, M7027) in MEGM on 96-well Ultra Low Attachment Microplates (Corning, 3474) at 200-500 cells/ well, 5-10 wells per population. Mammospheres were counted 10-14 days later. For experiments with G6PD inhibitor treatment: G6PDi-121(Cayman Chemical Company, 31484) was added to a final concentration of 30 µM. For experiments with AGPS inhibitor treatment: AGPS-IN-2i (Aobious,AOB17269) was added to a final concentration of 50 and 100 µM.

G6PD overexpression plasmids were generated in a pRP backbone by inserting the G6PD sequence with or without peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1, YgiM) downstream of the hPGK promoter. In addition, the plasmids contain an mCherry sequence downstream of an IRES sequence. For the control plasmid, the G6PD sequence was replaced by firefly luciferase. mCherry was used as the selection marker for transfected cells in FACS sorting.

To over-express G6PD in hMEC SNAP-PTS1 cells, endotoxin-free plasmids were transfected to the cells using jetPRIME (Polyplus, 101000015) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Cells were plated on MatTek 35 mm glass bottom dishes, No 1.5 (Mattek, P35G-1.5-14-C). One hour before imaging, cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich, 14533, 1 µg/ml) for 12-15 minutes at 37oC, 5% CO2followed by a PBS wash. Live cell imaging was performed in cell culture media at 37oC, 5%CO2on one of the following platforms:

SNAP labeling of peroxisomes was done in intact hMECs as described above with timeline indicated in the figure. Briefly hMECs were cultured in MEGM media for 48 hours and detached with trypsin-EDTA. After centrifugation, cells were treated with 1.5 µM SNAP-Cell Sir647 for old peroxisomes followed by 30 minutes wash in MEGM. Cells were plated in MEGM for 42 hours followed by SNAP-Cell block (3 µM). Cells were then detached with trypsin-EDTA and collected by centrifugation for young peroxisome labeling with SNAP-Cell TMRstar (1.5 µM). After young peroxisome labeling, cells were treated with 150 nM MitoTracker Green FM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, M7514) for 30 minutes. Cells were collected by centrifugation for peroxisome isolation.

Peroxisomes were isolated using Peroxisome Isolation Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, PEROX1) according to the manufacture’s instruction. Briefly, cells were homogenized in 1X peroxisome extraction buffer (provided with the kit) by 7 ml Dounce glass tissue grinder (Sigma-Aldrich, T0566) with small clearance pestle (Sigma-Aldrich, P1235), 20-25 strokes. Samples were centrifuged at 1000 xgand then 2000 xgfor 10 minutes, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 25,000 xgfor 20 minutes. The pellet was collected and suspended in peroxisome extraction buffer using pellet pestle (Sigma-Aldrich, Z35,994-7; Z35,997-1) to obtain a crude peroxisome fraction (CPF). The CPF was mixed with Optiprep Density gradient medium and Optiprep dilution buffer (provided with the kit) to make an Optiprep concentration of 22.5%. The 22.5% mixture was place in between 27.5% and 20% Optiprep solution in a centrifugation tube (Berkman Coulter, 343778) and centrifuged for 1.5 hours at 100,000xg (Optima MAX Ultracentrifuge, TLA 120.2 rotor, Berkman Coulter). The top layers of 20% and 22.5% and the interface at the 22.5%/27.5% was aspirated off. The bottom layer containing the peroxisome fraction was collected and placed on ice for single organelle sorting.

For separation of different age classes of peroxisomes, the peroxisome fraction was sorted on a BD FACSAria Fusion Flow Cytometer with a 70um nozzle, 1.0xND filer. SNAP-Cell Sir-647, SNAP-Cell TMR Star and MitoTracker Green were detected with APC, PE and FITC channels respectively. APC and PE channels (for detecting old and young peroxisomes) were used for setting the thresholds at 500. The sorting was done with BD FACSDiva software and data analysis was done with the same software or with FlowJo V10.

Peroxisomes were FACS sorted into peroxisome extract buffer supplemented with 1x protease inhibitor (Halt™ Protease Inhibitor, Thermo Scientific, 78446). Sorted peroxisomes were pelleted at 27,000 xgfor 25 minutes at 4oC. The pellets were lysed with RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH7.5, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 % triton X100) supplemented with protease inhibitor (Halt™ Protease Inhibitor, Thermo Scientific, 78446) and phosphatase inhibitors (PhosSTOP, Merck, 4906845001) and stored at -80oC for proteomic analysis or western blotting.

Sorted peroxisome samples were sonicated for 20 minutes (20 cycles: 30 s ON, 30 s OFF; Bioruptor, Diagenode), and centrifuged at 14,000 xgfor 30 minutes at 4 °C and supernatants were collected. Protein concentration was measured by bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo-Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Around 10 µg of protein was digested as in previously described protocols54. Briefly, proteins were precipitated in cold methanol, incubated at -20 °C for 2 hours, centrifuged at 14,000 xgfor 20 minutes at 4 °C, and supernatants were discarded. Protein pellets were re-suspended in 100 mM Tris buffer containing 100 mM dithiothreitol and 4% w/V sodium-dodecyl-sulfate (pH 8.0), heated at 95 °C for 30 minutes under mild agitation, and diluted with 8 M urea in 100 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0). Samples were loaded on 30 KDa molecular filters (Millipore) and centrifuged at 14,000 xgfor 20 minutes. Filters were washed twice with 8 M urea buffer, incubated in 50 mM iodoacetamide in 8 M urea buffer for 30 minutes (in the dark), and washed 4 times (2x 8 M urea buffer, 2x 50 mM tri-ethyl-ammonium bicarbonate buffer pH 8.0). Proteins were then digested using trypsin (enzyme-protein ratio 1:50) at 37 °C for 16 hours at 650RPM. After digestion, filters were centrifuged at 14,000 xgfor 20 minutes to extract tryptic peptides.

Peptide mixtures were desalted and cleared of residual contaminants by sequential solid phase extraction. First, samples were loaded on primed (priming wash sequence: methanol, 80% acetonitrile (ACN) and 0.5% acetic acid in water, 0.5% acetic acid in water) C18 tips (Sigma), washed with 100 µl of 0.5% acetic acid in ultrapure water, and eluted in 0.5% acetic acid and 80% ACN in ultrapure water. Eluates were dried in a vacuum concentrator. Second, eluates were dried and subjected to SP3 peptide purification55. A volume of 2 µl of SP3 beads (1:1 ratio of Sera Mag A and Sera Mag B re-suspended in ultrapure water; Sigma) was added to dried peptides and incubated for 2 minutes under gentle agitation. A volume of 200 µl of ACN was then added and samples were incubated for 10 minutes. This step was repeated twice. Peptides were eluted from beads by adding 200 µl of 2% dimethyl sulfoxide in water and sonicating mixtures for 1 minute. Supernatants were then collected, dried, and stored at -80 °C until MS analysis.

MS analysis was performed on a Q-Exactive HF-X (Thermo-Fisher) mass spectrometer. Around 1 µg of tryptic peptides was separated on a RP-HPLC EasySpray column (ID 75 µm × 25 cm C18 2 µm 100 Å resin; Thermo-Fisher) coupled to a nano-LC EASY 1200 chromatography system (Thermo-Fisher). Peptides were first trapped on an Acclaim PepMap™ 100 pre-column (ID 75 µm × 2 cm C18 3 µm, 100 Å resin; Thermo-Fisher), then separated on a reverse phase HPLC EasySpray column (ID 75 µm × 50 cm C18 2 µm, 100 Å resin; Thermo-Fisher). Chromatographic gradient was run at a flow of 350 nl/min with the following steps: 10-30% B in 90 minutes; 30-45%B in 20 minutes; 45-95% B in 1 minute; 95%B for 9.5 minutes. Full MS scan parameters: 60,000 resolution, AGC target was set to 3E6. MS/MS scan parameters: 15,000 resolution, AGC target was set to 1E5. Collision energy was set to 28, n of analyzed peaks was set to 15. Dynamic exclusion window was set to 10 s.

MS analysis-derived RAW files were searched using the Andromeda56search engine as part of the MaxQuant57software suite (v1.6.14.0). Spectra were searched against the Uniprot-Swissprot human proteome database (version download: 2020.02.24). Trypsin was selected as protease for in silico digestion. Carbamidomethylation of Cysteine residues was selected as fixed modification, while Methionine oxidation and acetylation of N-terminal residues were selected as variable ones. Label-free Quantification (LFQ)58was activated to allow accurate evaluation of protein abundance. Identification of peptides resulting from missed cleavages was allowed. Precursor ion tolerance was set to 20 and 4.5 ppm for first and main searches, respectively. Match-between-runs option was enabled, and settings left to default. The protein intensity table resulting from the search was filtered for protein q-value (<0.01), contaminant (excluded), reverse sequences (excluded), and unique peptides (at least 1). Protein table was imported in R (v3.6), filtered for missing values (at least 50% observations in one sample group) and Log2transformed. Residual missing observations were imputed with 0 prior centering and scaling the dataset.

Cell or peroxisome samples were lysed with RIPA buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (as above). Samples were vortexed or sonicated (5 cycles: 30 s on, 30 s off, at 4oC in a Bioruptor sonicator) and centrifuged at 13,000xg for 20 minutes and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentrations were measured using Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, 5000001) or Pierce BCA Protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23225).

Western blots were run with the Bolt system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Proteins were denatured by adding Bolt LDS sample buffer (B0007) and sample reducing agent (B0009), heating to 95oC for 3-5 minutes followed by placing samples on ice immediately. Samples were run on Bolt 4-12% Bis-Tris Gels (NW04120BOX) in Bolt MES SDS running buffer (B0002) and resolved proteins were transferred to 0.2 µM nitrocellulose membrane with Bolt transfer buffer (BT00061) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

Membranes were incubated in blocking buffer (5% skim milk, 0.1% Tween-20 in TBS) for 1 hour at RT followed by incubation with primary antibodies in blocking buffer overnight at 4oC. Membranes were washed with blocking buffer, incubated with HRP conjugated secondary antibodies in blocking buffer for 1 hour at RT and washed with 0.1% Tween-20 in TBS. Proteins were detected using Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10005943) or SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Scientific, 34094) and Fujifilm Super RX films (FUJRX18 × 24) or ChemiDoc MP (Bio-Rad).

Primary antibodies were mouse monoclonal anti-PMP70 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, SAB4200181,1:800); rabbit anti-catalase antibody (D4P7B) (Cell Signaling Technology, 12980; 1:500); mouse a-tubulin (DM1A) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, 3873, 1:1000); anti-SNAP-tag antibody (New England BioLabs, P9310S; 1:1,000); anti-beta Actin antibody (Abcam, ab8227, 1:2,000); Anti-UQCRFS1 [EPR16288] (Abcam, ab191078, rabbit, 1:1,000); anti-LAMP1 antibody (Abcam, ab24170, 1:1,000); Calnexin polyclonal antibody (Enzo, ADI-SPA-860, 1:1,000), anti-Glucose 6 Phosphate Dehydrogenase antibody (Abcam, ab133525, 1:200).

Secondary antibodies were anti-mouse IgG HRP-linked antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, 7076S, 1:1,000) or anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, A0545, 1:1000-3000).

Analyze Gels function of Fiji ImageJ software59was used for Western blots quantification. Protein level was calculated against housekeeping proteins α-tubulin or β-actin.

50000 hMECs were sorted using FACS and resuspended in assay medium (glucose-, pyruvate- and glutamine-free DMEM (Agilent, 103334-100) supplemented with MEGM supplements (Lonza, CC-3150) and 8 mM 1,2-13 C glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, CLM-504-0.25). Cells were immediately seeded on 48 well plates in a total volume of 200 µl. Samples of 5 µl medium were collected 0 and 1 hour later in 95 µl ice cold 80% acetonitrile and stored at -80C until analysis.

All samples were analyzed on a Thermo Q Exactive Focus Quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer coupled with a Thermo Dionex UltiMate 3000 HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The HPLC was equipped with a hydrophilic ZIC-pHILIC column (150 × 2.1 mm, 5 μm) with a ZIC-pHILIC guard column (20 × 2.1 mm, 5 μm, Merck Sequant). 5ul of the samples were injected into the LC-MS after quality controls in randomized order having every 10th samples as blank. The separation was achieved by applying a linear solvent gradient in decreasing organic solvent (80–35%, 16 min) at 0.15 ml/min flow rate and 45 °C column oven temperature. The mobile phases were following, aqueous 200 mmol/l ammonium bicarbonate solution (pH 9.3, adjusted with 25% ammonium hydroxide), 100% acetonitrile and 100% water. The amount of the ammonium bicarbonate solution was kept at 10% throughout the run resulting in steady 20 mmol/l concentration. Metabolites were analyzed using a MS equipped with a heated electrospray ionization (H-ESI) source using polarity switching and following setting: resolution of 70,000 at m/z of 200, the spray voltages: 3400 V for positive and 3000 V for negative mode, the sheath gas: 28 arbitrary units (AU), and the auxiliary gas: 8 AU, the temperature of the vaporizer: 280 °C, temperature of the ion transfer tube: 300 °C. Instrument control was conducted with the Xcalibur 4.1.31.9 software (Thermo Scientific). The peaks for metabolites were confirmed using commercial standards (Sigma etc). Data quality was monitored throughout the run using inhouse quality control cell line extracted in a same way as unknown samples and blank as every 10th sample. The final peak integration was done with the TraceFinder 4.1 SP2 software (Thermo Scientific) and for further data analysis, the peak area data was exported as an excel file. The ratio of M + 1 to M + 2 lactate was calculated from the peak areas.

Lipids were extracted from cell pellets (at least from one million cells) according to Folch et al.60and dissolved in chloroform/methanol 1:2 (v/v). Internal standards [EquiSPLASH® internal standard mixture and Ceramide (Cer) 18:1;O2/17:0, both from Merck] were added and samples were analyzed with LC-MS/MS as described before61. The method used acetonitrile/water/isopropanol-based solvent system62, Agilent 1290 Infinity HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) equipped with a Luna Omega C18 100 Å (50 × 2.1 mm, 1.6 μm) column (Phenomenex) and Agilent 6490 Triple Quad LC/MS with iFunnel Technology. The lipids species were identified and quantified using lipid class-specific precursor ion and neutral loss detection modes, as previously described61. Additionally, PE plasmalogens (PE P) were identified with alkenyl chain (16:0, 18:0, 18:1)-specific scans as described previously63and quantified from MS- scan. Mass spectra were processed using MassHunter Qualitative Navigator software (Agilent) and lipid species were quantified utilizing the internal and additional external standards (glucosylceramide 18:1;O2/24:1) and LIMSA software64. Lipid data are expressed as molar percentages (mol%) and lipid species are marked as follows: [sum of acyl chain carbons]: [sum of acyl chain double bonds] (e.g., PC 36:1).

Fatty acyl (FA) and alkenyl chains, and fatty alcohols (FOHs) were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) following previously published procedures65–67.One half of the Folch-extract of the cell pellet was evaporated near to dryness under nitrogen flow and the extracted lipids were transmethylated by heating with 1% H2SO4 in methanol under nitrogen atmosphere, which converts FAs to their methyl esters, phospholipid-derived alkenyl chains to dimethyl acetals (DMAs) and leaves FOHs intact. After adding water, the FAs, DMAs and FOHs were extracted with hexane, and the sample solution was dried, and concentrated. These samples were then injected into a GC-2010 Plus gas chromatograph (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Kyoto, Japan) with flame-ionization detector for quantification of the analytes, and their identification was performed using a GCMS-QP2010 Ultra (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Kyoto, Japan) with mass selective detector (MSD). Both systems were equipped with Zebron ZB-wax capillary columns (30 m, 0.25 mm ID and film thickness 0.25 μm; Phenomenex, Torrence CA, USA). The compositions of the lipid-derived FAs and DMAs were expressed as mol% profiles, and the FOHs were calculated as µmol/106cells.

Asymmetric inheritance of peroxisomes in division pairs was quantified using Fiji ImageJ software. All the stacks were z-projected with sum intensity. Cell borders were identified using bright filed (cells in 2D culture) or E-cadherin/ α-tubulin (EpSC). Total intensity of old or young peroxisomes in two daughter cells was considered 100%.

For colocalization analysis of G6PD with peroxisomes Imaris x64 software was used. Peroxisomes were identified using the Spots creation function based on both old and young peroxisome labeling. Old and young label intensity of each spot was normalized with the median value of each channel and the old/young ratio was calculated based on the normalized value. Total peroxisome number of each cell was divided equally into 3 different groups: old, double positive, and young peroxisomes based on old/young ratio ranking: i.e., one third of peroxisomes with highest old/young ratio was classified as old peroxisomes, one third of peroxisomes with lowest old/young ratio was classified as young peroxisomes, and the rest was double positive peroxisomes. G6PD was identified using the spot creation function. Colocalization of G6PD and peroxisomes was analyzed using the Colocalize spots function (extension of Imaris x64 software) with the distance between center of 2 spots set at 0.5 µm. Colocalized peroxisomes were classified into different age groups of peroxisomes based on their old/young ratio and their fraction of colocalization with G6PD was quantified.

Two-tailed Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA were used to compare groups otherwise indicated separately, andp< 0.05 was considered significant. The statistical analysis of RNA sequencing and mass spectrophotometry is described above. Microsoft Excel (Office 16) or GraphPad Prism 8 were used for statistical analysis.

No statistical method was used to predetermine the sample size. No data were excluded from the analyses. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.
