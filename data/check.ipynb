FCP training requirements are outlined in The Roadmap to Practice (RTP), which includes clinical supervision.\n\nIn this qualitative study, 12 musculoskeletal FCPs who had completed FCP training at a specific English university participated in semi‐structured interviews that explored their clinical supervision in primary care.\n\nThematic analysis identified three themes: operational factors, the role of personal and professional identity and the dynamics of learning. Participants reported variation in support and organisation provided in their places of work and the impact on their learning; specific barriers related to employment contracts were highlighted. Participants reflected on personal and professional factors that were inconsistently addressed, including cultural competence and the relevance of neurodiversity for both patients and professionals. Positive elements were raised relating to learning dynamics, including accessing supervision from more than one individual and representatives from more than one profession. The bidirectional learning opportunities offered from clinical supervision were highlighted, including supervisors who are not musculoskeletal specialists accessing musculoskeletal expertise from their mentees and the FCPs benefitting from supervisors who have extensive experience of managing complex consultations in primary care.\n\nClinical supervision experiences of FCPs in this study were typically positive. High‐quality supervision is dependent on stakeholders fully understanding the role and is optimised by multi‐professional involvement. Future studies could include evaluation of referral patterns and clinical outcomes of FCPs from varying employment frameworks.\n\nKeywords:clinical mentorship, clinical supervision, first contact physiotherapist, first contact practitioner, musculoskeletal, professional identity\n\nMusculoskeletal First Contact Practitioners (FCPs) are ‘physiotherapists who are able to assess, diagnose, treat, and discharge without medical input, and they are competent at managing the full spectrum of musculoskeletal patients’ (Stynes et al.2020, 3). Musculoskeletal conditions constitute up to 30% of primary care consultations in England (NHS England (a),n.d.) where the FCP role supports General Practitioners (GPs) with this caseload, aiming to optimise patient care by ensuring appropriate expertise at the start of patient pathways (HEE/NHSE2021). Studies demonstrate that FCPs provide safe, clinically effective, cost‐beneficial care with high levels of patient satisfaction (Walsh et al.2024; Goodwin et al.2021; Wood et al.2022).\n\nHealth Education England (HEE) (known now as NHSEngland [NHSE]) published the Musculoskeletal FCP ‘Roadmap To Practice’ (RTP) (HEE/NHSE2021), that defines the FCP role, entry criteria, education, training processes and required capabilities, building upon the Musculoskeletal Core Capabilities Framework (HEE/NHSE2018). Training was initially evidenced via an independent ‘portfolio route’ or ‘taught higher education’ route; this was amended in 2024 so that higher education institutions now guide and support both routes. A study exploring experiences of FCPs navigating the ‘independent portfolio route’ concluded that the volume of evidence required and limited guidance was overwhelming for many, particularly novice FCPs who expressed preference for a higher education route (Carus et al.2023).\n\nClinical supervision is detailed as an integral component of the RTP (HEE/NHSE2021); however, challenges to accessing quality supervision have been previously identified in those undertaking the independent ‘portfolio route’ (Millington et al.2024). This study explores the lived experiences of FCPs undergoing clinical supervision as part of the ‘taught route’ for fulfilment of the RTP. This study aims to:\n\nExplore elements associated with FCP clinical supervision, including logistics, clinicians involved, common areas of practice development and the impact of this training requirement.\n\nInvestigate the facilitators and barriers to effective supervision.\n\nSupport the development of supervision models for FCPs.\n\nA qualitative design was chosen applying an interpretivist approach underpinned by constructivism (Bryman2021). This approach enables inductive analysis of data from a small number of participants with detailed exploration of individuals' experiences. The researcher assumes a central role by intuitively examining emerging meanings whilst looking for deeper interpretation. Researchers achieve this by engaging participants using personal knowledge and experience whilst undertaking personal reflexivity during the research process (Ayton et al.2024; Braun and Clarke2022).\n\nThe research team consisted of academics and physiotherapists experienced in FCP education, its governance framework and the clinical role. The interviewer (S.G.) possessed a shared academic and clinical (FCP) role and had previously completed the RTP requirements. A purposive recruitment strategy was followed; participants invited (via email) had all completed the clinical requirements of the RTP via a higher education route at the researchers' workplace. For this particular university module, eligible clinicians are fully qualified physiotherapists employed in the musculoskeletal FCP role and supported by at least 1 ‘clinical mentor’, a suitably qualified physiotherapist and/or General Practitioner (GP). Students may access support from more than one mentor. The term ‘clinical mentor’ is used for this module; other institutions may use the term ‘supervisor’.\n\nParticipants represented a breadth of experience and demographics including diverse UK geographical locations (Table1). Twelve participants were interviewed, enabling a thorough exploration of the topic, collection of manageable data quantity and evidence of data saturation. Similar studies within the field had a comparable sample size (Bassett and Jackson2022; Carus et al.2023).\n\nParticipant demographics.\n\nNHS Lothian is in Scotland where there is equivalent to an FCP role; however, the musculoskeletal RTP and funding for FCPs under the Additional Roles scheme is only within NHS England (NHSE).\n\nA semi‐structured interview guide to explore FCP's clinical supervision experiences was created by the research team. This design process was informed by key methodological principles including the need to ensure clarity of intent, enable participant honesty and optimise responses directly related to the research aims (Robson and McCartan2016). As the research team included clinicians employed as FCPs, interview piloting within the team enabled question refinement, clarification of prompt usage and development of an interview topic guide (Appendix1). Semi‐structured interviews (lasting 45–60 min) were conducted with consenting participants via the digital platform, ‘Zoom Workplace’ (Version 6.1.6). Interviews were recorded, anonymised for data analysis and reporting and transcribed. The interviewer had no previous relationship with the participants. Transcription, coding, analysis and reporting of findings were undertaken by team members (P.N. and S.I.), who hold academic and clinical roles. Two participants undertook data verification, and one minor amendment was made to maximise anonymity.\n\nThematic analysis was guided using Braun and Clarke's six phase approach (Braun and Clarke2022) and the NVivo qualitative software programme (Version 14) utilised. Codes were initially generated by one researcher (P.N.) who had undertaken transcription; these were verified by a second researcher (S.I.) and participant (F.B.). Inter‐coder reliability was established, ensuring that groupings of data were consistent, illustrative of the raw data and the trustworthiness of data analysis could be evidenced (Castleberry and Nolen2018). The analysis was inductive without prior identification of concepts or theories to test or explore. Initial coding provided evidence of data saturation as few new codes were required for the final interviews—markers of data saturation were verified by the participant checker. Secondary coding followed and then development of subcategories, categories and final themes.\n\nEthical approval for this study was granted by the University of Essex, School of Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercises Faculty Ethics Sub‐Committee (Reference: ETH‐2324‐0690).\n\nParticipant demographics are detailed in Table1, and all possessed the minimum experience requirements (5 years post‐qualification with 3 years musculoskeletal experience) as set out by NHSE, ranging from 6 to 21 years post‐qualification experience. Participants had been employed as an FCP between 6 months and 3 years. There was an even distribution of role banding between 7 and 8a (Agenda for Change or equivalent), the recommended standard for this role (CSP2018; HEE/NHSE2021). Geographical locations of participants varied throughout England; one participant was based in Scotland where FCP equivalent roles exist; however, the musculoskeletal RTP and funding for FCPs under the Additional Roles Reimbursement Scheme (ARRS) only apply within England. Professional diversity was seen among mentors.\n\nTable2summarises the coding framework. Three themes were identified for review and discussion: operational factors, the role of personal and professional identity, and dynamics of learning. Examples of quotations from participants have been included to support the presentation of themes.\n\nData analysis: Coding framework.\n\nParticipants reported that their clinical supervision was affected by factors related to the supervision environment, most notably the connections between primary and secondary care services. The category, ‘Service Connections’ was formed by contributions from several participants who highlighted the need for knowledge of services beyond primary care. Value was placed on accessibility of contacts and services in secondary care. Participants who were employed in a split role between primary and secondary care and were familiar with the processes, pathways and contacts in each clinical environment emphasised this advantage.\n\nIn my trust, our band sevens are normally a blended role; it's good because it means that the system is very joined up. So, when I refer into orthopaedics, I know those people, I can talk to them about what I need to do to refer, or is this appropriate? It's all very joined up, which I think is often not the case when people just work in FCP because they're a bit sort of marooned.\n\n(P8)\n\nParticipants who were only employed in primary care explored the complexities of developing these service connections and found that a small number had managed to access time in secondary care as part of their FCP clinical learning experience.\n\n…. the value of observing practitioners in secondary as well as primary care, because I suppose that's half the job; referring on and knowing if you're referring on appropriately, things to look out for, that kind of thing.\n\n(P5)\n\nResource availability was the second category of this theme; variation was found between participants. Some were provided with accessible clinical supervision in their own place of work, the organisation was supported by service colleagues and time was allocated.\n\nThe PCN were aware that we were both doing the Roadmap…so when it became obvious that we'd blocked an afternoon to do it together, there were no questions asked. They were supportive.\n\n(P10)\n\nOthers reported challenges in accessing the resources required to complete this compulsory activity. Whilst accepting personal responsibility for scheduling supervision, some had to address contractual considerations. A participant employed by an NHS Trust and then working for part of their role in primary care explored this complexity:\n\nThe PCN clinical leads felt that the element of supervision required formally should fall on the time of the hospital Trust; they were employing the Trust to provide a FCP service and felt that it was the time and responsibility of the hospital Trust to provide that supervision and not for them.\n\n(P4)\n\nAnother explained that their employer support was restricted and contractual complexities resulted in them completing the clinical supervision in their own time and unpaid.\n\nIt wasn't part of my normal working hours, so it was in addition to my normal work. From a financial point of view as well, it was something that I had to do myself; it wasn't paid work.\n\n(P9)\n\nThe volume of material related to individual participant's personal characteristics and the relevance of these was noteworthy. Participants reported that, as clinicians, their own cultural background, personal and professional identity influenced their clinical role and patient interactions.\n\nI was based in a very rural, middle to upper class, white, Caucasian area; a small village. Everyone's very well‐to‐do. So I was the only person of colour there… Understanding of different cultures isn’t there yet, which can act as a barrier.\n\n(P2)\n\nA participant who had trained as a physiotherapist outside the UK explained how their lack of familiarity with the UK system presented some specific learning needs.\n\nI sat in with a lot of people because when I started, I was only four months into the FCP role, so I really wanted to understand the system, because again, I'm not from the system. I didn't grow up in the system.\n\n(P3)\n\nSome participants extended the discussion to include how their clinical learning needed to acknowledge and be responsive to patients' individual features, including their cultural backgrounds.\n\nMy FCP mentor did point out a couple of bits about ethnic minority patients, which were useful. I think they were in the back of my mind. Indian patients having a higher prevalence for diabetes, for example.\n\n(P1)\n\nParticipants raised the significance of neurodiversity both for themselves as students but also the need to identify and acknowledge relevant neurodiversity issues with patients. As a dyslexic, one participant highlighted that the university route to meeting the RTP's requirements provided more guidance and structure to alternative routes.\n\nBeing dyslexic and also struggling with …. what I was doing, …. I thought I just need to go down the university route and get guidance on how to do the task.\n\n(P12)\n\nOthers commented that in relation to patients' neurodiversity needs, formal training was limited but as clinicians in primary care, they wanted to offer individualised and responsive patient consultations.\n\nIn response to neurodiversity; trying to make reasonable adjustments, trying to ensure that contact with that patient is approachable and as beneficial for them as can be.\n\n(P7)\n\nProfessional identity was a topic that participants drew on as they explored settling into and developing the FCP role. Participants reported a widespread lack of role understanding, commenting that they were regularly confused for ‘in‐house’ physiotherapists offering treatment and rehabilitation and several highlighted that many patient consultations were not first contact. The opportunities linked to this relatively new role were discussed by some, who were keen to highlight innovation, good practice and the impact of FCPs they respected. Topics explored included the FCP's ‘position in the team’, (P7), the value of professional specialisation in primary care ‘how much I love being a (musculoskeletal) physio and not having the pressure(of other specialisms)’, (P2) and the potential to ‘make your own path as an FCP’, (P8). As participants explored their professional identity, they made references to the scope of practice and associated complexities. Several noted that whilst additional skills could be acquired and brought into the FCP clinic e.g. injection therapy and independent prescribing, navigating skill integration had to be carefully considered.\n\nMy GP is really supportive of me increasing scope of practice and being able to do that. There's always that potential fear of ‘treading on toes,’ and not taking away from what the GP's do. There's a lot in the world of social media about the role of physician associates and what their scope of practice is. As a physio, you feel where does that scope of practice start and end? Where does it cross over into GP territory?\n\n(P4)\n\nThe nuances of professional identification as a musculoskeletal FCP were noted by all; individual, service wide and national considerations were reported with a consensus that role identity was not interpreted in a standard way. One participant had used the university's coursework to explore this topic in detail:\n\nI did my service evaluation piece (module assessment) on the understanding of our role, our professional identity.\n\n(P11)\n\nParticipants all discussed factors relating to the dynamics of learning, theme categories were: impact of directed learning, influence of mentorship relationship, effectiveness of mentorship and bidirectional learning. Participants reflected strong and positive opinions relating to the value of clear direction and guidance provided by the university.\n\n…everything was very clear about what was expected.\n\n(P3)\n\nTwo commonly reported findings related to the clinical mentor's role and impact. Participants reflected positively that the clinical mentor did not complete the formal module assessment—this was the university's responsibility. The clinical mentor's role was to facilitate clinical reasoning, reflection and learning in the clinical environment:\n\nIt was a positive in the fact that their focus wasn’t on the marking side of things, it was more on giving me that feedback on practice only.\n\n(P7)\n\nI think that my mentor not grading me probably made me more relaxed in terms of being able to have open discussions, and being more of a learning process, rather than an assessment process.\n\n(P5)\n\nThe second commonly reported opinion was the value of accessing more than one mentor and the acknowledgement that different individuals will support different practice elements.\n\nI draw on experience of a variety of members of the primary care team and also secondary care as well. So, I had a good, varied experience with different professionals.\n\n(P1)\n\nAccessing professionally diverse team members throughout the learning experience was regarded positively:\n\nI sat in with as many people as I could…… they were really good. The pharmacists and the wellbeing coach and the social prescribers, they were very on board and understanding.\n\n(P11)\n\nSo I suppose we've all got different strings to our bow and things that we’re good at. Someone supervised me who was a very good communicator; very empathetic approach, shared decision making. So I learnt a lot from her and then another person is really into green prescribing, I learnt a lot about local resources and projects.\n\n(P5)\n\nParticipants reflected on their clinical learning and shared positive experiences that they felt had enhanced their practice.\n\nThe GP's were very refined and to the point with their agenda setting and gaining the patients ideas and expectations specifically, so I think that fed in really nicely to my own practice.\n\n(P7)\n\nReducing and making my history maybe a little bit more concise, making my questioning a bit more concise. Talking less.\n\n(P11)\n\nSo, there was a lot of chronic pain. There was a lot of cases of mental health issues and people with financial issues.\n\n(P9)\n\nA small number of negative experiences were shared when participants did not feel a link between their personal development needs and the mentorship.\n\nThere were a few times when he did jump in and start talking… and it becomes a dialogue between the patient and the person observing.\n\n(P10)\n\nSeveral participants explored the impact of the mentorship activity beyond their own learning noting mentors appeared to have benefited from the experience. For some, it had been an opportunity for the development of professional relationships as mentors and mentees had learnt from each other.\n\nHe said I was the first person that really challenged him, but that's a good thing.\n\n(P2)\n\nMy mentor was incredibly supportive of the FCP role and very much recognised the value of having an expert musculoskeletal opinion within the clinic and wanted to learn from me as well.\n\n(P4)\n\nParticipants made links between the lack of formal assessment undertaken by the mentor and patients' perceptions of the process. Reflecting on discussions had with mentors and the fact that bidirectional learning sometimes took place, the patients' reactions were generally positive:\n\nI'd have discussions in front of patients with my mentor, the patients were always happy and consented, and they quite enjoyed being talked about.\n\n(P6)\n\nI never got the impression that people thought that I was being mentored, it was more just a collaborative approach. I introduced it (supervision) as a routine thing, that everyone should be doing as part of normal practice.\n\n(P5)\n\nThis study aimed to understand key elements of clinical supervision, explore associated facilitators and barriers and support the development of supervision models for FCP's. These will be discussed alongside the three themes emerging from the data.\n\nThis review highlights the challenges of FCPs with navigating referral systems across both primary and secondary care. The role of FCP's as gatekeepers for secondary care referral has been a key aim of FCP provision (Goodwin et al.2021; Greenhalgh et al.2020; CSP,2018). The CSP (2018) has previously documented that FCPs are better integrated across musculoskeletal pathways with dual roles in primary and secondary care than those who are employed by the incumbent musculoskeletal provider. Being able to identify and streamline appropriate patients quickly and efficiently is seen as pivotal for practicing clinicians (NHS England2019). A lack of clear referral pathways has been highlighted previously (Baird et al.2022) and FCP's working within ARRS roles may struggle to navigate the healthcare system if clear referral pathways to secondary or specialised care are not established. This study highlights the requirement for stakeholders in clinical practice to enable and operationalise appropriate protocols and policies. These should enable FCP's to escalate cases or refer patients to specialists when needed.\n\nThis review highlighted that whilst supervision is an essential component of the RTP to ensure safe and effective patient care, clinicians faced challenges accessing supervision and aligned with other studies (Baird et al.2022; Nozedar and O’Shea2023; Ingram et al.2023). Barriers including limited supervisors/mentors, time constraints, unclear expectations, workload and resource strain have been identified as previous obstacles (Baird et al.2022). Time constraints and pressures are major factors contributing to supervision difficulties in busy primary care settings (Baird et al.2022; Nozedar and O’Shea2023). Having access to regular, high‐quality supervision maybe challenging for clinicians juggling clinical and administrative responsibilities, but the need for non‐patient contact time has been recommended (Nozedar and O’Shea2023).\n\nThe organisation and procurement of supervision is likely to be underpinned by stakeholder relationships, funding arrangements and administrative support. This review highlighted a lack of organisation and contractual impacts as barriers. FCP's and their supervisors are likely to require administrative support to ensure that supervision is properly documented and feedback provided. Without support, the supervision process may become cumbersome or neglected, perpetuating clinical uncertainty, feelings of stress, and clinical burnout (Ingram et al.2023; Danczak and Lea2017). Contractual arrangements without supervisory detail or funding agreements within current ARRs roles have been highlighted by previous reviews (MacConnachie2024; Baird et al.2022; Bramwell et al.2024; Millington et al.2024). Funding to cover time required for supervision sessions, and additional administrative support should be considered by stakeholders in future provision.\n\nAdditional implications for clinical practice relate to acknowledging the need for psychological and operational support relating to supervision. Enabling FCP wellbeing by ensuring support is available for these clinicians who may experience elevated levels of stress, burnout or fatigue (Nozedar and O’Shea2023; Thompson et al.2024; Welford2018; Ingram et al.2023; Venturini et al.2024) is a consideration of current and future stakeholders.\n\nThe cultural backgrounds of clinicians and patients were identified in this research as impacting learning and practice. Challenges of FCPs working with ethnically diverse populations and the impact of health beliefs have been previously identified by Greenhalgh et al. (2020) leading to recommendations for cultural competence training. Addressing cultural competence more fully within FCP teaching, clinical supervision, and in future iterations of the RTP is recommended and could significantly improve FCP job satisfaction, patient outcomes and experiences (Kumar et al.2019; Oelke et al.2013).\n\nThe impact and challenges of neurodiversity were raised both from a student and patient perspective. The challenges and positive aspects of neurodiversity for healthcare clinicians have been well documented (Butler2024; Crouch2019). With the completion of the RTP being essential for an FCP role, this research suggests that neurodiverse students' needs may be best met in a HEI taught route. The collaborative learning environment created by studying with others offers belonging, support, community, diversity of thinking, understanding and emotional support that can assist with confidence for neurodiverse clinicians (Butler2024; Robinson2022). Future modifications to the RTP content and options for completion should consider neurodiversity more fully to improve accessibility.\n\nWhilst challenges of access to healthcare for people with learning disabilities are well recognised (Alborz et al.2005), there is a desire from FCP clinicians to be responsive to the needs of individual patient's neurodiversity needs. The introduction of The Oliver McGowan Mandatory Training on Learning Disability and Autism (NHS England (b),n.d.) may have raised awareness of this topic, but its effectiveness or impact on patient experience has not been measured. Gaps in the current evidence‐base present an opportunity for future high‐quality research related to delivering patient‐centred care for all (HEE/NHSE2017).\n\nProfessional identity concerns were highlighted in the early stages of the development of the FCP role (Greenhalgh et al.2020; Morris et al.2021, Wood et al.2022) and have been identified by other professional groups integrating into primary care (Jorgenson et al.2014). Nearly 5 years after the launch of the RTP, professional identity remains a key theme highlighted by recent research (Ingram et al.2023; Lewis and Gill2023; Lamb et al.2024; Thompson et al.2024) and by all participants in this study with a lack of understanding about the FCP role remaining, and many still being confused for ‘in‐house’ physiotherapists. The benefits of the FCP role for patients are clear (Wood et al.2022), but lack of role understanding may affect patient accessibility to this service, prevent effective utilisation of the extended scope skills many of these clinicians offer and potentially impact clinical supervision strategies.\n\nThe speedy roll out of the role, constraints to support offered from overseeing organisations and the relatively novel nature of physiotherapists being in Primary Care could all contribute to the lack of understanding of the FCP role, but further research and role promotion support is urgently required to maximise the positive impact of this role.\n\nFindings from this review demonstrate the value of having clear direction and guidance provided by a university course. Having a full understanding of what training and supervision is required in a new role is fundamental to the learning process (NHS England2021). RTP documents aimed to establish the capabilities of Allied Health Professions (AHPs) moving into primary care and identify the supervisory support required via either a portfolio or taught university route. However, these roadmaps have been highlighted as being confusing and unclear (Jones et al.2024) and consequently seen as a barrier to completing the portfolio route. The high level of satisfaction with university support identified in this review aligns with previous research identifying the taught route as being a more attractive option (Carus et al.2023).\n\nFindings from this review revealed universal support for formal assessment to be carried out by the university and not the clinical mentor. One supervision element is the completion of paperwork, which is not only time consuming but can also be difficult due to complex marking criteria (Carus et al.2023). Taking away this responsibility protects the mentors' time whilst valuing their contribution to learning through observation, open discussion, and critical feedback. It also challenges the hierarchical relationship of traditional mentoring and allows a more collaborative approach (Teo et al.2024).\n\nAnother aspect of learning emphasised in this study is the benefit of accessing more than one mentor from a range of professions to support different elements of practice. In recent years, it has become increasingly common for supervision to be conducted across disciplines, not just for FCPs but for all medical professionals (Launer2018; NHS England2021; McGuinness and Guerin2024). Some of the benefits include offering different perspectives to practice (Launer2018) and providing a catalyst for new ways of working (Davys et al.2021). This may offer considerable benefits to clinicians such as FCPs, who are moving into new roles and settings (Millington et al.2024). In addition, previous literature has acknowledged ‘supervision fatigue’ with GPs often supervising medical students, foundation doctors, and GP registrars as well as ARRS staff within a practice (NHS East & West Midlands Clinical Senates2025). Therefore, taking a multi‐professional approach to mentoring and supervision is also an effective way of sharing this responsibility.\n\nClinical mentorship is increasingly recognised as a bidirectional process that benefits both mentors and mentees (Burgess et al.2018). Having FCPs with valuable musculoskeletal expertise has been highlighted as an opportunity for other members of the primary care team to upskill in musculoskeletal care (Moffatt et al.2018), and this review further establishes this beneficial relationship. Given the consistent lack of understanding of the role and scope of FCPs (Goodwin et al.2021; Lamb et al.2023), this bidirectional learning also offers an opportunity for other healthcare professionals to gain greater insight and ensure the full potential of FCPs can be realised.\n\nThis study methodology has been optimised through alignment of its key domains: research team and reflexivity, study design, analysis and findings with the COREQ consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (Tong et al.2007). Researchers' reflexivity has been considered; their established understanding of the musculoskeletal FCP role has enabled participant recruitment, high level discussion during interviews, and analysis that was subsequently explored with reference to the contemporary healthcare landscape. Engagement of participants in data checking, analysis and the publication process has further contributed to methodological rigour (Stringer and Aragón2020). Potential bias of the research team must be considered as they were all employed at the university where the participants had completed their FCP training but the strategies outlined above were used to ensure that transparency and credibility have been optimised. Recommendations for future research have been proposed in Table3.\n\nSuggestions for future research.\n\nClinical supervision is a requirement of FCP role training that presents an opportunity for professional development. Its success and impact are dependent on governance structures that support mentor availability and enable engagement with a range of healthcare professionals. The FCP role is not consistently interpreted, and individual clinicians have acknowledged that their personal and professional identities are evolving; factors such as cultural competence and further training relating to neurodiversity should be considered as part of FCP training. Integration of pedagogical principles relating to optimal learning dynamics should be considered when designing and implementing FCP clinical supervision.\n\nSue Innes:conceptualisation, pilot interview, data curation, formal analysis, project administration, writing – original draft, writing – review and editing.Sarah Golding:ethics application, interviewer, methodology, writing – original draft, review and editing.Philip Nardone:data curation.Caroline Kerry:pilot interview, writing – original draft.Anthony Smith:writing – original draft.Sarah‐Jane King:writing – review and editing.Fiona Blackman:data review, and writing the original draft.\n\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\nThe authors would like to thank the participants in this study who offered their time and expertise.\n\nWelcome to this interview and thank you for agreeing to take part in our research study.

In this study, we developed and qualified a rapid and reliable liquid chromatography‐quadrupole time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry (LC‐qTOF‐MS) method for the quantification of MB in mouse plasma and brain samples. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a PolymerX RP‐1 100 Å (50 × 2 mm, 5 μm) column with a mobile phase consisting of water and methanol containing 0.5% difluoroacetic acid, delivered at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. Calibration curves were constructed using quadratic regression (weighted 1/concentration2) over a range of 3.05–2222.22 ng/mL in both matrices. The method was successfully applied to characterize the pharmacokinetics of MB in male ICR mice, revealing a high systemic clearance (65.64 mL/min/kg) and substantial brain penetration, as indicated by a brain‐to‐plasma partition coefficient (Kp,brain) of 23.50 following single intravenous bolus administration. These findings provide critical insights into MB's in vivo behavior and demonstrate the utility of this bioanalytical method for evaluating MB in preclinical studies.\n\nKeywords:brain penetration, difluoroacetic acid, LC‐qTOF‐MS, methylene blue, pharmacokinetics\n\nAlzheimer's disease (ad) is the most common type of dementia, accounting for 60%–80% of all dementia cases (Erkkinen et al.2018). As of 2024, an estimated 6.93 million people in the United States are living withad, and this number is projected to rise to 13.85 million by 2060 (Rajan et al.2021).\n\nThe etiology ofadis complex and multifactorial. Key pathological features include the accumulation of amyloid‐beta plaques and abnormal tau proteins, along with acetylcholine deficiency, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, metal ion imbalance, glutamate dysregulation, insulin resistance, gut microbiota alterations, disrupted cholesterol homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired autophagy (Zhang et al.2024). Among these, the formation of amyloid‐beta plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) is a defining pathological feature ofad(DeTure and Dickson2019). The accumulation of these pathological lesions disrupts neurotransmitter balance and induces neuronal death, ultimately leads to cognitive impairment (Yiannopoulou and Papageorgiou2013). Consequently, therapeutic strategies focused on restoring neurotransmitter homeostasis and preventing or eliminating abnormal protein aggregates remain central toadtreatment efforts.\n\nFDA‐approved drug therapies foradfall into two categories: (1) symptomatic treatments that address neurotransmitter imbalances, including cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) and the N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor antagonist (memantine); and (2) disease‐modifying therapies targeting the underlying pathology, such as anti‐amyloid‐beta antibody therapies (aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab), which bind to amyloid‐beta and promote plaque clearance by microglia (Cummings et al.2024). While neurotransmitter‐modulating drugs alleviate symptoms without affecting disease progression, anti‐amyloid‐beta therapies are limited by adverse effects and modest clinical efficacy. These limitations highlight the need for alternative therapeutic approaches. To address this, recent research has increasingly focused on novel therapeutic strategies that target not only amyloid‐beta but also tau proteins (Jeremic et al.2023).\n\nTau protein plays a crucial role in microtubule assembly and stabilization in normal neurons (Iqbal et al.2010). However, inadpatients, tau undergoes various posttranslational modifications, including hyper‐phosphorylation, acetylation, N‐glycosylation, and truncation, leading to structural misfolding and the formation of aggregates such as tau oligomers, granular tau oligomers, and NFTs. The accumulation of these abnormal tau species contributes to neuronal death (Congdon and Sigurdsson2018; Huang, Neurochemistry Laboratory, and Harvard Medical School2020; Soeda and Takashima2020). Studies suggest that tau oligomers, the precursors to tau filaments, may exhibit greater toxicity inadpatients (Akihiko Takashima2020; Niewiadomska et al.2021; Shafiei et al.2017). Consequently, developing drugs that inhibit tau aggregation or promote its clearance has emerged as a key therapeutic strategy. Among the various tau‐targeting treatments under development, MB stands out as a promising tau aggregation inhibitor (Peng et al.2023; Soeda and Takashima2020).\n\nTo the best of the authors' knowledge, despite growing interest in MB for its tau‐inhibiting effects, no analytical method has been reported for its quantification in the brain. Most existing bioanalytical methods focus solely on MB quantification in plasma or whole blood, leaving a critical gap in understanding its distribution in the central nervous system (Burhenne et al.2008; Kim et al.2014; Rengelshausen et al.2004; Yang et al.2011). In contrast, this study presents a comprehensive bioanalytical method that enables MB quantification not only in plasma but also in brain homogenate. Given MB's potential as a tau aggregation inhibitor, the ability to accurately measure its concentration in the brain is crucial for advancing research on its therapeutic applications inneurodegenerative diseases such asad.\n\nFurthermore, while previous studies have employed various separation techniques for MB quantification, this study is the first to utilize difluoroacetic acid (DFA) as a mobile phase additive in reversed‐phase liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry (RPLC–MS). DFA has been increasingly recognized for its ability to enhance chromatographic performance in reversed‐phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) while minimizing the loss of mass spectrometry sensitivity (Fu et al.2023; Lardeux et al.2021; Nguyen et al.2019). Its incorporation effectively mitigates peak broadening and long run times, common challenges in previous studies, thereby enabling the development of a high‐throughput bioanalytical method with improved resolution and efficiency.\n\nThe optimized method was successfully applied to pharmacokinetic study samples, enabling a comprehensive characterization of MB's pharmacokinetics in ICR mice, including both plasma pharmacokinetics and brain distribution. Moreover, this bioanalytical method is expected to be applicable to MB derivatives and other structurally similar compounds, expanding its potential in bioanalytical research.\n\nMB, verapamil (used as an internal standard, ISTD) and DFA were purchased from Sigma‐Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Liquid chromatography‐grade methanol (MeOH) and distilled water (DW) for sample preparation were obtained from SAMCHUN (Seoul, South Korea), while dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was purchased from DAEJUNG (Siheung, South Korea). Mass spectrometry‐grade formic acid (FA), MeOH, and DW were purchased from Thermo Fisher (Massachusetts, USA).\n\nPooled male ICR mouse plasma in sodium heparin was obtained from Biomedex (Seoul, South Korea). All other reagents were commercially available for bioanalytical use and were used without further purification.\n\nThe analytical system comprised a CTC HTS PAL autosampler (LEAP Technologies, Carrboro, NC, USA), two Shimadzu Prominence LC‐20adpumps, a Shimadzu CBM‐20A HPLC pump controller (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD, USA), and a TripleTOF 5600 quadrupole time‐of‐flight mass spectrometer equipped with a Duospray ion source (Sciex, Foster City, CA, USA).\n\nFor LC separation, the PolymerX RP‐1 100 Å (50 × 2 mm, 5 μm) column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) was used for the separation of MB and its ISTD, verapamil. The injection volume was 7 μL, with the column temperature maintained at 55°C. The mobile phase flow rate was 0.5 mL/min. Mobile phase A consisted of 0.5% (v/v) DFA in DW, while mobile phase B contained 0.5% (v/v) DFA in MeOH. The gradient conditions are detailed in Table1.\n\nMobile phase B (%) in LC gradient elution.\n\nFor mass spectrometry, electrospray ionization in positive mode was used for analyte ionization. Ion source gas 1 and 2 were set at 50 psi, and the curtain gas flow rate was 33 L/min. The ion source temperature was maintained at 500°C, and the ion spray voltage was 5500 V. The mass‐to‐charge (m/z) transitions were as follows: m/z 284.1–268.1 for MB and m/z 455.3–165.1 for verapamil. The declustering potential was set at 100 V for MB and 125 V for verapamil, while the collision energy was 30 V for both compounds.\n\nData acquisition was performed using Analyst TF software (version 1.6), and data processing was conducted with MultiQuant software (version 3.0.3) (Sciex, Foster City, CA, USA).\n\nA 1 mg/mL MB stock solution was prepared in DMSO, along with a 0.1 mg/mL sub‐stock solution, also in DMSO. Both solutions were stored at −20°C until use.\n\nFor the preparation of STD and QC samples, the 0.1 mg/mL sub‐stock solution was serially diluted in DMSO to prepare working solutions. Each working solution was then spiked into blank mouse plasma and blank mouse brain homogenate, followed by the addition of MeOH containing 100 ng/mL of ISTD (verapamil) and 0.1% (v/v) DFA. The final concentrations of the STD samples were 3.05, 9.15, 27.44, 82.31, 246.91, 740.74, and 2222.22 ng/mL in both matrices. The final concentrations of QC samples were 15.03, 165.29, and 1818.18 ng/mL in both matrices.\n\nThe in‐house acceptance criteria for accuracy (relative error, RE, %) and precision (relative standard deviation, RSD, %) of the STD and QC samples were set within ±25%, except for the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) sample, which was within ±30%. These criteria, commonly applied during the drug discovery stage, were adhered to in all quantification and qualification experiments conducted in this study (Bateman et al.2013; Xu et al.2005).\n\nA 20 μL mouse plasma sample was transferred into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and mixed with 100 μL of MeOH containing 100 ng/mL of ISTD (verapamil) and 0.1% (v/v) DFA. The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged at 15,871 rcf for 5 min at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was diluted 1:1 with DW, and a 7 μL aliquot was injected for analysis.\n\nThe mouse brain was weighed, and 1× phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) was added at a volume twice the brain weight, followed by homogenization (resulting in a total threefold dilution). A 30 μL aliquot of the brain homogenate was transferred to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and mixed with 150 μL of MeOH containing 100 ng/mL of ISTD (verapamil) and 0.1% (v/v) DFA. The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged at 15,871 rcf for 5 min at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was diluted 1:1 with DW, and a 7 μL aliquot was injected for analysis.\n\nTo evaluate the robustness and reproducibility of the developed bioanalytical method, linearity, intra‐ and inter‐day accuracy and precision, as well as stability tests, were conducted. Qualification parameters were selected based on a fit‐for‐purpose approach.\n\nSTD samples at seven different concentrations and QC samples at three different concentrations were prepared and analyzed. Calibration curves were constructed by plotting the STD sample concentration as the independent variable (x) and the peak area ratio of the analyte to the ISTD as the dependent variable (y), using quadratic regression (y = ax2+ bx + c) with a weighting factor of 1/x2. Linearity was assessed based on the coefficient of correlation (r), which should be > 0.99.\n\nSelectivity and sensitivity were evaluated using chromatographic peaks of the LLOQ sample and blank samples with or without ISTD (BI or BB) in mouse plasma and brain homogenate.\n\nTo confirm the robustness and reproducibility of the developed bioanalytical method for quantifying MB in mouse plasma and brain homogenate, fresh STD and QC samples were prepared and analyzed over three separate days. The QC concentrations were set at low (15.03 ng/mL), medium (165.29 ng/mL), and high (1818.18 ng/mL).\n\nThe stability of MB in mouse blank plasma and mouse brain homogenate was evaluated under the short‐term (bench‐top), long‐term, and freeze–thaw conditions. QC samples at three concentration levels were subjected to the following conditions; Short‐term stability: incubation at room temperature (RT) for 4 h. Long‐term stability: storage at −80°C for 2 weeks. Freeze–thaw stability: three freeze–thaw cycles between −80°C and RT. Following each storage condition, QC samples were quantified alongside freshly prepared STD samples. Stability was confirmed if the accuracy and precision of QC samples remained within ±25% of the acceptance criteria.\n\nMale ICR mice (7‐weeks old, 30–33 g) were purchased from SAMTAKO (Osan, South Korea) and used for plasma and brain pharmacokinetic studies. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the “Guidelines for the Use of Animals” established by the Chungnam National University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were approved under protocol No. 202404A‐CNU‐071.\n\nMB was dissolved in 100% normal saline and administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg via a single intravenous (IV) bolus injection through the tail vein. Blood samples were collected from the retro‐orbital plexus at 2‐, 5‐, 15‐, 30‐, 60‐, 120‐, 240‐, 480‐, and 1440‐min postdose using heparinized capillary tubes. The collected blood was centrifuged at 15,871 rcf for 5 min at 4°C, and the resulting plasma supernatant was transferred to a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Plasma samples were stored at −80°C until analysis.\n\nTo assess the extent of MB brain distribution, brain and plasma samples were collected at 15, 30, 60 and 120 min following single IV bolus administration at 2 mg/kg. At each designated time point, mice (n= 3 per time point) were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with 20 mL of 1× PBS via cardiac puncture. Brain and plasma samples were then stored at −80°C until analysis.\n\nTheKp,brainvalue was calculated using the following equation (Gupta et al.2006).\n\nwhereAUCbrain,15–120minandAUCplasma,15–120minrepresent the area under the curve of concentration versus time in the brain and plasma, respectively, from 15‐ to 120‐min postdose.\n\nPharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using noncompartmental analysis (NCA) in Phoenix WinNonlin software (version 8.1; Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA).\n\nThe parent ion of MB was detected atm/z284.1, with the most abundant product ion atm/z268.1. The MS/MS spectrum of parent ion and its fragment ions are shown in Figure1.\n\n\n\nMS/MS spectrum of MB with observed mass‐to‐charge ratio and its predicted fragment ions with theoretical mass‐to‐charge ratio.\n\nWhen analyzed using a Phenomenex Kinetex XB‐C18 column (50 × 2.1 mm, 2.6 μm) with 0.1% (v/v) FA in DW/MeOH, poor chromatographic retention was observed (Figure2a). Replacing the Kinetex XB‐C18 column with a PolymerX RP‐1 100 Å column (50 × 2 mm, 5 μm) slightly improved peak shape, but chromatographic retention remained inadequate (Figure2b).\n\n\n\nExtracted ion chromatograms of MB (m/z 284.1 to 268.1) under various conditions following protein precipitation from mouse plasma spiked with MB (1818.18 ng/mL).\n\nTo enhance the interaction between MB and the stationary phase, the mobile phase additive was changed from FA to DFA, leading to a significant improvement in chromatographic performance (Figure2c).\n\nDespite these adjustments, MB peak tailing persisted. To address this issue, the mobile phase flow rate was increased from 0.4 to 0.5 mL/min. Additionally, the DFA concentration was optimized at 0.1%, 0.25%, and 0.5% to refine peak shape. The differences in peak shape at various concentrations of DFA were subtle; 0.5% DFA produced the sharpest and narrowest peaks (Figure3). Consequently, 0.5% DFA was selected for the final experiments. The PolymerX RP‐1 100 Å, capable of withstanding a pH range from 0 to 14, was chosen.\n\n\n\nChromatograms of MB spiked into mouse blank plasma at concentrations of 9.15 ng/mL, using different concentrations of DFA as mobile phase additive in DW and MeOH (mobile phase flow rate: 0.5 mL/min). Panels (a) 0.1% DFA, (b) 0.25% DFA, and (c) 0.5% DFA.\n\nThe calibration curve range was 3.05–2222.22 ng/mL in blank plasma and brain homogenate. The representative regression equations were y = −1.59284e − 7x2+ 0.00341x + 0.01104 (weighting factor: 1/x2,r= 0.99532) in blank plasma and y = −6.00019e − 7x2+ 0.00314x + 0.00336 (weighting factor: 1/x2,r= 0.99643) in blank brain homogenate. The LLOQ was 3.05 ng/mL in mouse plasma and mouse brain homogenate. The representative calibration curve is shown in Figure4.\n\n\n\nRepresentative calibration curve for the quantification of MB in blank mouse plasma (range = 3.05–2222.22 ng/mL andrvalue = 0.99532). The curve range andrvalue in blank mouse brain homogenate were 3.05–2222.22 ng/mL and 0.99643, respectively (data not shown).\n\nFor selectivity and sensitivity evaluation, extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) for MB were analyzed in BI and LLOQ samples (Figure5). Additional data, including EICs of BB, LLOQ, and the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) samples, are provided in (FigureS1). These results confirm the absence of significant matrix effects or ISTD interference and demonstrate sufficient sensitivity for MB quantification.\n\n\n\n(a) Chromatogram of MB at the LLOQ (3.05 ng/mL) spiked in blank mouse plasma and (b) chromatogram of MB at the LLOQ (3.05 ng/mL) in blank mouse brain homogenate.\n\nThe intra‐ and inter‐day accuracy (RE, %) of QC samples at three concentration levels ranged from −14.17% to 13.44% in mouse plasma, and from −10.11% to 2.97% in mouse brain homogenate. The corresponding precision (RSD, %) ranged from 1.63% to 15.92% in mouse plasma and from 2.77% to 8.69% in mouse brain homogenate. These values met the in‐house acceptance criteria, confirming that this method is suitable for reproducible quantification in mouse plasma and brain homogenate (Table2).\n\nThe intra‐ and inter‐day accuracy and precision results in blank mouse plasma.\n\nLow, medium, and high QC samples were stored under various conditions and quantified using a freshly prepared calibration curve. In mouse plasma, the accuracy (RE, %) ranged from −9.55% to 6.32%, and the precision (RSD, %) ranged from 1.26% to 15.01%. In mouse brain homogenate, the accuracy ranged from −22.32% to 2.51%, and the precision ranged from 1.20% to 6.50% (Table3). These values met the in‐house acceptance criteria of ±25%, confirming that MB remains stable for 4 h at RT, 2 weeks at −80°C, and during three repeated freeze–thaw cycles in mouse plasma and brain homogenate.\n\nThe short‐term (bench‐top), long‐term, and freeze–thaw stability results.\n\nThe developed method was applied to quantify MB plasma concentrations following a single IV bolus injection at 2 mg/kg in mice. Figure6presents the plasma concentration‐time profile of MB in male ICR mice, and the corresponding pharmacokinetic parameters are summarized in Table4.\n\n\n\nThe time‐plasma concentration pharmacokinetic profile of MB following a single IV bolus injection at 2 mg/kg in male ICR mice (n= 4).\n\nPharmacokinetic parameters of MB in male ICR mouse after single IV bolus injection at 2 mg/kg.\n\nNote:The time at which the Cmaxis observed (Tmax), observed maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), total drug exposure defined as area under the concentration‐time curve to the last time point (AUClast), total drug exposure defined as area under the concentration‐time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUCinf), systemic clearance (CL), percentage of AUCinfdue to extrapolation from Tlastto infinity (AUCExtrap), and volume of distribution at steady state (Vss).\n\nThe maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) was 617.25 ng/mL, with total drug exposure, defined as the area under the concentration‐time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUCinf), measured at 33,053.20 min*ng/mL. The systemic clearance (CL) was 65.64 mL/min/kg, and the volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) was 26,846.51 mL/kg.\n\nTo characterize MB distribution in brain tissue, time‐concentration profiles in brain and plasma were obtained (Figure7), and theAUCbrain,15–120minandAUCplasma,15–120minwere 106,372.28 and 4,525.58 min*ng/mL, respectively. The resultingKp,brainvalue was 23.50 (Table5), indicating extensive MB distribution in the brain.\n\n\n\nThe time‐concentration profile of MB in brain and plasma following a single IV bolus injection at 2 mg/kg in male ICR mice (n= 3).\n\nThe brain‐to‐plasma partition coefficient (Kp,brain) after single IV bolus injection at 2 mg/kg.\n\nIn this study, we developed and qualified a rapid and reliable bioanalytical method using RPLC–MS for the quantification of MB in mouse plasma and brain samples. The incorporation of DFA as a mobile phase additive enabled efficient MB separation in both matrices, yielding sharp peak shapes and a short run time, making it well‐suited for pharmacokinetic studies.\n\nNotably, the brain penetration of MB was significantly higher than expected, with aKp,brainvalue of 23.50. Although the mechanism underlying this high brain penetration remains unclear, further studies using transporter assay systems are warranted to elucidate the pathways involved.\n\nIn conclusion, the developed method was successfully applied to plasma pharmacokinetic and brain distribution studies in male ICR mice. Beyond MB, this method is expected to be applicable to the analysis of MB analogs and other cationic basic drugs, making it a versatile tool for bioanalytical research.\n\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\nFigure S1.Representative chromatograms of methylene blue spiked into (a–c) mouse blank plasma and (d–f) mouse brain homogenate.

Prehabilitation approaches that address pre‐operative risk factors for chronic post‐surgical pain are a key area for research. To be effective, prehabilitation requires substantial engagement and behaviour change by patients, which can be challenging in the pre‐operative period. Health psychology theory plays a valuable role in understanding how best to support behaviour change to achieve maximum patient benefit. This study provides insights from REST, a pre‐operative sleep intervention for TKR patients.\n\nIn‐depth semi‐structured interviews were conducted with eight TKR patients who took part in the REST feasibility trial. An abductive analysis approach was used to identify the applicability of existing health psychology theories, and to explore new insights into the relationships between stages of behaviour change.\n\nThree thematic areas related to intervention engagement and enactment were identified: (i) health beliefs and readiness to change; (ii) from contemplation to enactment: the role of behaviour change techniques; (iii) and behavioural maintenance.\n\nFindings highlighted three key stages of behaviour change that participants need to be supported in to benefit fully from prehabilitation intervention. Complex behaviour change interventions that include aspects of tailoring should consider the boundaries of acceptable adaption while maintaining core causal mechanisms, and include methods to explore real‐world implementation and usability during the development process. These findings are important for surgeons and multidisciplinary teams to consider when developing new prehabilitation care pathways or when implementing evidence‐based prehabilitation practices.\n\nKeywords:behaviour change, health psychology, joint replacement, orthopaedic, patient experience, prehabilitation, psychology\n\nTotal knee replacement (TKR) is the second most common elective surgical procedure in the UK with approximately 100,000 performed yearly (Registry2022). Internationally, > 1 million operations are performed annually, with rates increasing by 22% between 2009 and 2019 (OECD2021). For many people, TKR is effective as it provides improvements in knee function and pain. However, approximately 10%–34% experience chronic post‐surgical pain (pain lasting for longer than 3‐months) (Beswick et al.2012), leading to dissatisfaction and disappointment (Howells et al.2016; Kim et al.2009). People living with pain after surgery describe difficulties managing work and social life, negative emotional impact, and anxiety and fear around further treatment (Sellevold et al.2023).\n\nThere is a need to develop new approaches to reduce the incidence and severity of chronic pain after TKR. Prehabilitation interventions (pre‐operative rehabilitation) that address pre‐operative risk factors for developing chronic post‐surgical pain are key areas of research need (Almeida et al.2020; Khalid et al.2024; Vervullens et al.2023). The strongest predictor of pain after TKR is pre‐surgical pain (Lewis et al.2015; Sayers et al.2016; Wylde et al.2011): high pre‐operative pain, pain in other bodily locations, and pain catastrophising are all predictive of greater post‐operative pain severity and increased likelihood of developing chronic post‐surgical pain (Sayers et al.2016). Therefore, approaches that target pain before surgery may provide ways to reduce the proportion of people who will experience chronic post‐surgical pain and may reduce the severity for those who do find that they have such pain.\n\nSleep is a known vital component of pain experience: reduced sleep is associated with increased nociceptive and neuropathic pain responses (Finan et al.2013; Haack et al.2007), and improvements to sleep can reduce both immediate and long‐term pain in osteoarthritis (Vitiello et al.2009). Sleep is a substantial issue for people awaiting TKR with an estimated 70% experiencing sleep problems (Hawker et al.2010; Manning et al.2017; Wilcox et al.2000). People report problems with getting to sleep, staying asleep, and frequently night waking (M. T. Smith et al.2009). People with poorer sleep have high levels of pain catastrophising, anxiety, and depression (Boye Larsen et al.2021), all factors that predict worse post‐surgical outcomes (Jiang et al.2017; Judge et al.2012). Pre‐operative sleep problems impair healing, increase infection risk (Wright et al.2015), and can extend hospital stays by 1–8 days (Ding et al.2022). Patients with pre‐existing sleep problems are five times more likely to develop post‐operative delirium (Fadayomi et al.2018).\n\nResearch on sleep and TKR has predominantly focused on pharmacological interventions in the peri‐ and post‐operative period (Gong et al.2015; Kirksey et al.2015; Krenk et al.2014). NICE and EULAR guidance for insomnia and pain management advise against pharmacological therapy for long‐term sleep management, recommending behavioural approaches as first‐line treatment (Geenen et al.2018; NICE2021), which are more sustainable and cost‐effective, with lower risk of side effects (Koffel et al.2019). There is a paucity of research on non‐pharmacological pre‐operative interventions for TKR patients; however, there is a solid evidence base for behavioural sleep interventions for chronic pain patients, which offers promise. Three of the most well‐recognised approaches are cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT‐i), relaxation, and mindfulness. All these studies demonstrate effectiveness in improving sleep for people experiencing chronic pain (Okajima et al.2011; Sun et al.2013; Wang et al.2018; Whale et al.2022). CBT‐i comprises personalised programmes to explore and change beliefs and behaviours that affect the ability to sleep. This includes establishing a bedtime routine, sleep restriction, and limiting time spent in bed awake. CBT‐i can be delivered in person with a therapist or through automated delivery via websites and apps (eCBT‐i) (Zachariae et al.2016). Relaxation and mindfulness are the most common sleep self‐help techniques, including progressive muscle relaxation, breathing exercises, and attention regulation (Amutio et al.2018; McClusky et al.1991; Sun et al.2013). Behavioural sleep interventions are commonly used in conjunction with sleep hygiene education. Sleep hygiene consists of advice and practical information about how to achieve a good sleep environment, for example, removing electronic devices from the bedroom and having a bedtime routine. Sleep hygiene education offers useful tools for making simple changes but has limited effectiveness as a standalone treatment with best practice to combine it with other intervention approaches (Chung et al.2018).\n\nTo improve sleep for TKR patients, we developed the REST intervention (Whale and Gooberman‐Hill2022). REST is a pre‐operative sleep intervention for people undergoing TKR that brings together evidence‐based existing sleep interventions to provide tailored sleep plans, underpinned by health psychology theory. We have conducted a two‐centre feasibility randomised controlled trial, already published (Bertram et al.2024), and this article presents the results of the embedded qualitative study that explored intervention engagement and enactment.\n\nCrucially, our study makes use of health psychology theory. Such theories are vital to the design and refinement of interventions that address health behaviours. Inclusion of theory is recommended in the Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance for intervention development (Craig et al.2008; Skivington et al.2021), with evidence that imbedding behaviour change theory increases intervention effectiveness (Webb et al.2010). Understanding intervention engagement is a crucial part of intervention development and testing (Craig et al.2008; Skivington et al.2021). Successful implementation depends on the recipients being ready and willing to make changes (engagement), and being able to maintain these changes over time in order to experience benefit (enactment) (Sekhon et al.2017). Health psychology theory provides important insight on how to support individuals through this process, and where barriers may occur. For example, the transtheoretical model aids understanding of an individual's readiness to act on a new health behaviour, and the process of moving from contemplation to action and maintenance. Theories of motivation, such as Self‐Determination Theory, provide insight into how change can be sustained, showing that interventions that support people's competency and autonomy lead to greater engagement, motivation, and long‐term behaviour change (Deci and Ryan2008; O'Cathain et al.2019; Ryan et al.2008).\n\nThis article describes a qualitative research study, focussing on findings relating to engagement and enactment in the REST intervention.\n\nREST is a tailored intervention delivered approximately 3 months pre‐surgery. Patients attend a remote one‐to‐one appointment with a health professional, lasting approximately 1 hour. In the appointment, a sleep assessment identifies individual sleep issues and needs. Based on the assessment, the professional works with the participant to provide sleep hygiene advice and recommends one of three existing sleep interventions (ESIs):\n\nCognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is delivered through Sleepstation (an online platform provided by the UK's National Health Service: NHS).\n\nRelaxation, delivered through the Calm app, guided audio and/or workbook.\n\nMindfulness meditation, delivered through the Headspace app, guided audio and/or workbook.\n\nParticipants are provided with a personalised sleep plan including SMART sleep hygiene goals, a detailed overview of their chosen ESI, and any materials. Participants receive a follow‐up call from the health professional 4 weeks after their appointment to review progress and engagement. This includes addressing barriers, reviewing of the sleep goals, and adjusting the sleep plan if needed.\n\nA qualitative interview study with study participants was conducted to assess the acceptability of REST. The secondary aims were to explore levels of engagement and enactment with the sleep plan and identify any areas for refinement. The qualitative study was embedded in a feasibility randomised trial. Feasibility trials are designed to ascertain whether and how a fully powered trial could happen (Eldridge et al.2016). The REST feasibility trial found that it would be feasible to carry out a fully‐powered randomised controlled trial to evaluate the clinical and cost‐effectiveness of REST (Bertram et al.2024). The qualitative study described here provides distinct information that can be used to refine and enhance the intervention itself.\n\nThis study received a favourable opinion and approval from the Health Research Authority and Health and Care Research (University of Bristol Research Data Storage Facility).\n\nParticipants were eligible if they participated in the feasibility trial and were able to participate in an interview by telephone or videoconference. Trial participants were asked to complete a consent form, including a check box to indicate interest in the qualitative study. All individuals who indicated their interest in taking part were sent an invitation letter and reply slip and were contacted by the researcher. All participants provided written informed consent for the qualitative study.\n\nMaximum variation sampling was used with sampling criteria of gender, age, and trial arm allocation. We aimed to include 20 intervention participants (10 per site) and 5 usual care participants. During the study and to maximise recruitment, qualitative sampling was expanded to include all intervention participants who had agreed to be contacted. This was needed due to the lower than anticipated number of feasibility trial participants due to the COVID‐19 pandemic reducing the overall number of elective surgical procedures. The total sample size was 13 participants, 8 intervention and 5 usual care. The intervention arm sample was smaller than originally planned. However, qualitative research does not always need to meet a pre‐defined or a priori sample size when information power is assessed (Malterud et al.2016). Assessment of information power showed that the data in the sample enabled the study to meet its aims because of the tightly defined aims and rich data collected.\n\nIn‐depth semi‐structured interviews were conducted by an experienced qualitative researcher (EJ), informed by a topic guide developed in collaboration with the study's Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE) group and on the basis of previous research in this area. Interviews explored experiences and acceptability of the REST intervention, engaging with the chosen ESI, and the impact of REST on sleep and pain. Interviews also elicited views about trial processes, which are presented in the article that reports trial results (Bertram et al.2024).\n\nInterviews were conducted either using videoconference or telephone, depending on the participants' preference. All interviews were recorded using an encrypted digital recorder.\n\nData were analysed using an abductive approach (Vila‐Henninger et al.2022). This was conducted separately from the analysis undertaken to address the feasibility research questions, as outlined in the trial paper. Abductive coding is a flexible approach that uses deductive and inductive analysis to support the exploration of existing theories and concepts, whilst still allowing for new insights to be identified from the data. One researcher (KW) read the transcripts and undertook two stages of data coding. Firstly, a deductive analysis identified concepts related to existing health psychology theory. Secondly, an inductive analysis identified additional data‐driven codes that did not align with existing theories or provided new insights into the relationship between stages of behaviour change. Analysis was conducted by one researcher (KW) with a background in health psychology. Codes were discussed with a second researcher (RGH) with a background in health and anthropology.\n\nThe study was developed in collaboration with a musculoskeletal PPIE group comprising 5 patients with lived experience of orthopaedic surgery. The group met four times during the research term to co‐design patient‐facing study materials, monitor study progress, and review results and dissemination plans.\n\nIn total, 38 patients agreed to be contacted about taking part in an interview and were sent an invitation letter. The study team received reply slips from 16 participants, of whom 13 took part in an interview (N= 8 intervention/5 usual care). Of the remaining 3 after discussing the interview in more detail with the researcher (EJ), one decided that they were no longer interested in taking part and one declined due to a deterioration in health. The researcher was unsuccessful in contacting the third participant after multiple attempts. Interviews were between 24 and 86 min in duration and were conducted over the telephone (N= 5) or using a secure video platform (N= 8).\n\nIntervention engagement was explored with only the eight intervention group participants. Demographics for the intervention group participants are presented in Table1. All names are pseudonyms.\n\nParticipant demographics.\n\nThree thematic areas were identified:Health beliefs and readiness to change; from contemplation to enactment: the role of behaviour change techniques; and Behavioural maintenance. A diagram illustrating the relationship between each stage is presented in Figure1. Illustrative quotations for each theme are presented in Table2.\n\n\n\nDiagram of behaviour change theory and processes.\n\nIllustrative quotes.\n\n“ I mean compared to other people, there's only one person I know who sleeps worse than me and they're very neurotic [laughs] […]”\n\nI: What do you think kind of good sleep is?\n\n“… seven hours I think is fine for someone my age […] if it could be seven hours unbroken that’d be great. It’s very rare, maybe one in a hundred days I would say when I can sleep right through, wake up and it’s like, ‘I didn't wake up in the night.’ It's a very rare thing to do.”\n\nIn health psychology, health beliefs refer to a person's attitudes, values, and knowledge about health and health conditions. Readiness to change is whether or not an individual has reached the point that they are motivated and able to take action. Sleep beliefs played a pivotal role in an individual's readiness to change. Generally, participants had engaged with REST as they felt they had sleep issues and wanted to improve this. Participants said their personal motivation and belief that their sleep needed improvement meant they were highly engaged and ready to try out new techniques (quotes 1, 2 and 3).\n\nConversely, some participants felt they did not have sleep issues or their view of ‘healthy sleep’ differed from the REST guidance. One participant said their motivation for engaging with the study was to help research and others (quote 4). They saw no personal benefit in enacting the recommended behaviour change.\n\nThis incongruence caused negative emotions, such as stress and frustration, and disengagement from the recommended sleep plan (quote 5). This was particularly evident in relation to the CBT‐i recommendation to reduce time awake in bed.\n\nThese findings align with the health belief model that highlights the role of perceived threat, benefits, and barriers in deciding whether or not change behaviour (Carpenter2010). For participants who felt their sleep could be improved and had negative experiences of disturbed sleep, the threat of continued poor sleep and benefit of sleep improvement led to motivation to engage with REST. For participants who saw neither threat nor benefit, they felt no motivation to change and, in some cases, negative experiences resulted from their beliefs being contradicted.\n\nA person's ability to move from contemplating change to enacting change is a pivotal if behavioural interventions are to succeed. The behaviour change technique (BCT) taxonomy provides a range of techniques that can be applied to support change (Michie et al.2013). REST was designed to include BCTs within appointment delivery and the sleep plan. The main BCTs participants found beneficial were information from a credible source, goal setting and action planning, and restructuring of the physical environment.\n\nInformation from a credible source took place during the intervention appointment with Extended Scope Practitioners and Advanced Physiotherapists who had experience of working with musculoskeletal and orthopaedic surgery patients. Participants reported high confidence in the health professional's knowledge and advice, which in turn gave them confidence and motivation to engage with the sleep plan (quote 6). Feeling supported and listened to was important. Several participants highlighted that autonomy and having a role in the decision‐making process was valued (quotes 7 and 8).\n\nGoal setting and action planning BCTs were central to REST. Following the assessment, participants were provided with a personalised sleep plan including SMART sleep hygiene goals. This involved agreeing goals which were specific, measureable, achievable, relevant and time‐bound. This process included BCTs for goal setting (behaviour), problem solving, goal setting (outcome), action planning, and discrepancy between current behaviour and goal.\n\nThese approaches proved particularly effective for addressing caffeine intake, which was found to be high in many participants. One participant discussed how the appointment helped them become aware of the amount of coffee they were drinking, and to make an achievable plan to reduce this (quotes 9 and 10). Another participant described how having a clear plan for engaging with their chosen ESI (relaxation) helped it feel manageable and achievable (quote 11).\n\nSleep hygiene recommendations are often centred around another known BCT: restructuring of the physical environment. This focused on creating a positive sleep environment including a bedroom that was dark, cool, comfortable, and free from digital devices, televisions, and pets. The most common change was the removal of the television (quotes 12 and 13). Other participants had added items to the environment such as blackout curtains or low‐level lighting (quotes 14 and 15).\n\nBehavioural maintenance is the final stage of supporting long‐term change where the participant is able to sustain the new behaviours over time. Theories of behaviour change maintenance focus on the role of motives, self‐regulation, and habit formation (Kwasnicka et al.2016).\n\nSelf‐regulation theories suggest that motivation to avoid negative consequences, such as adverse effects of poor sleep, is not enough to maintain behaviours that require active effort. To transition into long‐term change, positive reinforcement is needed, such as enjoyment of the activity or positive health results, as highlighted in temporal self‐regulation theory (Hall and Fong2007) and the model of behaviour maintenance (Rothman2000). Positive reinforcement leads individuals to psychologically evaluate their behaviour changes as constructive and worth continued investment, and are more likely to make positive self‐judgements about their behaviour, also known as intrinsic motivation (Deci and Ryan2008; Ryan and Deci2000).\n\nThese theories reflect the experiences of participants who reported improvements in their sleep and were motivated to maintain the change they had made (quotes 16 and 17). One participant talked about making changes to their bedtime routine, which then became habitual and of benefit (quote 18).\n\nCompetence and autonomy are core aspects of successful self‐regulation (Ryan and Deci2000; Ryan et al.2008). To foster intrinsic motivation individuals need to feel capable of performing the behaviour and that it is their choice to do so. Within behaviour change interventions, this can be supported through shared decision making and tailoring (personalising intervention approaches to meet individual needs). REST offers tailoring through personalised sleep hygiene advice and choice of one of three ESIs. However, data indicated that participants engaged in further tailoring to make their sleep plans work best for them.\n\nSeveral participants who engaged with mindfulness and relaxation said the recommended resources did not work for them, but had found alternatives. One participant used an alternative mindfulness app (quote 19). Another discussed challenges of using an app in bed when his wife was present, and instead preferred to listen to relaxing music, such as Classic FM (quotes 20 and 21). In these cases, the adaptations proved to be effective and positive for the participants, meaning they could engage in relaxation in ways that suited their lifestyle and preferences.\n\nImproving sleep for patients undergoing TKR can benefit preparation for surgery and post‐surgical recovery. Improving sleep can reduce post‐surgical pain severity and analgesia consumption, support immune function and improve wound healing (Tamrat et al.2014; Wright et al.2015). Reduction of pre‐operative pain levels through improved sleep can also benefit patients in the longer term by reducing the risk of developing chronic post‐surgical pain (Sayers et al.2016).\n\nBehavioural sleep management approaches are dependent on substantial engagement and enactment from individuals, which can be a barrier to success. Exploring engagement and enactment with the REST sleep intervention through health psychology theory has highlighted important areas of consideration in intervention feasibility and future implementation. Health beliefs played a pivotal role in motivation and readiness to change. This was particularly apparent in relation to beliefs about what constituted ‘healthy sleep’ and ‘healthy sleep behaviours’. This reflects previous studies which have indicated that dysfunctional sleep beliefs are maintaining mechanism of insomnia (Thakral et al.2020). Population level work has found that common dysfunctional beliefs include underestimating the number of hours sleep needed and that it is best to stay in bed if you have trouble sleeping (Pantesco and Kan2022; Robbins et al.2019), both of which were identified in this study.\n\nThe finding that some participants did not believe they had any issues with their sleep, despite reporting eligible sleep disturbance screening scores, was unexpected but raises important considerations for future iterations of REST and NHS practice implementation. An assessment of sleep beliefs and readiness to change could be added to triage people who may benefit from education on healthy sleep, and raise awareness of how their current sleep behaviours might be impacting their sleep quality and joint pain.\n\nREST was designed as a tailored intervention to support competence and autonomy. Participants appreciated the shared decision‐making process, and the personalised SMART goals. Data highlighted that participants were making further adaptations to the mindfulness and relaxation delivery mechanism. This benefitted engagement levels and supported sustained change; however, it raises potential challenges around intervention fidelity. This is an important assessment at the feasibility stage of intervention development, and is a common tension in interventions which include aspects of tailoring and adaptation (Toomey et al.2020). Previous explorations of the fidelity/adaptation boundary have suggested that fidelity should be based on causal mechanisms to ensure intervention effectiveness, whilst allowing for a level of adaptation to promote implementation and sustainability (Bopp et al.2013). Viewed through this perspective, the use of alternative apps for relaxation and mindfulness would be wholey acceptable. The evidence base for music improving sleep quality is less established; however, a recent systematic review indicated effectiveness for sedative music for older adults (Chen et al.2021). To ensure that adaptations maintain the core causal mechanisms, REST could benefit from providing participants with a wider range of evidence‐based alternatives to select from and include discussions about this selection during the appointment or at the 4‐week follow‐up.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that all participants in REST were English speakers, were able to read and write in English, and were all identified as white British/English or Welsh. Not including a diverse range of participants in the intervention development and feasibility testing limits the transferability of findings and may exacerbate existing health inequalities and access, as the intervention design will not have taken into consideration the views and needs of different groups. Within orthopaedics there are widespread inequalities in the provision of joint replacement surgery, and in outcomes after joint surgery (Klemt et al.2021; M. C. Smith et al.2017; Zhang et al.2016). To ensure that interventions such as REST can benefit all patients, future work should seek to gain involvement from racially marginalised groups in order to understand differences in engagement and relevance, cultural context, and benefit.\n\nExploring participants' experiences of engaging in a surgical prehabilitation intervention through the lens of health psychology theory has provided important insights into intervention feasibility, and the stages of behaviour change. This is important for surgeons and multidisciplinary teams to consider when developing new prehabilitation care pathways or when implementing evidence‐based prehabilitation practices. Interview data has highlighted key stages of behaviour change that need to be supported to achieve full benefit from prehabilitation: readiness to change, enactment, and behavioural maintenance. Complex behaviour change interventions which include aspects of tailoring should consider the boundaries of acceptable adaption while maintaining core causal mechanisms, and include methods to explore real‐world implementation and usability during the development process.\n\nKatie Whale:Study Chief Investigator, conceptualisation (lead), funding acquisition (lead), project administration (lead), methodology (lead), formal analysis (lead), writing – original draft preparation (lead), writing – review and editing (lead).Emma Johson:Investigation, data collection (lead), project administration, writing – review and editing.Rachael Gooberman‐Hill:conceptualisation, funding acquisition (co‐applicant), methodology, supervision, formal analysis, writing – review and editing.\n\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\nFunding:This study was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) (Research for Patient Benefit; grant reference number NIHR201036).

They exhibit remarkable structural variability due to differences in the number and position of C=C bonds in their tetracyclic backbone and side chain composition. When analysed using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), PSs often produce complex and potentially informative spectra, as in the case of electron ionization. However, these spectra have been only partially interpreted so far. Here, a systematic interpretation of the fragmentation of PSs, specifically free sterols, was pursued through a synergic use of high‐ and low‐resolution multistage mass spectrometry (MSn,n= 2–4).\n\nThe study focused on protonated and dehydrated forms of standard 4‐desmethyl‐sterols ([M + H‐H2O]+), generated via atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) following reversed‐phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). Deuterium‐labelled versions of cholesterol and stigmasterol, appropriately labelled on their side chains, were examined alongside their natural counterparts and other key PS standards, including β‐sitosterol, campesterol, brassicasterol, Δ5‐avenasterol (isofucosterol) and its isomer Δ7‐avenasterol.\n\nThe use of isotopically labelled standards allowed the identification of diagnostic, lowm/z, product ions associated with the side chain, demonstrating that the positive charge can localize not only at the C3 position (associated with the hydroxyl group) but also on the side chain itself (C24/C25). Furthermore, all remaining peak signals in the tandem MS spectra of PSs were successfully elucidated with the help of MS3/MS4measurements, unveiling complex fragmentation pathways involving both the steroidal backbone and the side chain and indicating C17 as an additional potential site for positive charge localization.\n\nThe findings described in the paper offer a strong basis for identifying critical structural features of PSs, thus opening interesting perspectives for the identification of minor PSs, often isomeric with more common ones, that can be detected in vegetal matrices.\n\nKeywords:atmospheric pressure chemical ionization, high‐resolution tandem mass spectrometry, isotopically labelled standards, multistage mass spectrometry, phytosterols\n\nPhytosterols (PSs) are sterols occurring in plant cell membranes, particularly in raft domains [1]. These ordered and nanoscale regions, where PSs exhibit association with sphingolipids and proteins, play a role in key cellular processes such as plant growth and development, signal transduction in response to environmental stresses and cell‐to‐cell communication through plasmodesmata [2,3]. As shown in Figure1, PSs share the tetracyclic structure of cyclopenta[α]phenanthrene, in whichtransjunctures connect the four rings (A, B, C and D). Two methyl groups are located at C18 and C19, and a side chain (SC) is linked to C17, according to the atom numbering recommended by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) [3,4,5]. Among PSs, free sterols (FSs) are characterized by a hydroxyl group at C3 having β stereochemistry [6], which can be either esterified by a free fatty acid, giving a steryl ester, or form a 1‐O‐β‐glycosidic bond with a hexose, generating a steryl glycoside. If an acyl chain is bound to the C6′ of the sugar, acylated steryl glycosides are obtained [7,8]. FSs can be generally subdivided into 4‐desmethyl, 4α‐methyl and 4,4‐dimethyl sterols, depending on the number of substituents at C4 [9], although the latter two species, acting as precursors of 4‐desmethyl sterols, are scarcely present in plant tissues [10]. Among 4‐desmethyl‐sterols, Δ5‐, Δ7‐, Δ5,7‐ and Δ8‐sterols include one or two C=C bonds on the B ring (see Figure1), distinguishing them from stanols, their saturated counterparts [8]. However, most of the over 250 PSs identified in nature so far [11] are Δ5‐4‐desmethyl‐sterols, which differ from each other for their SC, as shown in Figure1for some of the most important FSs.\n\n\n\n(Left side) General chemical structure of Δ5‐4‐desmethyl‐sterols. Carbon atoms are numbered according to the rules established by IUPAC in 1989. (Right side) Side chain (SC) structures and common names for sterols considered in the present study. Δ7‐avenasterol shares the side chain with isofucosterol but has the C=C double bond on a different position of Ring B (between C7 and C8). The numbering of all atoms on the side chain is shown in the case of cholesterol. The C24 configuration is highlighted in the case of campesterol, brassicasterol, β‐sitosterol and stigmasterol.\n\nCholesterol (CHO), the simplest species among Δ5‐sterols, characterized by an unsaturated and unbranched SC and representing the most abundant sterol in animal tissues, is also present, in low amounts, in plant cells [1,12]. As evidenced in Figure1, the presence of a methyl or an ethyl group linked to C24 of CHO leads to the structures of campesterol and β‐sitosterol, which are among the most abundant PSs [11]. The methylation reaction at C24 may generate both α and β epimers, while the introduction of an ethyl substituent preferentially produces α epimers [4]. Other relevant PSs are brassicasterol and stigmasterol, corresponding to the unsaturated analogues of campesterol and β‐sitosterol, respectively, both having a double bond on C22–C23 [5,6] (see Figure1). Modification of C24 may also introduce an ethylidene group, leading to isofucosterol, also known as Δ5‐avenasterol, representing another non‐negligible PS, often accompanied by its positional isomer Δ7‐avenasterol, having a C=C bond between C7 and C8 on Ring B (see Figure1).\n\nThe structural variability of PSs poses a challenge for their qualitative/quantitative analysis in plant extracts, aiming at the assessment of their nutraceutical potential, since PSs have been reported to lower CHO levels and exert antiobesity, anti‐inflammatory and anticancer activities [13,14,15].\n\nGas chromatography coupled with electron ionization mass spectrometry (GC‐EI‐MS) has long been the conventional method for sterol analysis, including PSs. In fact, major sterols can be separated effectively using low‐medium polarity GC columns [11,16,17,18,19,20], provided they are preliminarily derivatized to trimethylsilyl (TMS) ethers or steryl acetates to enhance volatility and ionization efficiency [21,22]. With the advent of soft atmospheric pressure ionization (API) sources, suitable for the coupling between liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, reversed‐phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) based on C8 or C18 stationary phases has emerged as a powerful alternative [1,23]. This approach eliminates the risks of incomplete derivatization and thermal degradation related to GC conditions. Among API processes, electrospray ionization (ESI) is usually performed on sterols after chemical derivatizations, such as the generation of picolinic esters, aimed at boosting the ionization efficiency [24,25,26]. Proton and sodium adducts are usually produced by sterols under positive ESI conditions [27,28]. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) in positive mode has significantly increased sensitivity (up to two orders of magnitude), leading only to the protonation of the sterols OH group, followed by in‐source loss of water (H2O) to form [M + H‐H2O]+ions [9,29,30]. As a result, RPLC‐APCI‐MS has become a popular method for identifying FSs in food products, including plant‐based ones, although their quantification is limited to species for which standards are available [27,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38].\n\nActually, the occurrence of several FS isomers, some of which do not correspond to available standards, is common in complex matrices like plant extracts. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), successfully adopted so far for the analysis of other lipid compounds, like glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids and sulfolipids [39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47], represents a promising approach to recognize structural features of sterols, even for species not matching available standards. However, to the best of our knowledge, only two studies have delved so far into a detailed characterization of MS/MS spectra obtained for FSs, which can be complex due to the progressive fragmentation of their structures.

[30] used high‐resolution APCI‐MS/MS relying on the so‐called higher collisional energy dissociation (HCD) mode enabled by the Thermo Scientific Q‐Exactive quadrupole‐Orbitrap mass spectrometer (which actually corresponds to a typical collision‐induced dissociation (CID) in terms of the ion energies involved) and APCI‐MSn(withn= 2, 3) based on a quadrupole‐linear ion trap mass spectrometer to reconstruct the fragmentation patterns of stigmasterol, brassicasterol, β‐sitosterol and campesterol. Münger et al. [48] compared CID‐MS/MS spectra obtained for ESI‐generated positive precursor ions of the aglycones of dietary steryl glycosides with those related to protonated and dehydrated FS ions, which are isomeric with the aglycone ions. These studies highlighted product ions providing insights into the number and position of double bonds on the B ring of the sterol structure. Product ions related to neutral losses occurring from the SC structure of sterols were also evidenced [48], suggesting that a careful interpretation of the sterol complex fragmentation patterns might yield valuable structural information.\n\nStarting from this background, a systematic evaluation has been recently undertaken in our laboratory for fragmentation patterns of specific PS standards using APCI‐tandem/sequential mass spectrometry (APCI‐MSn, withn= 2–4). These experiments were performed under different mass resolution conditions. CHO‐d6and stigmasterol‐d5, isotopically labelled on the respective SCs, were also included among the analysed species to clarify some of the fragmentation pathways. A detailed interpretation of the fragmentation patterns observed for FSs will be discussed in the present work, with a focus on the unexpected product ions arising from the sterol SC. The latter suggested different possible locations of the positive charge of [M + H‐H2O]+ions of FSs. The differences observed for major Δ5‐sterols, as well as between them and Δ7‐avenasterol, will also be discussed to provide general guidelines that might assist in identifying structural features of uncommon sterols, particularly when standards are unavailable.\n\nLC grade acetonitrile (ACN), water (H2O) and formic acid (FA), used for RPLC separations, HPLC grade chloroform (CHCl3) and ethanol (EtOH), employed as solvents for stock solutions, were purchased from Merck (Milan, Italy). Standards of CHO‐d6(cholest‐5‐en‐26,26,26,27,27,27‐d6‐3β‐ol), CHO (cholest‐5‐en‐3β‐ol), campesterol (campest‐5‐en‐3β‐ol), brassicasterol (ergosta‐5,22E‐dien‐3β‐ol), β‐sitosterol (stigmast‐5‐en‐3β‐ol), stigmasterol (stigmasta‐5,22E‐dien‐3β‐ol), isofucosterol (24Z‐ethylidene‐cholest‐5‐en‐3β‐ol) and Δ7‐avenasterol (24Z‐ethylidene‐cholest‐7‐en‐3β‐ol) were acquired from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Standard stigmasterol‐d5(stigmasta‐5,22E‐dien‐24′,24′,24″,24″,24″‐d5‐3β‐ol) was purchased from Merck (Milan, Italy). The solutions required for the calibration of mass spectrometers under positive or negative polarity conditions were purchased from Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA).\n\nA stock solution of each standard (1 mg/mL) was prepared in an EtOH:CHCl3mixture (2:1v/v), and a diluted solution (30 μg/mL) was subsequently obtained in 100% ACN. Moreover, through appropriate dilutions from stock solutions, a comprehensive mix of standards (10 μg/mL for each one) was prepared in 100% ACN.\n\nMixtures of standard sterols were analysed using an Ultimate 3000 HPLC system coupled with a Q‐Exactive high‐resolution quadrupole‐Orbitrap Fourier‐transform mass spectrometer through an APCI interface (Thermo Fisher, West Palm Beach, CA, USA). A C18 Ascentis Express HPLC column (150 × 2.1 mm id, 2.7 μm particle size) (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) and the following multistep binary elution gradient, based on H2O as Phase A and ACN as Phase B, both containing 0.1% (v/v) FA, were adopted for the separation of FSs: 0–40 min, linear increase of B from 90% to 100%; 40–50 min, isocratic at 100% B; 50–52 min, linear decrease of B from 100% to 90%; 52–60 min, reconditioning at 90% B. Flow rate was set at 0.250 mL/min, and column temperature was kept at 30°C; 5 μL sample volumes were injected. The parameters of the APCI interface and of the ion optics of the Q‐Exactive spectrometer were set as follows: sheath gas flow rate, 40 a.u.; auxiliary gas flow rate, 10 a.u.; capillary temperature, 300°C; S‐lens RF level, 55 a.u.; vaporizer temperature, 250°C. Full scan MS acquisitions in positive ion mode were obtained in a 250–500m/zinterval, working with a 140 000 resolving power atm/z200; the automatic gain control (AGC) level was set at 1 × 106, and the maximum injection time was 100 ms. HCD‐FTMS/MS acquisitions were performed at a 35 000 resolving power in a 50–500m/zinterval, selecting a 1.0m/zisolation window for precursor ions and using normalized collisional energy (NCE) at a value of 30 units; the AGC level was set at 2 × 105, and maximum injection time was 100 ms. The spectrometer was calibrated every 2 days by infusing, at a 30 μL/min flow rate, calibration solutions for positive or negative polarity acquisitions provided by the instrument manufacturer, thus obtaining a mass accuracy always better than 5 ppm.\n\nAPCI‐direct infusion analyses (APCI‐DIAs) of individual standards solutions (30 μg/mL) were performed using both the Q‐Exactive spectrometer, under the same conditions described before, and a Velos Pro mass spectrometer, equipped with a two‐stage linear ion trap (Thermo Fisher, West Palm Beach, CA). Specifically, APCI‐DIA‐HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra were collected for specific sterols (vide infra) in the former case, whereas APCI‐DIA‐CID‐MSn(n= 2, 4) experiments were performed with the linear ion trap instrument in order to elucidate major fragmentation patterns of all available FSs. The main operating parameters of the Velos Pro APCI interface and ion optics were set as follows: sheath gas flow rate, 40 a.u.; auxiliary gas flow rate, 10 a.u.; capillary temperature, 300°C; S‐lens RF level, 60 a.u.; vaporizer temperature, 250°C. A 1.0m/zisolation window for the precursor ion and a NCE of 40 units for MS/MS and 25 units for MS3/MS4were adopted; the AGC level was set at 2 × 103, and the maximum injection time was 100 ms.\n\nAs a first step of the present study, RPLC‐APCI(+)‐FTMS was carried out on a mixture of standard sterols to explore the relationship between structure and retention time. Firstly, an isocratic separation based on 100% ACN containing 0.1% FA was attempted. However, a complete overlap was observed for peaks of positional isomers isofucosterol (Δ5‐avenasterol) and Δ7‐avenasterol, which share the same SC (see Figure1). After several tests based on gradient elution, with H2O added to the mobile phase as the second solvent, suitable chromatographic conditions were identified, as detailed in the experimental section, allowing an effective separation of the two avenasterols. Figure2shows multiple extracted ion current (EIC) chromatograms finally obtained for monoisotopicm/zratios referred to the [M + H‐H2O]+ions generated by APCI for standard sterols, grouped according to the characteristics of their SC: (A) not alkylated on C24, (B) 24‐methyl and (C) 24‐ethylidene and 24‐ethyl.\n\n\n\nDetailed views of multiple extracted ion current (EIC) chromatograms referred to standard FSs considered in the present study, grouped according to their side chain (see Figure1). (A) Cholesterol and its hexa‐deuterated analogue, that are two FSs not alkylated on C24: (B) 24‐methyl‐FSs and (C) 24‐ethyl‐ and 24‐ethylidene‐FSs. The following exactm/zvalues, referred to monoisotopic [M + H‐H2O]+ions, were selected for ion current extraction: cholesterol, 369.3516; cholesterol‐d6, 375.3892; brassicasterol, 381.3516; campesterol, 383.3672; stigmasterol, Δ7‐avenasterol and isofucosterol (Δ5‐avenasterol), 395.3672; β‐sitosterol, 397.3829; and penta‐deuterated stigmasterol, 400.3987.\n\nThe effect on the retention of deuteration of the two methyl groups linked to C25 in CHO‐d6and of the ethyl group linked to C24 in stigmasterol‐d5can be easily inferred from Figure2, since a decrease (0.5/0.4 min) in retention time with respect to the corresponding nondeuterated analogues was observed (see Figure2A,C, respectively). On the other hand, Figure2highlights the key role played by the sterol SC in the interaction with the octadecylic stationary phase.\n\nSterols with the same number and position of double bonds on the B ring but different SCs showed a clear pattern in retention. Based on their C24 substituent, those with a saturated SC were retained in the order: H < methyl < ethyl, corresponding to CHO < campesterol < β‐sitosterol (see Figure2). A similar trend was observed for sterols including a double bond at C22–C23, with brassicasterol (methylated on C24) being less retained than stigmasterol (ethylated on C24). The occurrence of a C=C bond in the SC reduced the retention time compared to species with a saturated SC, as clearly inferred from the comparison between retention times of stigmasterol and β‐sitosterol in Figure2C. This effect, consistent with that observed for fatty acids including one or more C=C bonds, when comparing their retention with the one of saturated fatty acids (see, e.g., Ref. [49]), varied depending on the C=C bond's location, being more relevant when it was closer to the end of the chain. Indeed, Δ7‐avenasterol and isofucosterol, having a C=C bond between C24 and C24′, exhibited a more relevant reduction in retention time (over 10 min) with respect to β‐sitosterol than stigmasterol (4 min), whose C=C bond is located between C22 and C23 (see Figure2). The effect on retention exerted by the location of the C=C bond on Ring B was more subtle. Indeed, Δ7‐avenasterol was less retained than its positional isomer isofucosterol (Δ5‐avenasterol), suggesting that the closer proximity to the SC of the C=C bond between C7 and C8 reduced its interaction with the stationary phase. It is worth noting that an inversion in the respective retention times of the two isomeric avenasterols was observed by Jiang et al. using a C18 column and an isocratic elution based on ACN/methanol 99:1 (v/v), whereas the retention order of campesterol and β‐sitosterol was in accordance with the one observed during the present study [30].\n\nThe chromatographic behaviour described so far suggests that relative retention might be one of the tools for the recognition of new isomeric sterols in complex matrices, especially to infer the characteristics of their SC, by comparison with standards of known sterols. As shown in the following section, a careful interpretation of fragmentation pathways obtained by HCD‐FTMS/MS and CID‐MSnfor standard sterols, including those deuterated on appropriate positions of the molecular structure, provided valuable additional information, potentially useful for the identification of new PSs.\n\nTo understand the general fragmentation pattern of Δ5‐sterols with a fully saturated SC, a comparison was made between CHO and its analogue deuterated on the two methyl groups linked to C25 (abbreviated as CHO‐d6in the following). The APCI (+)‐HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra acquired for the respective [M + H‐H2O]+ions (having exactm/zvalues: 369.3516 and 375.3892) are shown in Figure3. For the sake of comparison, the APCI (+)‐HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra obtained for all the other sterols considered in the present study, excepting stigmasterol and its penta‐deuterated counterpart (vide infra), are grouped in Figure4. The complex fragmentation pattern typically observed in tandem MS spectra of FSs reported in previous studies [30,48,50,51,52], leading to a characteristic distribution of product ion abundances, can be easily recognized in all spectra included in the two figures. Notably, a similar pattern has been systematically observed over more than four decades in sterol spectra obtained using electron ionization with high electron energy (70 eV) [53]. The comparison between spectra shown in Figures3and4reveals that sterol fragmentation produces apparently similar clusters of peaks, yet subtle variations in their relative abundances can be recognized by a deeper evaluation. To explore the correlation between structural features and specific abundance profiles, a systematic interpretation of those patterns based also on CID‐MSnwas undertaken in this study, including MS3analyses (like in the study by Jiang et al. [30]) and, for the first time, also MS4acquisitions.\n\n\n\nAPCI(+)‐HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra referred to [M + H‐H2O]+ions of cholesterol (Plot A) and cholesterol completely deuterated on methyl groups linked to C24 (cholesterol‐d6, Plot B), having exactm/z369.3516 and 375.3892, respectively. Ions sharing the same number of C atoms but differing for the number of H and/or D atoms were grouped within a single cluster, indicated by a capital letter. The MS/MS spectrum of cholesterol‐d6m/zvalues related to ions including six D atoms were reported in red. The NL numbers represent normalization levels (measured as counts/s) related to each spectrum. See text for details.\n\n\n\nAPCI(+)‐HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra acquired for the [M + H‐H2O]+ions of the standard sterols considered during the present study, along with cholesterol and stigmasterol. Peak signals referred to product ions sharing the same number of carbon atoms and differing in the number of H atoms were grouped within a single cluster, identified by a capital letter. The experimentalm/zratio obtained for the most abundant signal in each cluster is reported. The NL numbers represent normalization levels (measured as counts/s) related to each spectrum.\n\nTo facilitate the description of spectral features, peak signals related to product ions having the same number of carbon atoms but differing in the number of H or D atoms were grouped within a single cluster, identified by a capital letter. Moreover,m/zvalues referred to ions including D atoms were highlighted in red in Figure3B. Experimentalm/zvalues rounded off to the fourth decimal place, molecular formulas inferred from them considering a maximum accuracy of 5 ppm and relative intensities for peak signals detected in each cluster for CHO and CHO‐d6are reported in TableS1of the Supporting Information. Minor product ions, not labelled in Figure3for the sake of clarity, are also included in the table.\n\nAs emphasized by the red labels in Figure3B, a 6‐unit shift in nominalm/zvalues was observed for several product ions when the precursor ion of CHO‐d6was fragmented. This shift, found in Clusters A, B, N, O, P, Q, R, S and T, indicates the presence of the deuterated part of the SC in the corresponding structure. A systematic comparison across clusters provided further insights into this finding. Two extreme cases were identified: peak signals whose nominalm/zvalues were univocally displaced by 6 units (see boldm/zvalues in TableS1) and those which did not change at all theirm/zvalues (apart from fluctuations on the fourth decimal digit, due to instrumental precision, occurring inm/zvalues underlined in TableS1) when CHO‐d6was fragmented. These results indicated which product ions included the SC and which did not. For the remaining product ions, parallel mechanisms had to be considered. In these cases, both them/zvalue already observed for nondeuterated CHO and one or more new ones, suggesting the presence of 5 or 6 D atoms in the ion structure, were recognized in the FTMS/MS spectrum of CHO‐d6. For example, the product ion detected atm/z57.0708 in the MS/MS spectrum of CHO (Cluster A), consistent with a molecular formula C4H9+(exactm/z57.0699), was observed as a very weak signal also in the MS/MS spectrum of CHO‐d6(see TableS1), but it was accompanied by a relatively stronger signal atm/z63.1083, compatible with the formula C4H3D6+(exactm/z63.1075). As shown on the right side of Scheme1, this formula can be related to the structure of a hexa‐deuteratedtert‐butyl carbocation, arising from a dissociation occurring on the SC of CHO‐d6. The corresponding ion for CHO is a conventionaltert‐butyl carbocation, having an exactm/z57.0699, whose structure is also reported in Scheme1.\n\n\n\nFragmentation pathways hypothesized for cholesterol and cholesterol hexa‐deuterated on methyl groups linked to C25 considering their [M + H‐H2O]+ions generated in the APCI source, with positive charge located (left side) on C3 (where the charge is originally located); (right side) on one of the terminal carbon atoms of the side chain. Plain arrows indicate fragmentations observed in MS/MS spectra (under both HCD and CID conditions); dashed arrows indicate fragmentations observed in CID‐MS3/MS4spectra. Boxes include multiple product ions observed in a single MSn(n= 2–4) spectrum. Exactm/zratios (rounded off to the fourth decimal place) are reported for all product ions.\n\nThe generation of these product ions provided a very important and, to the best of our knowledge, unprecedented evidence of the presence of multiple possible locations of positive charge on the structure of the [M + H‐H2O]+precursor ions, alternative to C3, which is usually proposed as the unique location of positive charge for those ions (see, e.g., Refs.30,48). As illustrated in Scheme1, the presence of positive charge on C25, leading to a tertiary carbocation, is required to explain the generation of the ion with exactm/z63.1075 when CHO‐d6is fragmented. By analogy, this feature also accounts for the generation of ions with exactm/z71.0855 and 77.1232, when CHO and CHO‐d6are fragmented, respectively. A detailed representation of the processes hypothesized to explain the generation of these ions and of all the other major product ions withm/zlower than 100 detected upon fragmentation of CHO and CHO‐d6is provided in FigureS1of the Supporting Information. In this case, as in most fragmentation process hypothesized to explain the generation of sterol product ions (vide infra), the proposed mechanism was a 1,3‐H migration between two carbon atoms, with a bond breakage occurring between the second and the third atom involved in the migration and the generation of a C=C bond between the first and the second atom, in accordance with a mechanism proposed in the literature for the charge remote fragmentation of long‐chain functionalized alkanes and alkenes [54].\n\nInterestingly, as indicated in the upper‐left part of Scheme1, a product ion with exactm/z57.0699 might be generated also by CHO‐d6if the positive charge was located on the typical C3 position, since it would result from the fragmentation of Ring A. However, as shown in the fragmentation reaction reported at the top of FigureS1, this process would likely imply the release of a very strained neutral fragment. This might explain the appearance of a very weak peak signal at am/zratio of 57.0708, consistent with the exact value of 57.0699, in the MS/MS spectrum of CHO‐d6(see TableS1).\n\nNotably, other product ions detected in Clusters A and B for CHO and CHO‐d6could only be explained by considering additional possible locations of the positive charge near the end of the CHO SC, specifically at C24 and C26 atoms (see the right side of Scheme1and FigureS1), in addition to C25. The most plausible, though somewhat unusual, process leading to the displacement of the positive charge on positions like C24, C25 and C26 is a hydride transfer occurring from the carbon atom representing the new location of the positive charge to C3, where the charge was initially located after the in‐source loss of H2O from the protonated form of CHO. Notably, Bao et al. [55] previously proposed an intramolecular hydride transfer occurring upon CID in the case of cyclopentenone oxylipins. On the other hand, hydride abstraction was reported to occur from hydrocarbon chains during positive ion APCI, leading to carbocations [56]. If occurring on sterols, this process would lead to [M‐H]+ions or, in the case of subsequent in‐source H2O loss, to [M‐H‐H2O]+ions, yet none of them showed a significant intensity in APCI(+)‐FTMS spectra of sterols in the present case, thus strengthening the hypothesis that the protonation of the OH group, followed by H2O loss and generation of a carbocation on C3, was the prevailing ionization process occurring in the APCI(+) source.\n\nA systematic interpretation of the spectral profiles displayed in Figure3reveals that at least one other possible location of positive charge on the structure of CHO and CHO‐d6[M + H‐H2O]+ions needs to be hypothesized to explain major product ions detected in MS/MS spectra. A key approach during this step of the investigation, expanding the use of MS3already reported for some sterols by Jiang et al. [30], involved the acquisition of the MS3spectrum for each major product ion detected in HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra shown in Figure3and of MS4spectra for selected product ions detected in MS3spectra. These MS3and MS4spectra were obtained under low energy CID conditions using a linear ion trap mass spectrometer, after verifying that each product ion detected in HCD‐MS/MS spectra was also present in low energy CID‐MS/MS ones. A set of genealogical trees, describing schematically the information inferred from MS3and MS4acquisitions performed during the present study on sterols, is included in FigureS2of the Supporting Information.\n\nAs a result, solid arrows in Scheme1indicate transitions directly observed at the MS/MS stage, while dashed ones represent selected transitions observed at either the MS3or the MS4stage that led to product ions detected also in MS/MS spectra (the complete representation of all transitions experimentally observed is available in FigureS2). Additionally, boxes reported in the schemes include all major product ions detected directly in an MS/MS (if preceded by a solid arrow) or MS3(if preceded by a dashed arrow) spectrum, with the precursor being the ion preceding a specific box. For example, the product ions with exactm/zvalues of 229.1951 and 215.1794 (belonging to Clusters N and M, respectively) shown in a box on the left side of Scheme1were detected in the 375 > 257 > MS3spectrum of CHO‐d6and also in the 369 > 257 > MS3spectrum of CHO (see also the respective genealogical trees in FigureS2). In this case, the 375 > 313 > 243 > MS4spectrum clarified that them/z215.1794 ion could be generated from the 243 one (as indicated by the curved dashed arrow connecting the two ions in Scheme1), whereas them/z229.1951 ion was directly generated from the precursor ion with exactm/z257.2264 (see the genealogical trees for CHO‐d6in FigureS2). The remarkable amount of spectral information obtained through the adopted multistage MS approach required a complex and careful interpretation, yet it provided an unprecedented level of detail for CHO fragmentation, representing a crucial foundation for explaining the spectral differences observed for other sterols under study, considering their structural differences.\n\nAs shown on the left side of Scheme1, the typical location hypothesized for the positive charge in the CHO [M + H‐H2O]+ion, that is, C3 (where the original OH group is linked), was considered a starting point for the interpretation of fragmentation pathways. This approach successfully explained the formation of major product ions in Clusters T (exactm/z313.2890) and S (exactm/z299.2739) and a minor ion in Cluster P (exactm/z257.2264) through dissociations involving the CHO SC, with the complete detachment of the deuterated portion, if present. A description of the specific processes hypothesized to explain the generation of those ions is provided in FigureS3of the Supporting Information. However, these mechanisms could not account for the generation of product ions withm/zvalues systematically shifted by 6 units in the case of CHO‐d6(see Figure3B), thus suggesting that further pathways had to be considered (vide infra). Notably, Scheme1reports plausible product ions originating from product ions T, S and P, all with the positive charge located on C3 and detected in MS3/MS4spectra. The corresponding fragmentation processes, described in detail in FigureS3, involve the sequential opening and fragmentation of Rings D, C and B of CHO, without the displacement of the original C5–C6 double bond. As emphasized in FigureS3, the proposed processes often involve the already mentioned 1,3‐H migration with a C‐C bond breakage and a C=C bond formation. Moreover, the subsequent generation of different structures of the same ion has often to be invoked to finally account for the formation of a specific product ion. Notably, the structure proposed for the product ion consistent with an exactm/z147.1168 (Cluster H), which is the base peak in the HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra of CHO (see Figure3), matches exactly with the ones proposed by Jiang et al. in the fragmentation scheme for stigmasterol [30] and by Münger et al. [48], who identified that ion as a general diagnostic product ion for Δ5sterols. The structure shown for that ion in Scheme1and FigureS3is also consistent with the detection of the most abundant product ion at nominalm/z149 reported by Igarashi et al. [52] when fragmenting CHO including two carbon‐13 (13C) atoms at C3 and C4. An excellent agreement was also found with the results reported by Trösken et al. [50] and Mo et al. [57] for the structure proposed in Scheme1and FigureS3for another relevant product ion, the I one corresponding to an exactm/z161.1325. Indeed, this structure corresponds to that of the product ion detected at nominalm/z167 by those authors when fragmenting CHO deuterated twice on C2 and C4 and once on C3 and C6 [50,57]. Notably, Tröskenet al. detected further relevant product ions at nominalm/z81 and 95 for CHO deuterated on those carbon atoms [50]. However, no plausible mechanism could be found to produce ions with thosem/zratios assuming that the positive charge was on C3. This failure, along with the total lack of explanation for hexa‐deuterated forms of ions T and S, and for major deuterated and nondeuterated ions belonging to Clusters O, P, Q and R observed in the present study, strongly suggested that additional mechanisms, likely implying different charge locations with respect to those reported in Scheme1, had to be hypothesized.\n\nThe key for the individuation of a new charge location was provided by the ion detected atm/z81.0705 for both CHO and CHO‐d6(see Figure3), thus certainly not including the terminal part of the SC. A plausible mechanism leading to a product ion with an exactm/zratio (81.0699) consistent with that value (within a 5 ppm accuracy) involves the generation of an allylic carbocation with the pentacyclic structure shown at the top and the bottom of Scheme2. This process might involve a retrocycloaddition occurring at Ring C, previously proposed in the literature [51], followed by the complete elimination of the SC mediated by a 1,3‐H transfer from C22 to C17 (see FigureS4). The mechanism suggests the location of positive charge on C17, a favourable position, since it corresponds to a tertiary carbocation, likely originated (like carbocations on the SC commented before) through an intramolecular hydride transfer, in this case occurring from C17 to the original location of positive charge, C3. As depicted in Scheme2, the positive charge on C17 enables a complete interpretation of the CHO and CHO‐d6fragmentation patterns, explaining the entire set of product ions labelled in the HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra reported in Figure3. A detailed representation of fragmentation steps leading to product ions reported in Scheme2is provided in FiguresS5,S6andS7of the Supporting Information.\n\n\n\nFragmentation pathways hypothesized for cholesterol and cholesterol hexa‐deuterated on methyl groups linked to C25 considering their [M + H‐H2O]+ions generated in the APCI source, with positive charge located on C17. Plain arrows indicate fragmentations observed in MS/MS spectra (under both HCD and CID conditions); dashed arrows indicate fragmentations observed in CID‐MS3/MS4spectra. Boxes include multiple product ions observed in a single MSn(n= 3, 4) spectrum. Exactm/zratios (rounded off to the fourth decimal place) are reported for all product ions.\n\nStructures for Ions T, S, R, Q, P and O, compatible with the 6 units shift in nominalm/zratio observed for them when CHO‐d6was fragmented, could be found by considering the progressive fragmentation of Rings A and B. As emphasized by one of the dashed arrows in Scheme2and in FigureS2, them/z265.2797 ion, belonging to Cluster P of deuterated CHO, was detected in the MS3spectrum of them/z293.3110 ion of Cluster R, thus facilitating its structural interpretation. Similarly, a complete set of product ions, enclosed in rectangular boxes in Scheme2, was observed in the respective MS3spectra of Ions T, S, R and Q reported in the scheme. The MS4spectra further highlighted the complex relationships existing between couples of product ions detected in those MS3spectra. For the sake of clarity, dashed arrows were not included inside those boxes in the case of Scheme2, but the respective transitions were carefully analysed to validate each structure shown in the scheme and are evidenced in the genealogical trees in FigureS2. Notably, a 28 Da neutral loss corresponding to the detachment of an ethylene molecule was very common, whereas a 14 Da neutral loss, putatively corresponding to a methylene loss, was rarely observed, although appearing consistent with the frequent detection of 14m/zunits‐spaced ions in MS3spectra (see FigureS2). For instance, them/z215.1794 ion (Cluster M) was never found in the fragmentation spectrum of them/z229.1951 one (Cluster N) but exhibited a relevant signal in the spectrum of the precursor atm/z243.2107 (Cluster O). On the other hand, methylene losses were inevitably hypothesized to occur from ions with exactm/z161.1325 and 135.1168 since they were inferred from the corresponding MS3spectra (see the second genealogical tree for the CHO‐d6precursor ion in FigureS2and the fragmentation shown at the top‐right side of FigureS6). The relationships found both upwards and downwards in the fragmentation cascades depicted in Schemes1and2and in FigureS2were very useful to formulate consistent structural hypotheses for each product ion, usually considering ring openings and H intramolecular transfers as the possible mechanisms.\n\nAs shown in Scheme2, the progressive fragmentation of the SC of Ions T, S, R and Q, with the immediate loss of the deuterated portion in the case of CHO‐d6, was critical to explain the 6‐unit shift inm/zratios observed only for ions of Clusters T to P in the MS/MS spectra reported in Figure3. Notably, among product ions generated in the case of CHO‐d6, those with exactm/z239.2640 and 253.2797, belonging to Clusters N and O, respectively, were not detected in any of the MS3or MS4spectra discussed so far (see the genealogical trees for CHO‐d6in FigureS2). This absence suggested that they were generated directly from the [M + H‐H2O]+precursor ion of CHO‐d6and still included the six D atoms. Consequently, their formation likely implied the fragmentation or the complete loss of Rings A and B, and possibly part of Ring C, but did not involve the SC, as depicted in the upper part of Scheme2and in the respective fragmentation processes in FigureS5. The corresponding nondeuterated ions, having exactm/zvalues of 233.2269 and 247.2426, respectively, were formed and detected in the HCD‐FTMS/MS spectrum when the [M + H‐H2O]+ion of CHO was fragmented. As highlighted in Scheme2, all peak signals in the other clusters displayed identicalm/zratios for CHO and CHO‐d6, excepting those in Clusters A and B, for the reasons previously explained (see Scheme1).\n\nThe location of the positive charge on C17 was also important to explain the generation of product ions with a relatively lowm/z(< 150) among them. Indeed, the ion with exactm/z123.1174 (corresponding to the major peak signal of Cluster F, see Figure3) was absent in all CHO‐related MS3spectra concerning Ions T, S, R and Q, but it was detected in the MS3spectrum of them/z257.2264 ion (a minor ion of Cluster P, not labelled in Figure3). Therefore, it was assumed to be formed from the latter, as described in the top‐right side of FigureS5. As shown in Scheme2and in FigureS5, the corresponding structure was compatible with the retainment of Ring D and part of Ring C, and the positive charge on C17 was a determining feature for its generation. This was also the case for the structure shown in the upper part of Scheme2for them/z109.1012 ion (Cluster E), that can be considered complementary to the one proposed in Scheme1. The positive charge on C17 was also important to provide an interpretation for product ions withm/z121.1012 and 81.0699, detected in Clusters F and C, respectively. As shown in Scheme2and FigureS2, these ions were detected both in 375 > 203 > and in 375 > 147 > MS3spectra and in 375 > 293 > 203 > and 375 > 293 > 147 > MS4spectra; thus, their direct precursors were ions withm/zratios of 203.1794 (Cluster L) and 147.1168 (Cluster H), and possible mechanisms for the respective generation from those precursors are reported in FiguresS6andS7. This finding supported the hypothesized chemical structures for the two ions and confirmed the structure previously hypothesized for them/z81.0699 ion. It is worth noting that the mechanism previously hypothesized for them/z81.0699 ion, reported in FigureS4, remains plausible, as the intermediate product ion of the process, that would have am/z199.2327 for CHO‐d6and 193.1956 for CHO (see FigureS1), was detected in the respective HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra, although with very low intensity (they were not labelled withm/zratios in Figure3). This consideration can be extended to other product ions as well. As exemplified in FigureS8, them/z215.1794 ion of Cluster M might be explained also with a cycloelimination on Ring D occurring directly on the [M + H‐H2O]+ions of both CHO and CHO‐d6, assuming the typical positive charge location on C3. Although the final structure would be the same reported in Scheme1, this pathway would not explain the relationship with them/z243.2107 ion, inferred from MS3and MS4spectra (see FigureS2). The potential occurrence of multiple pathways leading to certain product ions can be thus considered a typical feature of the complex fragmentation processes involving CHO and other sterols.\n\nAs discussed in detail in the following sections, the careful interpretation of these complex fragmentation pathways allowed for the explanation of subtle differences in the fragmentation profiles observed for typical plant sterols with slightly different structures, paving the way for identifying general structure–fragmentation relationships.\n\nAs evidenced in Figure1, campesterol and β‐sitosterol, two of the most significant PSs, are closely related to CHO in terms of molecular structure, since they include the same steroidal backbone (with a C=C bond between C5 and C6) and a completely saturated SC. The only structural difference lies in the presence of a methyl or ethyl group attached to C24, respectively. Therefore, the general similarity observed for APCI(+)‐HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra of CHO, campesterol and β‐sitosterol (see Figures3and4) is not surprising. Specifically, the profiles of Ion Clusters D through M were nearly identical for the three sterols, with them/z147.1166 ion (Cluster H, exactm/z147.1168) consistently appearing as the base peak in the MS/MS spectrum. This similarity is reasonable only if all product ions related to those clusters do not include the SC, as proposed in Schemes1and2.\n\nHowever, subtle but significant differences were recognized in other clusters. For instance, an increase was observed for the ion of Cluster C with nominalm/z85 in the case of β‐sitosterol (it was not labelled in Figure4for clarity). As depicted in Scheme3and in FigureS9, this finding aligns with the generation of a tertiary carbocation, similar to the one atm/z57.0699 depicted on the right side of Scheme1but modified by the presence of the ethyl moiety linked to C24 (exactm/z85.1012).\n\n\n\nStructures hypothesized for product ions detected in the HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra of the [M + H‐H2O]+ions of β‐sitosterol, campesterol, isofucosterol (Δ5‐avenasterol) and Δ7‐avenasterol and recognized as relevant in the assessment of specific structural features of the four phytosterols. The location of the positive charge required to explain the final structures is indicated for each (group of) product ion(s). See text for details.\n\nScheme3further illustrates that when a methyl or ethyl group is attached to C24, the latter becomes another stable location for the positive charge on the SC, like C25, as it corresponds to a tertiary carbocation. Accordingly, pathways leading to product ions with exactm/z57.0699, 71.0855 and 85.1012 can be easily hypothesized both for campesterol and β‐sitosterol by placing the positive charge on C24 or C25 (see FigureS9). As for product ions with a highm/zratio, a significant difference in relative abundance was found for the ion of cluster N detected atm/z233.2258 for CHO (see Figure3), which was nearly undetectable for campesterol and β‐sitosterol (see Figure4). This finding further supports the structure hypothesized for that ion in Scheme2. Indeed, the methylation/ethylation of C24 would lead to a 14/28‐unit shift in the nominalm/zratio of this product ion in the case of campesterol and β‐sitosterol, explaining why signals at nominalm/z247 (O) and 261 (P) were observed in the corresponding MS/MS spectra (see Figure4A,B). To maintain clarity, these two signals were not labelled with theirm/zratios in the figure. A similar reasoning applies to them/z247 ion (O) of CHO, which also includes the SC (see Scheme2) and was thus shifted to nominalm/zvalues of 261 for campesterol (Cluster P, not labelled in Figure4A) and 275 in the case of β‐sitosterol (Cluster Q, see Figure4B). Despite exhibiting a low intensity, the latter signal can be considered a diagnostic product ion of β‐sitosterol among Δ5‐sterols with a saturated SC.\n\nAnother remarkable difference between the two sterols and CHO was found in Cluster P, where them/z257 ion prevailed over them/z259 one, thus reversing the abundance ratio observed for CHO (see Figures3and4A,B). As described in Scheme1and FigureS3, them/z257 ion (exact value 257.2264) might result from the complete elimination of the SC from the CHO precursor ion having its charge on C3 through a 1,3 H migration already proposed by Müngeret al. [48]. An alternative mechanism, illustrated in FigureS10, might explain why the resulting product ion was more abundant in the case of campesterol and β‐sitosterol. Specifically, a concerted process [51], involving a six‐membered transition state with a 1,5‐H transfer from C24 to C17 could be hypothesized. As shown in FigureS10, this process would lead to the detachment of a propene molecule and of an alkene with double substitution (by an isopropyl group and by a methyl or ethyl group) on one of the carbon atoms involved in the C=C bond (C24) rather than the single substitution observed on that atom in the case of CHO.\n\nAs for other differences observed between CHO and campesterol/β‐sitosterol, the counterparts of CHO product ions belonging to Clusters P, Q, R, S and T shown in Scheme2were detected in Clusters Q/R, R/S, S/T, T/U and U/V, respectively, for campesterol/β‐sitosterol (see Figure4A,B), in accordance with the 14/28 Da shift occurring on the SC of these sterols. Notably, as shown by the genealogical trees reported for CHO, campesterol and β‐sitosterol in FigureS2, the MS3spectra obtained for the corresponding ions detected in the respective MS/MS spectra displayed the same set of product ions, thus emphasizing the similarity between them, apart from the SC. These findings indirectly supported the structural hypotheses made in Scheme2for CHO Product Ions P, Q, R, S and T, which, as discussed before, are also consistent with the results obtained for CHO‐d6.\n\nThe comparison between MS/MS spectra of CHO, campesterol and β‐sitosterol highlights the critical role played by the positive charge location on C17 in the fragmentation pathways of the respective [M + H‐H2O]+ions. It suggests that product ions including the entire SC, havingm/zratio values close to that of the precursor ion, may enable the distinction between the three sterols. Additionally, an increase in product ions detected at nominalm/z85 (Cluster C) and 275 (Cluster Q) was observed for β‐sitosterol.\n\nBoth stigmasterol and brassicasterol, which are two further significant plant sterols, possess a C=C bond between C22 and C23 along their SC (see Figure1). This feature is expected to influence their fragmentation patterns, thus potentially leading to differences with respect to sterols discussed so far in this study. By analogy with CHO, isotopically labelled stigmasterol including five D atoms on the ethyl group linked to C24 was analysed during this study to recognize product ions including the terminal part of the SC. The APCI(+)‐FTMS/MS spectra of [M + H‐H2O]+ions for stigmasterol and stigmasterol‐d5(having exactm/zvalues 395.3672 and 400.3986) are compared in Figure5. Product ion clusters are labelled as in previous spectra, withm/zratios referred to deuterated product ions reported in red. A detailed list of experimentalm/zvalues, molecular formulas inferred from them and relative abundances for all product ions detected in the two spectra is provided in TableS2of the Supporting Information using the same code adopted in the case of TableS1to markm/zratios.\n\n\n\nAPCI(+)‐HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra referred to [M + H‐H2O]+ions of stigmasterol (Plot A) and stigmasterol completely deuterated on the ethyl group linked to C24 (stigmasterol‐d5, Plot B), having exactm/zvalues 395.3672 and 400.3986, respectively. Ions sharing the same number of C atoms but differing in the number of H and/or D atoms were grouped within a single cluster, indicated by a capital letter. The MS/MS spectrum of stigmasterol‐d5(Plot B)m/zvalues related to ions including D atoms were reported in red. See text for details. The NL numbers represent normalization levels (measured as counts/s) related to each spectrum.\n\nComparing Figures3and5clearly reveals that product ions in clusters from D to I had the samem/zratios for both CHO and stigmasterol, as well as their deuterated derivatives. This finding supports the structures proposed in Schemes1and/or2for those ions, as none of them involve the SC, where CHO and stigmasterol differ from each other and each of them differs from its isotopically labelled counterpart. Conversely, differences between CHO and stigmasterol were observed for Clusters A, B and C, thus confirming that they are directly related to the terminal part of the SC (see Scheme1). As illustrated in SchemeS1, which compares the structures proposed for relevant product ions of stigmasterol and stigmasterol‐d5, and in FigureS11, where pathways hypothesized for their formation are reported, most product ions in those clusters can be explained by considering the positive charge on C24. Indeed, this position corresponds to a carbocation that is both tertiary and allylic in the case of stigmasterol. Interestingly, the same structure could be hypothesized for them/z69.0699 ion in the case of CHO and stigmasterol (see Schemes1andS1). In fact, this ion results from the loss of the ethyl chain linked to C24 (see FigureS11), where D atoms are located, and which is absent in the case of CHO. On the other hand, them/z83.0855 ion observed for stigmasterol can be explained by three possible structures, all corresponding to stable allylic (in one case also tertiary) carbocations. This interpretation may account for its role as the base peak in the HCD‐FTMS/MS spectrum of stigmasterol (see Figure5A) and highlights this ion as a distinctive marker for the presence of a C=C bond between C22 and C23 and of the ethyl moiety linked to C24. As evidenced in SchemeS1and FigureS11, one of the structures proposed for them/z83.0855 ion was confirmed by the detection of its penta‐deuterated counterpart atm/z88.1169, while the other two were supported by the detection of a tetra‐deuterated product ion atm/z87.1106 and a tris‐deuterated product ion atm/z86.1044 in the MS/MS spectrum of stigmasterol‐d5(see Figure5B, where the peak signals of these ions, in Cluster C, were not labelled with theirm/zratios for the sake of clarity).\n\nIt is worth noting that two previous studies reported the detection of am/z83 ion in EI‐MS [58] or MS/MS spectra [59] of stigmasterol, both suggesting structures lacking the ethyl moiety linked to C24.\n\nHowever, the analysis of stigmasterol deuterated on that group suggests that a different pathway likely generates the ion, at least under conditions related to the so‐called HCD mode. Moreover, as inferred from Figure5Band TableS2, a non‐negligible peak signal was detected for stigmasterol‐d5at am/zratio consistent with the exact value 85.0950 (see TableS2), indicating the generation of a further product ion including four D atoms. As illustrated at the bottom of FigureS11, the structure proposed for this ion would imply the original transfer of a deuteride (instead of a hydride) from C24′ to the original location of positive charge (C3), resulting in a positive charge on C24′. In principle, a further structure for them/z83.0855 ion (not reported in SchemeS1) would be possible for nondeuterated stigmasterol, according to the same pathway.\n\nAs mentioned before, comparing CHO and stigmasterol MS/MS spectra (see Figures3and5) revealed significant differences in detectedm/zratios beginning from Cluster J and extending to those with higherm/zratios. These differences can mostly be explained considering product ions previously described for CHO in Scheme2. Indeed, T, S, R and P ions and them/z247 ion of Cluster O described in Scheme2, all including the entire SC, correspond, respectively, to the single ions detected in Clusters V and U and to the minor ions in Clusters T, R and Q (those having nominalm/zvalues 313, 285 and 273) in the case of stigmasterol. The shifts of +26 units in nominalm/zratios are due to the presence of the ethyl group on C24 and the C=C bond between C22 and C23 (see SchemeS1). As expected, the penta‐deuterated counterparts of those five ions were detected in the MS/MS spectrum of stigmasterol‐d5(see red labelledm/zratios in Figure4Band the related structures in SchemeS1). As emphasized in SchemeS1, the positive charge of these ions is likely located on C24, as this is both a tertiary and an allylic carbon in the case of stigmasterol. However, charge remote fragmentations proposed to explain all the five product ions in the case of CHO (with the positive charge located on C17), involving Rings A and/or B of the steroidal backbone, were confirmed (see Schemes2andS1). A detailed representation of fragmentation processes hypothesized to explain the structures of stigmasterol and stigmasterol‐d5product ions reported in SchemeS1and havingm/z> 100 and the positive charge on C24 or C17 is provided, respectively, in FiguresS12andS13of the Supporting Information.\n\nRemarkably, none of the other relevant peak signals detected in clusters from J to T in the case of stigmasterol showed the 5‐unit shift related to the deuteration of the ethyl group in the case of stigmasterol‐d5, indicating the absence of that moiety in their structure. Among them, them/z311 ion of Cluster T and them/z241 ion of Cluster O represented the stigmasterol counterparts of them/z313 and 243 ions proposed for CHO in Schemes1and2, respectively, considering the presence of a C=C bond between C22 and C23 (see SchemeS1). Conversely, structures identical to those proposed for ions with nominalm/z95, 109, 135, 147, 161 and 215 in the case of CHO could be hypothesized for stigmasterol (see Schemes1,2andS1), as the portion of SC differing between the two molecules was absent in their structure.\n\nA more complex evaluation was needed for the remaining product ions detected in the stigmasterol MS/MS spectrum and not showing the expected +5‐unit shift when stigmasterol‐d5was fragmented. Firstly, 395 > 297 > and 400 > 297 > CID‐MS3spectra were acquired by fragmenting them/z297 ion (Cluster S) originated by both stigmasterol and stigmasterol‐d5[M + H‐H2O]+ions. As evidenced in the genealogical trees reported for them/z400.4 ion and for them/z395.4 ion of stigmasterol in FigureS2, both spectra revealed the same features, that is, a series of signals with 14‐units spaced nominalm/zvalues from 269 to 135. As proposed in FigureS14, them/z297 ion (exact value 297.2577) might be generated through a two‐step gas phase process. The first step would involve a cycloelimination, enabled by the C=C bond between C22 and C23 in the stigmasterol SC, with loss of propene; this would be followed by the loss of but‐1‐ene, eventually penta‐deuterated. Additionally, if the positive charge was initially located on C17, as shown in FigureS14, a very stable tertiary/allylic carbocation would finally be formed, thus explaining the significant abundance of them/z297 ion in the MS/MS spectrum of stigmasterol and of its deuterated counterpart (see Figure5). Nonetheless, the same mechanism might occur considering the positive charge on C3, as shown in FigureS15, and the resulting ion, indicated as 297.2577 A in SchemeS1, would coincide with them/z297 ion proposed by Münger et al. [48] as a typical feature of fragmentation for sterols with a C=C bond between C22 and C23, although a different mechanism was hypothesized by those authors. In the present study, the 395 > 297 > and 400 > 297 > CID‐MS3spectra clarified that the entire set of stigmasterol product ions mentioned earlier was preferentially generated by them/z297 ion, as emphasized in the right side of SchemeS1. The detailed fragmentation processes hypothesized for those ions, shown in FigureS15, suggested that even a further structure (297.2577 B in SchemeS1) had to be considered for them/z297 ion with the positive charge on C3 to enable an easier interpretation of all the detected product ions. Notably, them/z255 ion (Cluster P), indicated by Münger et al. [48] as a characteristic product ion arising directly from the [M + H‐H2O]+ions of sterols having a C=C bond between C22 and C23 and another one on the steroidal backbone, was included among them.\n\nIn the case of stigmasterol, a general agreement between structures hypothesized for product ions could be made, at least for the nondeuterated sterol, between the present study and the one by Jiang et al. [30], in which the quadrupole‐Orbitrap mass spectrometer was also used. One of the relevant differences was the absence, in the fragmentation scheme proposed by those authors, of product ions still keeping the SC (i.e., ion of clusters from Q to V reported on the right side of SchemeS1), although peak signals potentially corresponding to some of them seemed to be present in the FTMS/MS spectrum reported in Ref. [30]. On the other hand, product ions withm/z< 100 were not considered by the authors since 100 was the lowestm/zvalue explored in their spectrum. As discussed so far in this paper, those lowm/zproduct ions can be very important to clarify the structural characteristics of the SC of sterols; thus, they should be included in the acquired MS/MS spectra of sterols, if possible.\n\nFollowing stigmasterol, brassicasterol, that is, another Δ5‐sterol including a C=C bond between C22 and C23 and differing from stigmasterol only for the presence of a methyl group, instead of an ethyl one, linked to C24, was examined. This structural similarity is evident in the APCI(+)‐HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra of the respective [M + H‐H2O]+ions, reported in Figures4Cand5A, at least for product ions that did not include the SC portion where the structural difference occurs, namely, all those corresponding to clusters from D to P and them/z297 one (Cluster S, see SchemeS1). Among product ions with higherm/zratios, brassicasterol ions with nominalm/zvalues 325 (U), 311 (T) and 271 (Q) correspond, respectively, to Ions V, U and R detected for stigmasterol (see SchemeS1).\n\nThe most notable differences between brassicasterol and stigmasterol spectra were observed for lowerm/zproduct ions, particularly those of Clusters B and C. Indeed, the prevailing product ion observed at nominalm/z83 for stigmasterol (see SchemeS1) became them/z69 ion in the case of brassicasterol due to the replacement of the ethyl group with methyl at C24. Accordingly, them/z69 ion was the most abundant product ion detected for brassicasterol, making it a diagnostic feature to recognize the presence of a methyl group linked to C24 in conjunction with a double bond between C22 and C23.\n\nAs illustrated in Figure1, isofucosterol (Δ5‐avenasterol) and Δ7‐avenasterol are isomeric sterols sharing an ethylidene group linked to C24 and differing only for the position of the double bond on Ring B. These compounds were thus studied to evaluate if the different position of that C=C bond might influence sterol fragmentation pathways. The APCI(+)‐HCD‐FTMS/MS spectra for the respective [M + H‐H2O]+ions (exactm/z395.3672) are reported in Figure4D,E. It is important to note that the presence of a C=C bond between carbon atoms C24 and C24′ may favour the localization of positive charge on C25, C23 and C24″, as these would all be allylic carbocations. As shown in Scheme3and FiguresS16andS17, the positive charge on C23 (corresponding to an allylic/secondary carbocation) and on C25 (an allylic/tertiary carbocation) enables an easy interpretation of product ions detected, respectively, atm/z69.0708 and 83.0861 (consistent with exact values 69.0699 and 83.0855) for the two sterols (see Figure4D,E), when considering SC dissociations. However, due to the significantly higher abundance of them/z83.0861 ion in the case of Δ7‐avenasterol, an alternative interpretation was searched for. As a result, the process shown in FigureS18was proposed. Specifically, it involves the preliminary breakage of the C10–C9 bond, mediated by a 1,3 H transfer from C11 to C10 (and the formation of a C=C bond between C9 and C11), followed by the detachment from Ring A of a pentacyclic secondary carbocation with an exactm/z83.0855 and the release of a neutral molecule with an extended C=C bond conjugation. As inferred from FigureS18, this process requires the absence of a C=C bond between C5 and C6, thus explaining why it would be favoured in the case of Δ7‐avenasterol. For the same reason, the process is expected to be hindered also in the case of stigmasterol, thus explaining why them/z83 peak signal was very low in the case of stigmasterol‐d5(see Figure5B). In this case, the specific structure of them/z83 ion proposed for stigmasterol was formed but including the deuterated portion of the molecule, thus leading to a set of product ions with nominalm/zvalues ranging from 85 to 88 (see the upper‐right side of SchemeS1).\n\nExcepting a higher abundance of them/z95 ion in Cluster D for Δ7‐avenasterol, due to the possibility of direct generation from Ring A (see the structure shown in Scheme3and the fragmentation reported in FigureS17), a similar internal abundance distribution was observed for the product ions of clusters from D to G and Cluster I in the case of isofucosterol and Δ7‐avenasterol, with a good accordance also with the corresponding clusters observed for stigmasterol (see Figures4and5A). This result is reasonable, as the three sterols share the same molecular formula (C29H48O), and aligns with the structures proposed for ions of those clusters in Schemes1and2, referred to CHO but also valid for stigmasterol. The shift of the C=C bond from C5–C6 to C7–C8 would still make those structures consistent with the experimentalm/zratios. However, this is not the case of the structure proposed for the important product ion with exactm/z147.1168 (Cluster H) discussed before. As evidenced in Scheme3and FigureS17, the presence of a C=C bond between C7 and C8 would favour the generation of a product ion with exactm/z149.1325 in the case of Δ7‐avenasterol, through a different mechanism involving a bond breakage between Rings A and B and Ring C. This hypothesis was experimentally confirmed, as the prevailing peak signal for Cluster H was detected atm/z149.1323 in the case of Δ7‐avenasterol (see Figure4), making it a diagnostic product ion for the C=C bond location between C7 and C8.\n\nCharacteristic differences in relative abundances were observed for further signal clusters when comparing isofucosterol, Δ7‐avenasterol and stigmasterol, starting from Cluster J. In the case of isofucosterol and Δ7‐avenasterol, a signal with anm/zratio compatible with the exact value 175.1481 was predominant, whereas a signal compatible with the exactm/zvalue 173.1324 showed the highest abundance for stigmasterol. As shown in Scheme3, the structure proposed in Scheme1for them/z175 ion, with the positive charge located on C3, would be valid for both isofucosterol and Δ7‐avenasterol. In contrast, the structure having an exactm/zratio of 173.1324 proposed for stigmasterol in SchemeS1would necessarily require the presence of a C=C bond between C5 and C6. A higher abundance can thus be predicted for this product ion also in the case of isofucosterol, compared to Δ7‐avenasterol, although it does not become more abundant than them/z175.1481 ion. This hypothesis was confirmed by the MS/MS spectra of the two compounds (see Figure4). It is worth noting that an alternative structure was proposed for them/z175 ion in the case of CHO, with the positive charge located on C17 and involving the breakage of the C20–C22 bond (see Scheme2). This structure is essential to explain the characteristic abundance of this product ion observed for sterols lacking a C=C bond between C22 and C23, namely, CHO, campesterol, β‐sitosterol, isofucosterol and Δ7‐avenasterol (see Figures3and4), and its low abundance for sterols including that C=C bond, namely, stigmasterol and brassicasterol (see Figures4Cand5). The breakage of the C20–C22 bond leading to them/z175 ion with positive charge on C17 requires a 1,3 H transfer from C23 to C20. This process is significantly more difficult if C23 is involved in a C=C bond, as in stigmasterol and brassicasterol.\n\nWhile comparing further product ions obtained for isofucosterol and Δ7‐avenasterol, an interesting inversion in abundance was observed for ions with nominalm/zvalues of 187 and 189 in Cluster K. As illustrated in Scheme3, this finding can be explained by the easier generation of them/z187 ion in the case of isofucosterol since the C5–C6 double bond is already present and an additional C=C bond is formed between C8 and C14 during fragmentation (see FigureS16). Similar internal patterns were generally observed for clusters from L to V for the two species (see Figure4), the only differences being an increased abundance of them/z215, 257 and 297 ions in the case of Δ7‐avenasterol. This finding aligns with the structures reported for ions in those clusters in Schemes1,2andS1, as the position of the C=C bond on Ring B is not expected to affect their validity. On the other hand, the increased abundance of the three specific ions cited before suggests that the C=C bond between C7 and C8 can positively influence their generation due to the different molecular conformation induced by that position. More generally, this conformational effect might also explain the higher relative abundance of product ions with respect to the residual precursor ion observed for Δ7‐avenasterol compared to isofucosterol (see Figure4).\n\nThe interpretation of fragmentation spectra for 4‐desmethyl sterols discussed in the previous sections revealed subtle differences despite their general similarity. These differences might help in identifying the occurrence of specific structural features. This idea is highlighted by the comparison of relative intensities typically observed for all product ions related to the sterols considered during the present study, reported in TableS3of the Supporting Information.\n\nTable1summarizes the most informative product ions, linking specific structural features to intensity relationships or percent intensities, based on the fragmentation spectra. This table might be employed to assess structural features like the position of the double bond on Ring B, the presence of a double bond on the SC (either between C22 and C23 or on the branch linked to C24) and the occurrence of an alkyl group linked to C24 by carefully considering the intensity ratios existing between peak signals in specific clusters or, in some cases, the relative intensity in the entire spectrum.\n\nSummary of correlations between specific structural features and intensity relationships for the most structurally informative product ions of 4‐desmethyl‐sterols, grouped according to clusters shown in Figures3,4and5.\n\nNote:The correlations are based on HCD‐FTMS/MS and CID‐MSn(n= 2–4) analyses of selected standards. Exactm/zvalues rounded to four decimal places are reported. Percentages correspond to relative intensities observed in the MS/MS spectrum.\n\nCombining this information with the precursor ionm/zratio and the differences inm/zratios observed between its peak signal and nearby signals in the MS/MS spectrum, reflecting neutral losses occurring on the SC, might aid in identifying unknown plant sterols in vegetal samples.\n\nThe complex fragmentation patterns obtained for 4‐desmethyl‐sterols when subjected to positive ion MS/MS were thoroughly analysed using natural and isotopically labelled standard compounds. The study employed a complementary approach using accuratem/zvalues of MS/MS peak signals provided by a high‐resolution mass spectrometer, insights gained from multistage mass spectrometry (MS3–MS4) using a linear ion trap and comparisons of product ionm/zratios between natural and isotopically labelled standards. The intricate nature of 4‐desmethyl‐sterols MS/MS spectra was found to arise from a combination of factors, the most relevant being the existence of multiple potential locations for the positive charge, which, to the best of our knowledge, was evidenced for the first time for sterols. This feature was likely caused by the occurrence of unique intramolecular hydride transfers that displaced the positive charge of the original carbocation formed during the APCI process upon protonation of the OH group and subsequent loss of a H2O molecule, thus located on the carbon atom conventionally numbered as C3. In particular, indirect evidence was obtained for an alternative location of positive charge on carbon atoms conventionally labelled as C17, on the steroidal backbone, and C24/C25, on the side chain, due to their stabilization as tertiary carbocations. As a result, multiple fragmentation pathways were proposed to account for all detected product ions, with some ions possibly having several structures consistent with theirm/zratios. The investigation highlighted the important role played by low (< 100)m/zproduct ions, mainly arising from the side chain, and by product ions generated from the sterol [M + H‐H2O]+precursor ions through small neutral losses occurring from that chain, related to C‐C bond breakages. Despite they had not received a specific attention in previous studies, those ions proved very useful to infer the structural characteristics of the side chain (location of the C=C bond, nature of the substitution at C24). Indeed, significant correlations were found between the intensity ratios of selected product ions among them and the characteristics of the SC. Other diagnostic correlations between intensity ratios or percent intensities and structural features were found for product ions whose generation was influenced by the position of the C=C bond on Ring B.\n\nThese insights provide a foundation for identifying unknown sterols in complex samples, such as plant extracts, and might thus contribute to a deeper understanding of this important class of metabolites.\n\nV.

Despite this, the pressure that footwear exerts at the medial forefoot has not been fully evaluated in people with HV. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether the toe box of footwear habitually worn by women with HV is associated with pressure exerted on the medial forefoot.\n\nIn‐shoe peak pressure and maximum force at the medial forefoot (distal and proximal sites) were recorded from 28 women (mean age 60.7 years, SD 10.7) with moderate or severe HV using the pedar pad pressure system (Novel GmbH, Germany). The shape (width and area) of the participants' most symptomatic foot and toe‐box of their usual footwear was determined using an INFOOT 3D laser scanner (I‐Ware Laboratory, Japan) and hand tracing, respectively. The difference between the foot and corresponding footwear measurements as well as differences in the magnitude and timing of peak pressure and maximum force between the proximal and distal forefoot were determined using independentt‐tests. Correlations between forefoot pressures with toe‐box differential were determined using Spearman'sρanalyses.\n\nPeak pressure and maximum force were significantly greater (mean difference [MD] = 33.0 ± 15.4 kPa;p< 0.001 and 12.8 ± 7.3 N;p= 0.001) and occurred slightly later in the stance phase at the distal forefoot compared to the proximal forefoot (MD = 6.0 ± 6.9%;p= 0.083 and 6.9 ± 6.8%;p= 0.045, respectively). There were no significant correlations between toe‐box differential and medial forefoot pressures, with all correlations less than 0.35 (p> 0.05).\n\nToe‐box shape and fit of footwear typically worn by older women with painful HV was not associated with increased medial forefoot pressures in this study sample. Therefore, changing the toe‐box width and area of the usual footwear worn by older women with painful, moderate or severe HV may not necessarily reduce medial forefoot pressures where footwear does not appear to play a role.\n\nKeywords:biomechanics, forefoot, hallux valgus, human, pressure, shoes\n\nHallux valgus (HV) is a common foot condition characterised by the medial deviation of the first metatarsal and lateral deviation of the hallux, resulting in progressive subluxation of the first metatarsophalangeal joint and a medial prominence of the forefoot [1]. The prevalence of HV is greater among females and is estimated at 23% in adults and 36% in older adults (aged over 65 years), indicating an increase with age [2]. HV is associated with reduced hallux strength [3,4], impaired balance [5,6] and increased risk of falls [7,8]. Both general and foot‐related quality of life progressively decline with increasing HV severity [9,10].\n\nIll‐fitting footwear is a potentially modifiable risk factor for HV [11,12]. Between 63% and 72% of people wear inappropriately sized footwear and are consequently more likely to have foot pain and foot disorders [13]. The primary footwear feature implicated in HV development is a narrow toe box (the section of footwear that surrounds the toes), particularly among women [14,15]. Moreover, among women, the development of HV is significantly associated with the use of a narrow toe box between the ages of 20–39 years [11]. This suggests that footwear commonly worn by people who develop HV does not follow the contour of the forefoot and that the toes may adapt to footwear shape, thereby contributing to the onset and progression of the deformity.\n\nDespite several studies examining plantar pressures associated with HV [16], only one study has investigated the effect of the toe‐box shape on medial forefoot pressures in women with HV [17]. This study reported no significant difference in peak pressures at the medial first metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal joint with round toe‐box footwear compared to participants' own footwear. However, the shape of participants' own footwear was not reported in this study. Two studies have investigated medial forefoot pressures among other populations and, in contrast, found a relationship between the toe‐box shape and medial forefoot pressures [18,19]. Among women without HV, peak pressures at the medial first metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal joints were significantly reduced when wearing footwear with a round toe box compared to a square or pointed toe box [19]. Similarly, among both men and women with foot pain, peak pressures at the medial first metatarsophalangeal joint were significantly reduced when wearing footwear with a round, wide toe box compared to participants' own footwear [18].\n\nThe contrast between populations with and without HV indicates that there is still little understanding of the relationship between toe‐box shape and medial forefoot pressures in HV, although individuals with HV are known to have difficulty with finding comfortable footwear [4]. In addition, all three studies collected pressure data by securing discrete sensors to predetermined locations on the foot with an adhesive tape [17,18,19]. Limitations of this method of data collection are the possibility of sensor placement error [20] and movement of the sensor during data collection.\n\nEvidence for a relationship between toe‐box shape and fit and medial forefoot pressures in HV is limited and suggests that further investigation is necessary to better understand interventions for the prevention and management of HV pain and deformity. The objectives of this study were therefore to (i) quantify in‐shoe pressures at the distal and proximal medial forefoot (corresponding to the first interphalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints) in women with HV using a novel matrix pressure sensor and (ii) examine the association between these pressures and forefoot toe‐box differential. We hypothesised that there would be a positive association between first interphalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joint pressures and forefoot toe‐box differential, indicating that the wearing of relatively narrow shoes would increase medial pressures.\n\nThis cross‐sectional study was nested within a randomised feasibility trial for the effectiveness of a multifaceted non‐surgical intervention for HV. The data were collected during the baseline assessment for this trial. A protocol of the trial and the main findings have been published [21,22,23]. Reporting of this study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines [24]. Ethical approval was granted by the La Trobe University Human Ethics Committee (reference HEC20474). Informed written consent was obtained from all participants. The feasibility trial was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN12621000645853).\n\nParticipants were recruited using posters in the local community, email correspondence to staff of the La Trobe University School of Allied Health, Human Services and Sport, postal invitation to patients of the La Trobe University Health Sciences Clinic and Facebook advertising targeting women in the local area with painful HV and offering treatment free of charge. Inclusion criteria were (i) female, (ii) ≥ 40 years of age, (iii) first metatarsophalangeal or interphalangeal joint pain rated three out of 10 on a zero to 10‐point scale for at least 12 weeks, (iv) HV scored two or more on the Manchester scale [25] equating to moderate or severe HV, (v) capability to ambulate household distances greater than 50m without walking aid and (vi) ability to understand verbal and written English. Exclusion criteria were a history of (i) HV surgery, (ii) neurological disease impacting ambulation, (iii) inflammatory rheumatological conditions (e.g., gout, psoriatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis), (iv) lower limb or partial foot amputation, (v) lower limb or back injury that interferes with reaching the feet or (vi) treatment with arch‐contouring orthoses or foot exercises (stretching, mobilisation and strengthening) in the last 12 weeks. The decision to recruit solely women was due to their higher prevalence of HV [2] and tendency to wear narrow footwear [13].\n\nThe sample size was determined by the feasibility trial, which did not require full power to detect statistically significant differences between groups. The recommended sample size for feasibility and pilot trials is 12 participants per group [26]. Twenty‐eight participants were recruited to account for a 15% drop‐out rate. The sample of 28 was sufficient to detect a correlation between toe box shape and fit and medial pressures of at least 0.22 (significance level 0.05, power 0.80) [27].\n\nA structured interview was conducted to collect data on participant demographic characteristics (age, education level, ethnicity, primary medical conditions and medications used), anthropometrics (height, weight and body mass index [BMI]), general health and foot health (Short Form 12 questionnaire [28], Incidental and Planned Exercise Questionnaire [29] and the Manchester–Oxford Foot Questionnaire) [30] and clinical features (severity of HV deformity, side affected, pain duration and pain severity) [21,22].\n\nTo document foot dimensions, an INFOOT 3D laser scanner (I‐Ware Laboratory, Japan) was used. Scans were taken in a weight‐bearing position, with the weight evenly distributed between each foot. Participants could use an upright bar for support if required. The INFOOT 3D laser scanner has been validated against radiographs and clinical measurements and found to be reliable for the majority of parameters [28]. From these scans, an outline of participants' feet was produced as a vector image. Forefoot width was defined as the length of a line connecting the most medial point of the first metatarsophalangeal joint and the most lateral point of the fifth metatarsophalangeal joint and forefoot area was defined as the area created by the footprint from this line to the distal end of the longest digit.\n\nParticipants were asked to bring the closed‐toe footwear they wore most often. To document toe‐box shape, an outline of each shoe's sole was traced onto blank paper and scanned in a flat‐bed scanner. If the outsole was appreciably wider than the upper of the shoe, the outline was adjusted to approximate the true upper dimensions using a visual estimate after tracing was completed. This method has been successfully used in a previous study [15]. Toe‐box width was defined as the length of a line connecting the most medial point of the forefoot of the shoe and the most lateral point of the forefoot of the shoe, and the toe‐box area was defined as the area created by the outline of the shoe from this line to the distal end of the shoe. To compare foot and footwear shapes, a vector image of the participants' footwear was superimposed over a vector image of the participant's foot using Canvas 11 (ACD Systems, Miami, FL, USA). See Figure1. To quantify the difference in shape (referred to as the toe‐box differential), two measurements were taken: first, the difference in width at the level of the metatarsophalangeal joints (hereafter referred to as forefoot width differential); second, the difference in area taken between the level of the metatarsophalangeal joints and the distal end of the longest digit (hereafter referred to as forefoot area differential).\n\n\n\nThree‐dimensional foot scan superimposed with a shoe scan. See text for explanation.\n\nIn this study, we defined ‘medial forefoot’ as two masks corresponding to the first metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal joints and measured these using the pedar pad (Novel GmbH, Munich, Germany), a flexible strap of 56 sensors with an active area of 70 mm × 160 mm and resolution of 0.5 sensors/cm2. The pedar pad is a novel device but uses the same pressure distribution measuring system as the pedar‐X, which has previously been found to be a valid, reliable and accurate measure of in‐shoe pressures [31]. Once the strap was secured to the foot as shown in Figure2, and the participant's shoes were fastened, the pedar pad was zeroed by asking participants to raise their foot. Participants then completed four 6‐m walking trials at a self‐selected speed. Following the trials, it was checked that the pedar pad remained in place. If the participant had bilateral HV, the foot with the greater symptomatic severity was used. To minimise the confounding effect of variability in walking speed on the pressure data, a trial was repeated if the walking speed differed by more than 5% of the original trial. The middle four steps from each trial (i.e., a total of 16 steps) were used for analysis to prevent acceleration and deceleration from influencing the data. Sixteen steps has been shown to provide reliable measurements [31]. Plantar pressure data were averaged within the pedar pad Novel scientific software, and peak pressure (defined as the highest pressure value recorded in a mask region, measured in kPa) and maximum force (defined as the highest force value recorded in a mask region, measured in N) were documented. The sensor area was divided into two mask regions: mask 1 (distal forefoot, which included two rows of sensors and corresponded to the first interphalangeal joint) and mask 2 (proximal forefoot, which included three rows of sensors and corresponded to the first metatarsophalangeal joint).\n\n\n\nPedar pad placement in footwear during walking trials.\n\nStatistical analysis was undertaken using IBM SPSS Statistics version 26.0 (IBM Corp, NY, USA). All data were explored for normality. Differences between distal and proximal peak pressure and maximum force were compared using independent samplest‐tests. Associations of distal and proximal forefoot peak pressure and maximum force with the forefoot width and area differential were investigated using the Spearman's rho (ρ) correlation coefficient. The following interpretation of correlations was used: 0 to 0.25 indicated little or no relationship, > 0.25 to 0.50 indicated a fair relationship, > 0.50 to 0.75 indicated a moderate to good relationship and > 0.75 indicated a good to excellent relationship [32]. In all analyses,p< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Individual peak pressure and maximum force recordings were time‐normalised using code written in R software incorporating linear interpolation and then graphed using Canvas 11 (ACD Systems, Miami, FL, USA) to analyse timing over the stance phase.\n\nA total of 28 participants were recruited for the pilot and feasibility trial and all were included in this study. Participant characteristics are shown in Table1. The group had a mean (SD) age of 60.7 (10.7) years and BMI of 27.2 (4.2) kg/m2. The most frequent ethnicity of participants was Oceanic/Australian (n= 13, 46%). Most participants displayed bilateral HV (n= 23, 82%) and at least moderate deformity (moderaten= 19, 68%; severen= 9, 32%). The sample was physically active according to their responses to the Incidental and Planned Exercise Questionnaire.\n\nParticipant demographic and clinical characteristics. Values aren(%) unless otherwise stated.\n\nAbbreviations: HV, hallux valgus; IPEQ, incidental and planned exercise questionnaire; TAFE, technical and further education.\n\nShort Form 12 Health Survey (SF‐12): scores ranged from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better function.\n\nManchester–Oxford Foot Questionnaire (MOXFQ): scores range from 0 to 4 for each domain, with 4 indicating greater pain and for the MOXFQ‐Index scores, score ranges from 0 to 100, 100 indicating greater pain.\n\nVisual analogue scale (VAS): scores ranged from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating worse pain.\n\nForefoot width was greater than toe‐box width in 10 cases (36%) and narrower in 18 cases (64%). The mean (SD) forefoot width was 102.4 mm (6.0) and the mean (SD) toe‐box width was 99.8 mm (7.9). This difference was not statistically significant (mean difference [MD] = 2.6 mm, 95% CI = −1.1 to 6.4;p= 0.168). The forefoot area was smaller than the toe‐box area in 27 cases (96%) and greater in one case (4%). The mean (SD) forefoot area was 42,435 mm2(8861) and the mean (SD) toe‐box area was 56,260 mm2(13,825). This difference was statistically significant (MD = −13,825 mm2, 95% CI = −20,047 to −7603p< 0.001).\n\nPeak pressure and maximum force at the distal and proximal forefoot are shown in Table2. Peak pressure (MD = 33.0 kPa, 95% CI = 17.7 to 48.4;p< 0.001) and maximum force (MD = 12.8 N, 95% CI = 5.5 to 20.1;p= 0.001) were significantly greater at the distal compared to proximal forefoot. Peak pressure and maximum force at both the medial forefoot regions over stance phase are shown in Figures3and4, respectively. Time to peak pressure at the proximal and distal forefoot occurred at 73.7% (17.8) and 79.8% (10.2) of stance phase, respectively. This difference was not statistically significant (MD = 6.0%, 95% CI = −0.8 to 12.9;p= 0.083). Time to maximum force at the proximal and distal forefoot occurred at 73.3% (17.5) and 80.2% (10.1) of stance phase, respectively. This difference was statistically significant (MD = 6.9%, 95% CI = 0.15 to 13.7;p= 0.045).\n\nPeak pressure (kPa) and maximum force (N) at the distal and proximal forefoot and the correlation with forefoot width differential and area differential.\n\nWidth differential = difference between the width of the forefoot and the width of the toe box, with a greater/positive value indicating the forefoot is wider.\n\nArea differential = difference between the area of the forefoot and the area of the toe box, with a greater/positive values indicating the forefoot is larger.\n\n\n\nPeak pressure (kPa) at the medial forefoot over stance phase. The following intervals for subphases in stance phase were used: loading (0%–20% of stance), midstance (> 20% to 52%), terminal stance (> 52% to 83%) and pre‐swing (> 83% to 100%).\n\n\n\nMaximum force (N) at the medial forefoot over stance phase. The following intervals for subphases in the stance phase were used: loading (0%–20% of stance), midstance (> 20% to 52%), terminal stance (> 52% to 83%) and pre‐swing (> 83% to 100%).\n\nCorrelations between peak pressures during walking and measurements of toe‐box dimensions are shown in Table2. There was little to no relationship between distal forefoot peak pressure and forefoot width differential (ρ= −0.15,p= 0.443) and a fair nonstatistically significant relationship between proximal forefoot peak pressure and forefoot width differential (ρ= −0.27,p= 0.172). There was little to no relationship between distal forefoot peak pressure and forefoot area differential (ρ= 0.13,p= 0.503) and little to no relationship between proximal forefoot peak pressure and forefoot area differential (ρ= 0.16,p= 0.427).\n\nCorrelations between maximum force during walking and measurements of toe‐box dimensions are shown in Table2. There was little to no relationship between distal forefoot maximum force and forefoot width differential (ρ= −0.10,p= 0.634) or proximal forefoot maximum force and forefoot width differential (ρ= −0.08,p= 0.680). There was little to no relationship between distal forefoot maximum force and forefoot area differential (ρ= 0.23,p= 0.244) and a fair nonstatistically significant relationship between proximal forefoot maximum force and forefoot area differential (ρ= 0.35,p= 0.065).\n\nIn this study, we used a novel technique to measure in‐shoe medial forefoot pressures in women with HV, with the aim of determining whether the shape of the toe‐box influences these pressures during walking. We found that peak pressure and maximum force occurred slightly earlier during late stance phase at the proximal forefoot compared to the distal forefoot. However, we found only little to fair, nonstatistically significant relationships between toe‐box dimensions and medial forefoot pressures, suggesting that the two‐dimensional shape of the shoes (as measured using length and area differential) worn by our sample may not influence medial forefoot loading in HV. Interestingly, the shoe toe‐box area was significantly larger than the foot, so it is possible that the shoes worn were not overly constrictive in most of our participants.\n\nOur findings that significantly greater peak pressure and maximum force occurred at the distal forefoot compared to the proximal forefoot are in contrast to previous studies that reported greater peak pressure at the first metatarsophalangeal joint compared to the first interphalangeal joint [18,19]. This disparity may be due to differences in methods to obtain pressure data. Previous studies used discrete sensors to obtain pressure data, whereas we used a matrix device. The matrix device provides a large area for pressures to be detected, compared to discrete sensors that detect pressure at isolated regions and may move during testing.\n\nOur findings that the relationships between toe‐box shape and medial forefoot pressures were weak and not statistically significant were unexpected, given that narrow‐fitting footwear is considered an important risk factor for the development of HV [11]. In accordance with our findings, the only other study among people with HV found no significant difference in pressures at the medial forefoot between participants own footwear and footwear with a round accommodative toe box [17]. Notably, this study and our own included people with moderate or severe HV (none had no or mild HV), who may self‐select footwear that does not increase pressure on their HV deformity. Indeed, because our sample had symptoms for some time, many had already changed their footwear to make it more comfortable. We also did not control for the compliance of the materials used for the upper of participants' footwear and noted that in some participants, the upper of the shoe was already stretched as a result of their HV. Indeed, a relationship between pressure and upper material flexibility has previously been suggested [33].\n\nThe clinical implication of our study is that changing the toe‐box width and area of the usual footwear worn by older women with painful, moderate or severe HV may not necessarily reduce medial forefoot pressures, particularly if the footwear has been worn for a long period of time. As such, footwear selection for this group needs to consider all facets of footwear, including duration of wear and upper materials, and not width or area alone. Furthermore, our findings suggest that generic footwear advice should not be the only management provided for HV, but be part of an individualised, multimodal approach including orthotic devices and muscle strengthening/retraining exercises [34].\n\nOur study has several strengths. First, this is the first study to investigate medial forefoot pressures among people with HV using a matrix style device. This reduced the risk of measurement error due to sensor migration and placement error that can occur with discrete sensors [35]. Second, participants were representative of people who most frequently present with HV based on age and sex [2]. Third, we normalised timing to stance phase duration, which has not been done in previous studies. Finally, we investigated medial forefoot pressures using participants' own footwear, which improves the external validity of our findings.\n\nAlthough this study has several strengths, the findings must be interpreted in the context of its limitations. First, the pedar pad is a novel approach to measuring in‐shoe pressures, but further investigation of the reliability and validity of this system is required. The pedar pad is bulkier than discrete sensors and was difficult to adhere to the foot in participants who wore very tight shoes. Peak pressures may have been underestimated due to the need to zero the device when the shoe is worn, and the pedar pad is only able to document perpendicular forces. Second, our participants were drawn from a pilot and feasibility trial. Consequently, our sample was relatively small, and our results may not be generalisable to the broader population of people with HV. As stated previously, our sample wore shoes that were not overly constrictive, which may explain why we only found weak relationships between toe‐box dimensions and medial forefoot pressures. Third, we did not consider the flexibility of the deformity, and it is possible that pressures may vary depending on the available range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal joints. Fourth, hand tracing of footwear dimensions may not have optimal accuracy compared to three‐dimensional foot scanning. Finally, as this is a cross‐sectional study, causal relationships cannot be inferred.\n\nFurther research is required to better understand the relationship between toe‐box dimensions and medial forefoot pressures in HV. Investigating other methods for measuring footwear characteristics such as thickness and the pliability of the upper may yield valuable insights. Future studies would benefit from larger sample sizes and a greater variety of age groups. Of particular interest would be younger women, as women with HV are more likely to report wearing footwear with a constrictive toe box between the ages of 20 and 39 years [11]. In addition, comparison of people with various stages of HV may provide insights into how HV severity modulates in‐shoe medial forefoot pressures. Furthermore, longitudinal studies may expand our understanding of the temporal relationship between footwear shape, medial forefoot pressures and HV development.\n\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrated that peak pressure and maximum force were greater and peaked slightly later during late stance phase at the distal forefoot compared to the proximal forefoot during level walking in women with moderate or severe painful HV. Notably, there were no statistically significant relationships between toe‐box shape and medial forefoot pressures during walking. These findings demonstrate that older women with painful HV may self‐select footwear with appropriate toe‐box fit and shape to accommodate their deformity, and therefore management recommendations for HV should include tailored multimodal approaches, beyond education to wear wider fitting footwear.\n\nKatrina J.
