A pooled analysis of the duration of chemoprophylaxis against malaria after treatment with artesunate-amodiaquine and artemether-lumefantrine  Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) are the most commonly-used treatments against Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Africa.
The lumefantrine and amodiaquine partner drugs may provide differing durations of post-treatment prophylaxis, an important additional benefit to patients.
Analyzing 4214 individuals from clinical trials in 12 sites, we estimated a mean duration of post-treatment protection of 13.0 days (95% CI 10.7-15.7) for AL and 15.2 days (95% CI 12.8-18.4) for AS-AQ after allowing for transmission intensity.
However, the duration varied substantially between sites: where wild type pfmdr1 86 and pfcrt 76 parasite genotypes predominated, AS-AQ provided [~]2-fold longer protection than AL.
Conversely, AL provided up to 1.5-fold longer protection than AS-AQ where mutants were common.
We estimate that choosing AL or AS-AQ as first-line treatment according to local drug sensitivity could alter population-level clinical incidence of malaria by up to 14% in under-five year olds where malaria transmission is high.
Comparative functional survival and equivalent annual cost of three long lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) products in Tanzania  Almost 1.2 billion long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) have been procured for malaria control.
Institutional buyers often assume that World Health Organization (WHO) prequalified LLINs are functionally identical with a three-year lifespan.
We measured the lifespans of three LLIN products, and calculated their cost-per-year of functional life, through a randomised double-blinded prospective evaluation among 3,420 study households in Tanzania using WHO-recommended methods.
Primary outcome was LLIN functional survival (LLINs present in serviceable condition).
Secondary outcomes were 1) bioefficacy and chemical content (residual insecticidal activity) and 2) protective efficacy for volunteers sleeping under LLINs (bite reduction and mosquitoes killed).
LLIN median functional survival was significantly different: 2{middle dot}0 years for Olyset, 2{middle dot}5 years for PermaNet and 2{middle dot}6 years for NetProtect.
Functional survival was affected by accumulation of holes resulting in users discarding nets.
Protective efficacy also significantly differed between products as they aged.
The longer-lived nets were 20% cheaper than the shorter-lived product.
Hidden heterogeneity and its influence on dengue vaccination impact  The CYD-TDV vaccine was recently developed to combat dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease that afflicts millions of people each year throughout the tropical and subtropical world.
Its rollout has been complicated by recent findings that vaccinees with no prior exposure to dengue virus (DENV) experience an elevated risk of severe disease in response to their first DENV infection subsequent to vaccination.
As a result of these findings, guidelines for use of CYD-TDV now require serological screening prior to vaccination to establish that an individual does not fall into this high-risk category.
These complications mean that the public health impact of CYD-TDV vaccination is expected to be higher in areas with higher transmission.
One important practical difficulty with tailoring vaccination policy to local transmission contexts is that DENV transmission is spatially heterogeneous, even at the scale of neighborhoods or blocks within a city.
This raises the question of whether models based on data that average over spatial heterogeneity in transmission could fail to capture important aspects of CYD-TDV impact in spatially heterogeneous populations.
We explored this question with a deterministic model of DENV transmission and CYD-TDV vaccination in a population comprised of two communities with differing transmission intensities.
Compared to the full model, a version of the model based on the average of the two communities failed to capture benefits of targeting the intervention to the high-transmission community, which resulted in greater impact in both communities than we observed under even coverage.
In addition, the model based on the average of the two communities substantially overestimated impact among vaccinated individuals in the low-transmission community.
In the event that the specificity of serological screening is not high, this result suggests that models that ignore spatial heterogeneity could overlook the potential for harm to this segment of the population.
Optimizing the deployment of ultra-low volume and indoor residual spraying for dengue outbreak response  Recent years have seen rising incidence of dengue and large outbreaks of Zika and chikungunya, which are all caused by viruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.
In most settings, the primary intervention against Aedes-transmitted viruses is vector control, such as indoor, ultra-low volume (ULV) spraying.
Targeted indoor residual spraying (TIRS) has the potential to more effectively impact Aedes-borne diseases, but its implementation requires careful planning and evaluation.
The optimal time to deploy these interventions and their relative epidemiological effects are not well understood, however.
We used an agent-based model of dengue virus transmission calibrated to data from Iquitos, Peru to assess the epidemiological effects of these interventions under differing strategies for deploying them.
Specifically, we compared strategies where spray application was initiated when incidence rose above a threshold based on incidence in recent years to strategies where spraying occurred at the same time(s) each year.
In the absence of spraying, the model predicted 361,000 infections [inter-quartile range (IQR): 347,000 - 383,000] in the period 2000-2010.
The ULV strategy with the fewest median infections was spraying twice yearly, in March and October, which led to a median of 172,000 infections [IQR: 158,000 - 183,000] over the 11-year study period, a 52% reduction from baseline.
Compared to spraying once yearly in September, the best threshold-based strategy utilizing ULV had fewer median infections (254,000 vs. 261,000), but required more spraying (351 vs. 274 days).
Compared to spraying once yearly in September, the best threshold-based strategy utilizing ULV had fewer median infections (254,000 vs. 261,000), but required more spraying (351 vs. 274 days).
Compared to spraying once yearly in September, the best threshold-based strategy utilizing ULV had fewer median infections (254,000 vs. 261,000), but required more spraying (351 vs. 274 days).
For TIRS, the best strategy was threshold-based, which led to the fewest infections of all strategies tested (9,900; [IQR: 8,720 - 11,400], a 94% reduction), and required fewer days spraying than the equivalent ULV strategy (280).
Although spraying twice each year is likely to avert the most infections, our results indicate that a threshold-based strategy can become an alternative to better balance the translation of spraying effort into impact, particularly if used with a residual insecticide.
Author SummaryOver half of the worlds population is at risk of infection by dengue virus (DENV) from Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.
While most infected people experience mild or asymptomatic infections, dengue can cause severe symptoms, such as hemorrhage, shock, and death.
A vaccine against dengue exists, but it can increase the risk of severe disease in people who have not been previously infected by one of the four DENV serotypes.
Our study used a simulation model to explore alternative strategies for deploying insecticide in the city of Iquitos in the Peruvian Amazon.
Our simulations closely matched empirical patterns from studies of dengues ecology and epidemiology in Iquitos, such as mosquito population dynamics, human household structure, demography, human and mosquito movement, and virus transmission.
Our results indicate that an insecticide that has a long-lasting, residual effect will have the biggest impact on reducing DENV transmission.
For non-residual insecticides, we find that it is best to begin spraying close to the start of the dengue transmission season, as mosquito populations can rebound quickly and resume previous levels of transmission.
Dengue importation into Europe: a network connectivity-based approach  The spread of dengue through global human mobility is a major public health concern.
A key challenge is understanding the transmission pathways and mediating factors that characterized the patterns of dengue importation into non-endemic areas.
Utilizing a network connectivity-based approach, we analyze the importation patterns of dengue fever into European countries.
Seven connectivity indices were developed to characterize the role of the air passenger traffic, seasonality, incidence rate, geographical proximity, epidemic vulnerability, and wealth of a source country, in facilitating the transport and importation of dengue fever.
We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to examine the relationship between dengue importation and the connectivity indices while accounting for the air transport network structure.
We also incorporated network autocorrelation within a GLMM framework to investigate the propensity of a European country to receive an imported case, by virtue of its position within the air transport network.
The connectivity indices and dynamical processes of the air transport network were strong predictors of dengue importation in Europe.
With more than 70% of the variation in dengue importation patterns explained.
We found that transportation potential was higher for source countries with seasonal dengue activity, high passenger traffic, high incidence rates, lower economic status, and geographical proximity to a destination country in Europe.
Our findings provide evidence that the importation patterns of dengue into Europe can be largely explained by appropriately characterizing the heterogeneities of the source, and topology of the air transport network.
This contributes to the foundational framework for building integrated predictive models for bio-surveillance of dengue importation.
Simulation models of dengue transmission in Funchal, Madeira Island: influence of seasonality  The recent emergence and established presence of Aedes aegypti in the Autonomous Region of Madeira, Portugal, was responsible for the first autochthonous outbreak of dengue in Europe.
The island has not reported any dengue cases since the outbreak in 2012.
However, there is a high risk that an introduction of the virus would result in another autochthonous outbreak given the presence of the vector and permissive environmental conditions.
Understanding the dynamics of a potential epidemic is critical for targeted local control strategies.
Here, we adopt a deterministic model for the transmission of dengue in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.
The model integrates empirical and mechanistic parameters for virus transmission, under seasonally varying temperatures for Funchal, Madeira Island.
We examine the epidemic dynamics as triggered by the arrival date of an infectious individual; the influence of seasonal temperature mean and variation on the epidemic dynamics; and performed a sensitivity analysis on the following quantities of interest: the epidemic peak size, time to peak and the final epidemic size.
Our results demonstrate the potential for summer to early winter transmission of dengue, with the arrival date significantly affecting the distribution of the timing and peak size of the epidemic.
Mid-summer to early autumn arrivals are more likely to produce larger epidemics within a short peak time.
Epidemics within this favorable period had an average of 18% of the susceptible population infected at the peak, at an average peak time of 70 days.
We also demonstrated that seasonal temperature variation dramatically affects the epidemic dynamics, with warmer starting temperatures producing peaks more quickly after an introduction and larger epidemics.
Our model could serve as a useful guide in the development of effective local control and mitigation strategies for dengue fever in Madeira Island.
Author SummaryThe presence of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in Madeira Island had recently caused the first local outbreak of dengue in Europe.
The island is at risk of another local transmission if triggered by the introduction of the dengue virus by an infected person.
Using a mathematical model for the transmission of dengue, we examine the dynamics of a potential epidemic triggered by the arrival of an infected person on the island.
We also examine the impact of seasonal temperature variation on the epidemic dynamics.
Our results show the potential for summer to early winter transmission of dengue on the island, and that the arrival date of an infectious person affects the distribution of the timing and peak size of the epidemic.
Arrival dates during mid-summer to early autumn were more likely to produce larger epidemic peak size within a short time.
We also show that seasonal temperature variation dramatically affects the epidemic dynamics.
With warmer starting temperatures, epidemics peak more rapidly and produce a larger epidemic size.
Our model could be useful to estimate the risk of an epidemic outbreak and as a guide for local control and mitigation strategies for dengue on the island.
Co-circulation and misdiagnosis led to underestimation of the 2015-2017 Zika epidemic in the Americas  During the 2015-2017 Zika epidemic, dengue and chikungunya - two other viral diseases with the same vector as Zika - were also in circulation.
Under these circumstances, it is possible that numerous cases of Zika could have been misdiagnosed as dengue or chikungunya, or vice versa.
Applying this method to weekly incidence data from 43 countries throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, we estimated that 1,062,821 (95% CrI: 1,014,428-1,104,794) Zika cases occurred during this epidemic, which is 56.4% (95% CrI: 49.3-62.6%) more than the 679,743 cases diagnosed as Zika.
Our results imply that misdiagnosis was more common in countries with proportionally higher incidence of dengue and chikungunya, such as Brazil.
Longitudinal characterization of Plasmodium inter-species interactions during a period of 1 increasing prevalence of Plasmodium ovale  BackgroundThe epidemiology and severity of non-falciparum malaria in endemic settings has garnered limited attention.
We aimed to characterize the prevalence, interaction, clinical risk factors and temporal trends of non-falciparum malaria in endemic settings of Kenya.
MethodsWe diagnosed and analyzed infecting malaria species via PCR in 2027 clinical samples collected between 2008 and 2016.
Descriptive statistics were used to describe the prevalence and distribution of Plasmodium species.
A statistical model was designed and used for estimating the frequency of Plasmodium species and assessing inter-species interactions.
Mixed effect linear regression models with random intercepts for each location was used to test for change in prevalence over time.
Findings72*5% of the samples were P. falciparum single species infections, 25{middle dot}8% were mixed infections and only 1*7% occurred as single non-falciparum species infections.
23*1% were mixed infections containing P. ovale.
A likelihood-based model calculation of the population frequency of each species estimated a significant within-host interference between P. falciparum and P. ovale curtisi.

InterpretationFindings show higher prevalence of non-falciparum malaria than expected.
The proportion of infections that were positive for infection by P. ovale wallikeri and P. ovale curtisi was observed to significantly increase over the period of study which could be due to attenuated responsiveness to malaria drug treatment on these species.

The potential cost-effectiveness of controlling dengue in Indonesia using wMel Wolbachia released at scale: a modelling study  BackgroundRelease of virus-blocking Wolbachia infected mosquitoes is an emerging disease control strategy that aims to control dengue and other arboviral infections.
Early entomological data and modelling analyses have suggested promising outcomes and wMel Wolbachia releases are now ongoing or planned in 12 countries.
MethodsUsing costing data from existing Wolbachia releases, previous estimates of Wolbachia effectiveness, and a spatially-explicit model of release and surveillance requirements, we predicted the costs and effectiveness of the on-going programme in Yogyakarta City and three new hypothetical programmes in Yogyakarta Special Autonomous Region, Jakarta and Bali.
ResultsWe predicted Wolbachia to be a highly cost-effective intervention when deployed in high density urban areas with gross cost-effectiveness ratios below $1,500 per DALY averted.
When offsets from the health system and societal perspective were included, such programmes even became cost saving over 10-year time horizons with favourable benefit-cost ratios of 1.35 to 3.40.
Sequencing Wolbachia releases over ten years could reduce programme costs by approximately 38% compared to simultaneous releases everywhere, but also delays the benefits.
ConclusionsWolbachia releases in high density urban areas is expected to be highly cost-effective and could potentially be the first cost saving intervention for dengue.
PERFORMANCE OF GOOGLE TRENDS FOR EARLY DETECTION OF DENGUE INFECTION EPIDEMICS IN JAKARTA AND YOGYAKARTA  BackgroundEarly detection of disease outbreak is among the most critical role of the sub-national authorities as mandated by the health decentralization policy.
Several studies, including in Indonesia, have assessed the roles of Google Trends (GT) to improve dengue surveillance systems.
However, they were mostly located in specific areas or national level only.
No reports are available to compare the performance of GT for early detection of dengue outbreak among high burdened provinces.
AimsThis study aimed to examine the correlation between GT data on dengue-related query terms with the official dengue surveillance reports in Jakarta and Yogyakarta Province.
MethodsRelative Search Volume of GT data for dengue were collected from the area of Jakarta and Yogyakarta between 2012 to 2016.
Those data were compared with the official dengue reports from the Indonesian Ministry of Health using Pearsons correlation and Time-lag correlation, performed with Stata version 13.
ResultsGT data are positively correlated with the routine surveillance report in Jakarta (r = 0.723, p-value= 0.000) and Yogyakarta Province (r = 0.715, p-value= 0.000).
In Jakarta, search term of  DBD demonstrated a very strong correlation for lag-1 (r =0.828, p-value= 0.000).
This finding indicates that GT data could possibly detect the dengue outbreak a month earlier, especially in Jakarta.
Hence, GT data can be used to monitor disease dynamics and improve the public awareness of a potential outbreak in near-real-time.
ConclusionGT data were positively correlated with the routine surveillance report in Jakarta and Yogyakarta Province.
Early warning system utilizing GT data is potentially more accurate in Jakarta than in Yogyakarta.
We assume that it is related with the larger population as well as the Internet use activities that drives the higher volume of Google search on dengue in Jakarta compared to Yogyakarta.
Correcting under-reported COVID-19 case numbers  The COVID-19 virus has spread worldwide in a matter of a few months, while healthcare systems struggle to monitor and report current cases.
Since severe cases, which more likely lead to fatal outcomes, are detected at a higher rate than mild cases, the reported virus mortality is likely inflated in most countries.
Lockdowns and changes in human behavior modulate the underlying growth rate of the virus.
Under-sampling of infection cases may lead to the under-estimation of total cases, resulting in systematic mortality estimation biases.
In this manuscript, we identify a generalizable growth rate decay reflecting behavioral change.
We propose a method to correct the reported COVID-19 cases and death numbers by using a benchmark country (South Korea) with near-optimal testing coverage, with considerations on population demographics.
We extrapolate expected deaths and hospitalizations with respect to observations in countries that passed the exponential growth curve.
By applying our correction, we predict that the number of cases is highly under-reported in most countries and a significant burden on worldwide hospital capacity.

COVID-19 clinical characteristics, and sex-specific risk of mortality: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis  ObjectivesThe rapidly evolving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020.
It was first detected in the city of Wuhan in China and has spread globally resulting in substantial health and economic crisis in many countries.
Observational studies have partially identified the different aspects of this disease.
MethodsWe reviewed the scientific literature published from January 1, 2019 to March 3, 2020.
Statistical analyses were performed with STATA (version 14, IC; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).
The pooled frequency with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was assessed using random effect model.
Publication bias was assessed and p <0.05 was considered a statistically significant publication bias.
ResultsOut of 1102 studies, 32 satisfied the inclusion criteria.
A total of 4789 patients with a mean age of 49 years were evaluated.
Fever (83.0%, CI 77.5 to 87.6), cough (65.2%, CI 58.6 to 71.2) and myalgia/fatigue (34.7, CI 26.0 to 44.4) were the most common symptoms.
The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (18.5 %, CI 12.7 to 24.4) and Cardiovascular disease (14.9 %, CI 6.0 to 23.8).
Among the laboratory abnormalities, elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (72.0% (CI 54.3 to 84.6) and lymphopenia (50.1%, CI 38.0 to 62.4) were the most common findings.
Bilateral ground-glass opacities (66.0%, CI 51.1 to 78.0) was the most common CT-Scan presentation.
Pooled mortality rate was 6.6%, with males having significantly higher mortality compared to females (OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 9.1, P = 0.01).
ConclusionCOVID-19 commonly presented with a progressive course of cough and fever with more than half of hospitalized patients showing leukopenia or a high CRP on their laboratory findings.
Mortality associated with COVID19 was higher than that reported in studies in China with Males having a 3-fold higher risk of mortality in COVID19 compared to females.

Pyrethroid resistance in Anopheles gambiae not associated with insecticide-treated mosquito net effectiveness across sub-Saharan Africa.
BackgroundPyrethroid resistance is a major concern for malaria vector control programs that predominantly rely on insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITN).
Contradictory results of the impact of resistance have been observed in field studies.
MethodsWe combined continent-wide estimates of pyrethroid resistance in Anopheles gambiae from 2006-2017 with continent-wide survey data to assess the effect of increasing pyrethroid resistance on the effectiveness of ITNs to prevent malaria infections in sub-Saharan Africa.
We utilized both a pooled-data approach and meta-regression of survey regions to assess how pyrethroid resistance affects the association between ITN ownership and malaria outcomes in children aged 6-59 months.
FindingsITN ownership reduced the risk of malaria outcomes in both pooled and meta-regression approaches.
In the pooled analysis, there was no observed interaction between ITN ownership and estimated level of pyrethroid resistance (Likelihood ratio [LR] test = 1.127 for the outcome of rapid diagnostic test confirmed malaria infection, p = 0.2885; LR test = 0.161 for the outcome of microscopy confirmed malaria infection, p = 0.161; LR test = 0.646 for the outcome of moderate or severe anemia, p = 0.4215).
In the meta-regression approach the level of pyrethroid resistance did not explain any of the variance in subnational estimates of ITN effectiveness for any of the outcomes.
InterpretationITNs decreased risk of malaria outcomes independent of the levels of pyrethroid resistance in the malaria vector populations.
FundingDAL did not receive funding and RC received a SOURCE grant from Syracuse University for this project.
Mapping insecticide resistance in mosquitoes to aid malaria control  Malaria vector control may be compromised by resistance to insecticides in vector populations.
Using a published geostatistical ensemble model, we have generated maps that bridge these gaps and consider the likelihood that resistance exceeds recommended thresholds.
Our results show that this model provides more accurate next-year predictions than two simpler approaches.
We have used the model to generate district-level maps for the probability that pyrethroid resistance in Anopheles gambiae s.l.
exceeds the World Health Organization (WHO) thresholds for susceptibility and confirmed resistance.
In addition, we have mapped the three criteria for the deployment of piperonyl butoxide-treated nets that mitigate against the effects of metabolic resistance to pyrethroids.
This includes a critical review of the evidence for presence of cytochrome P450-mediated metabolic resistance mechanisms across Africa.
The maps for pyrethroid resistance are available on the IR Mapper website where they can be viewed alongside the latest survey data.
Significance StatementMalaria control in Africa largely relies on the use of insecticides to prevent mosquitoes from transmitting the malaria parasite to humans, however, these mosquitoes have evolved resistance to these insecticides.
To manage this threat to malaria control, it is vital that we map locations where the prevalence of resistance exceeds thresholds defined by insecticide resistance management plans.
A geospatial model and data from Africa are used to predict locations where thresholds of resistance linked to specific recommended actions are exceeded.
This model is shown to provide more accurate next-year predictions than two simpler approaches.
Evaluation of nine commercial SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays  Due to urgency and demand, numerous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoassays are rapidly being developed and placed on the market with limited validation on clinical samples.
Thorough validation of serological tests are required to facilitate their use in the accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmation of molecular results, contact tracing, and epidemiological studies.
These included three enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and six point-of-care (POC) lateral flow tests.
The assays were validated using serum samples from: i) SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients with a documented first day of disease; ii) archived sera obtained from healthy individuals before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China; iii) sera from patients with acute viral respiratory tract infections caused by other coronaviruses or non-coronaviruses; and iv) sera from patients positive for dengue virus, cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr virus.
The results showed 100% specificity for the Wantai SARS-CoV-2 Total Antibody ELISA, 93% for the Euroimmun IgA ELISA, and 96% for the Euroimmun IgG ELISA with sensitivities of 90%, 90%, and 65%, respectively.
The overall performance of the POC tests according to manufacturer were in the rank order of AutoBio Diagnostics > Dynamiker Biotechnology = CTK Biotech > Artron Laboratories > Acro Biotech [&ge;] Hangzhou Alltest Biotech.
Overall, these findings will facilitate selection of serological assays for the detection SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies towards diagnosis as well as sero-epidemiological and vaccine development studies.
How much India detecting SARS-CoV-2 Infections?
A model-based estimation  Background and RationaleAmid SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the low number of infections for a population size of 1.38 billion is widely discussed, but with no definite answers.
MethodsWe used the model proposed by Bommer and Vollmer to assess the quality of official case records.
The infection fatality rates were taken from Verity et al (2020).
Reported number of deaths and SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases from https://www.covid19india.org.
The reported numbers of samples tests were collected from the reports of the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR).
ResultsThe findings suggest that India is detecting just 3.6% of the total number of infections with a huge variation across its states.
Among 13 states which have more than 100 COVID-19 cases, the detection rate varies from 81.9% (of 410 estimated infections) in Kerala to 0.8% (of 35487 estimated infections) in Madhya Pradesh and 2.4% (of 7431 estimated infections) in Gujarat.
ConclusionAs the study reports a lower number of deaths and higher recovery rates in the states with a high detection rate, thus suggest that India must enhance its testing capacity and go for widespread testing.
Late detection puts patients in greater need of mechanical ventilation and ICU care, which imposes greater costs on the health system.
The country should also adopt population-level random testing to assess the prevalence of the infection.

Outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 in China and the United States  On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019, COVID19, a global pandemic.
In an unprecedented collective effort, massive amounts of data are now being collected worldwide to estimate the immediate and long-term impact of this pandemic on the health system and the global economy.
Here we integrate a global network model with a local epidemic SEIR model to quantify the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 in China and the United States.
For the outbreak in China, in n = 30 provinces, we found a latent period of 2.56{+/-}0.72 days, a contact period of 1.47{+/-}0.32 days, and an infectious period of 17.82{+/-}2.95 days.
For the early stages of the outbreak in the United States, in n = 50 states, we adopted the disease-specific values from China, and found a contact period of 3.38{+/-}0.69 days.
Our network model predicts that-without the massive political mitigation strategies that are in place today-the United states would have faced a basic reproduction number of 5.3{+/-}0.95 and a nationwide peak of the outbreak on May 10, 2020 with 3 million infections.
Our results demonstrate how mathematical modeling can help estimate outbreak dynamics and provide decision guidelines for successful outbreak control.
We anticipate that our model will become a valuable tool to estimate the potential of vaccination and quantify the effect of relaxing political measures including total lock down, shelter in place, and travel restrictions for low-risk subgroups of the population or for the population as a whole.
Learning as We Go: An Examination of the Statistical Accuracy of COVID19 Daily Death Count Predictions  A recent model developed at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) provides forecasts for ventilator use and hospital beds required for the care of COVID19 patients on a state-by-state basis throughout the United States over the period March 2020 through August 2020 (See the related website https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections for interactive data visualizations).
In this paper, we evaluate the predictive validity of model forecasts for COVID19 outcomes as data become sequentially available, using the IHME prediction of daily deaths.
We have found that the predictions for daily number of deaths provided by the IHME model have been highly inaccurate.
The model has been found to perform poorly even when attempting to predict the number of next day deaths.
In particular, the true number of next day deaths has been outside the IHME prediction intervals as much as 70% of the time.
Neutralising antibodies to SARS coronavirus 2 in Scottish blood donors - a pilot study of the value of serology to determine population exposure  BackgroundThe progression and geographical distribution of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the UK and elsewhere is unknown because typically only symptomatic individuals are diagnosed.
We performed a serological study of blood donors in Scotland between the 17th of March and the 18th of May to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 as a marker of past infection and epidemic progression.
AimTo determine if sera from blood bank donors can be used to track the emergence and progression of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
MethodsA pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay was used to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
The study group comprised samples from 3,500 blood donors collected in Scotland between the 17th of March and 19th of May, 2020.
Controls were collected from 100 donors in Scotland during 2019.
ResultsAll samples collected on the 17th March, 2020 (n=500) were negative in the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay.
Neutralising antibodies were detected in 6/500 donors from the 23th-26th of March.
The number of samples containing neutralising antibodies did not significantly rise after the 5th-6th April until the end of the study on the 18th of May.
We find that infections are concentrated in certain postcodes indicating that outbreaks of infection are extremely localised.
In contrast, other areas remain comparatively untouched by the epidemic.
ConclusionThese data indicate that sero-surveys of blood banks can serve as a useful tool for tracking the emergence and progression of an epidemic like the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
State-level variation of initial COVID-19 dynamics in the United States: The role of local government interventions  During an epidemic, metrics such as R0, doubling time, and case fatality rates are important in understanding and predicting the course of an epidemic.
We examine how commonly used epidemiological metrics differ for each individual state within the United States during the initial COVID-19 outbreak.
In particular, restricting restaurant operations was correlated with increased doubling times.

Quantitative form and fit of N95 filtering facepiece respirators are retained and coronavirus surrogate is inactivated after heat treatments  Re-use of filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs, commonly referred to as N95s) normally meant for single use only is becoming common in healthcare facilities due to shortages caused by the COVID19 pandemic.
Here we report that mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) initially seeded on FFR filter material is inactivated (6 log reduction as measured by 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)) after dry heating at 75 {o}C for 30 minutes.
We also find that the quantitative fit of FFRs after heat treatment at this temperature, under dry conditions or at 90% relative humidity, is not affected by single or ten heating cycles.
Previous studies have reported that the filtration efficiency of FFR filters is not negatively impacted by these heating conditions.
These results suggest that thermal inactivation of coronaviruses is a potentially rapid and widely deployable method to re-use N95 FFRs in emergency situations where re-using FFRs is a necessity and broad-spectrum sterilization is unavailable.
However, we also found that a heat source that emits radiation (e.g., an exposed heating element) results in rapid qualitative degradation of the FFR.
Finally, we discuss differences in the results reported here and other recent studies investing heat as a means to recycle FFRs and suggest that overall wear time and donning/doffing cycles are important factors that need to be considered.

Diagnosis and Prediction Model for COVID19 Patients Response to Treatment based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Whale Optimization Algorithm Using CT Images  The outbreak of coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) has rabidly spread all over the world.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that coronavirus COVID-19 is an international pandemic.
The Real-Time Reverse transcription-polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) has a low positive and sensitivity rate in the early stage of COVID-19.
As a result, the Computed Tomography (CT) imaging is used for diagnosing.
COVID-19 has different key signs on a CT scan differ from other viral pneumonia.
These signs include ground-glass opacities, consolidations, and crazy paving.
In this paper, an Artificial Intelli-gence-inspired Model for COVID-19 Diagnosis and Prediction for Patient Response to Treatment (AIMDP) is proposed.
AIMDP model has two main functions reflected in two proposed modules, namely, the Diagnosis Module (DM) and Prediction Module (PM).
The Diagnosis Module (DM) is proposed for early and accurately detecting the patients with COVID-19 and distinguish it from other viral pneumonias using COVID-19 signs obtained from CT scans.
The DM model, uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as a Deep learning technique for segmentation, can process hundreds of CT images in seconds to speed up diagnosis of COVID-19 and contribute in its containment.
In this context, the Prediction Module (PM) is proposed for predicting the ability of the patient to respond to treatment based on different factors e.g.
age, infection stage, respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and the treatment regimens.
PM implement the Whale Optimization Algorithm for selecting the most relevant patients features.
The experimental results show promising performance for the proposed diagnosing and prediction modules, using a dataset with hundreds of real data and CT images.
Predicting the impact of asymptomatic transmission,non-pharmaceutical intervention and testing on the spread of COVID19COVID19  We introduce a novel mathematical model to analyze the effect of removing non-pharmaceutical interventions on the spread of COVID19 as a function of disease testing rate.
We find that relaxing interventions has a strong impact on the size of the epidemic peak as a function of intervention removal time.
We show that it is essential for predictive models to explicitly capture transmission from asymptomatic carriers and important to obtain precise information on asymptomatic transmission by testing.
The asymptomatic reservoir, reported to account for as much as 85% of transmission, will contribute to resurgence of the epidemic if public health interventions are removed too soon.
Use of more basic models that fail to capture asymptomatic transmission can result in large errors in predicted clinical caseload or in fitted epidemiological parameters and, therefore, may be unreliable in estimating the risk of a second wave based on the timing of terminated interventions.
An Interactive Tool to Forecast US Hospital Needs in the Coronavirus 2019 Pandemic  Hospital enterprises have been continually faced with anticipating the spread of COVID- 19 and the effects it is having on visits, admissions, bed needs, and crucial supplies.
We developed a web-based application (available at: http://covid19forecast.rush.edu/) for US states and territories that allows users to choose from a suite of models already employed in characterizing the spread of COVID-19.
Users can obtain forecasts for hospital visits and admissions as well as anticipated needs for ICU and non-ICU beds, ventilators, and personal protective equipment supplies.
Our application is primarily designed for hospital leaders, healthcare workers, and government official who may lack specialized knowledge in epidemiology and modeling.
As the dynamics of COVID-19 change, our application will also change to meet emerging needs of the healthcare community.
Spatio-temporal associations between deforestation and malaria incidence in Lao PDR  As countries in the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) increasingly focus their malaria control and elimination efforts on forest-going populations, greater understanding of the relationship between deforestation and malaria incidence will be essential for programs to assess and meet their 2030 elimination goals.
Leveraging village-level health facility surveillance data and forest cover data in a spatio-temporal modeling framework, we found evidence that deforestation is associated with short-term increases, but long-term decreases in confirmed malaria case incidence in Lao Peoples Democratic Republic (Lao PDR).
We identified strong associations with deforestation measured within 30 km of villages but not with deforestation in the near (10 km) and immediate (1 km) vicinity.
Results appear driven by deforestation in densely forested areas and were more pronounced for infections with Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) than for Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax).
Results appear driven by deforestation in densely forested areas and were more pronounced for infections with Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) than for Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax).
These findings highlight the influence of forest-going populations on malaria transmission in the GMS.
Deep phenotyping of 34,128 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 and a comparison with 81,596 influenza patients in America, Europe and Asia: an international network study  BackgroundIn this study we phenotyped individuals hospitalised with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in depth, summarising entire medical histories, including medications, as captured in routinely collected data drawn from databases across three continents.
We then compared individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 to those previously hospitalised with influenza.
MethodsWe report demographics, previously recorded conditions and medication use of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the US (Columbia University Irving Medical Center [CUIMC], Premier Healthcare Database [PHD], UCHealth System Health Data Compass Database [UC HDC], and the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA OMOP]), in South Korea (Health Insurance Review & Assessment [HIRA]), and Spain (The Information System for Research in Primary Care [SIDIAP] and HM Hospitales [HM]).
These patients were then compared with patients hospitalised with influenza in 2014-19.
Results34,128 (US: 8,362, South Korea: 7,341, Spain: 18,425) individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 were included.
Between 4,811 (HM) and 11,643 (CUIMC) unique aggregate characteristics were extracted per patient, with all summarised in an accompanying interactive website (http://evidence.ohdsi.org/Covid19CharacterizationHospitalization/).
Patients were majority male in the US (CUIMC: 52%, PHD: 52%, UC HDC: 54%, VA OMOP: 94%,) and Spain (SIDIAP: 54%, HM: 60%), but were predominantly female in South Korea (HIRA: 60%).
Age profiles varied across data sources.
Prevalence of asthma ranged from 4% to 15%, diabetes from 13% to 43%, and hypertensive disorder from 24% to 70% across data sources.
Between 14% and 33% were taking drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system in the 30 days prior to hospitalisation.
Compared to 81,596 individuals hospitalised with influenza in 2014-19, patients admitted with COVID-19 were more typically male, younger, and healthier, with fewer comorbidities and lower medication use.
Protecting groups known to be vulnerable to influenza is a useful starting point to minimize the number of hospital admissions needed for COVID-19.

Concentration-dependent mortality of chloroquine in overdose  Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are used extensively in malaria and rheumatological conditions, and now in COVID-19 prevention and treatment.
Although generally safe they are potentially lethal in overdose.
In-vitro data suggest that high concentrations and thus high doses are needed for COVID-19 infections, but as yet there is no convincing evidence they are clinically effective.
Bayesian regression models were fitted to survival outcomes and electrocardiograph QRS durations from 302 prospectively studied French patients who had taken intentional chloroquine overdoses, of whom 33 died (11%), and 16 healthy volunteers who took 620 mg base chloroquine single doses.
Whole blood concentrations of 13.5 mol/L (95% credible interval 10.1-17.7) were associated with 1% mortality.
Prolongation of ventricular depolarisation is concentration-dependent with a QRS duration >150 msec independently highly predictive of mortality.
Pharmacokinetic modelling combined with these lethality data predicts that the majority of chloroquine regimens trialled in COVID-19 should not cause serious cardiovascular toxicity.
Searching the Sigmoid-type trend in Lock Down period covid19 data of India and its different states  We have worked on imported covid19 cases of India, detected after declaration of lock down.
They are marked as hidden travelers, who are detected later during 1-2 weeks period of lock down.
We have investigated the impact of those travelers on selective 15 states, having large number cases.
Among them 5 states have faced a noticeable effect on their data profile, although its overall effect in country level is quite negligible.
Searching the Sigmoid trends of all 15 states, we have identified 3 categories depending upon latest data of new case with respect to the peak value of Sigmoid functions.
Based on our optimistic predicted curves, ongoing lock down period might be enough for getting marginal values of new cases for KL, HR, JK, TN and AP but the reamining of 15 states might need a third phase of lock down or alternative preventive measures.
Performance Characteristics of the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG Assay and Seroprevalence Testing in Idaho  BackgroundCoronavirus disease-19 (COVID19), the novel respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with severe morbidity and mortality.
The rollout of diagnostic testing in the United States was slow, leading to numerous cases that were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 in February and March 2020, necessitating the use of serological testing to determine past infections.
MethodsWe evaluated the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by testing 3 distinct patient populations.
ResultsWe tested 1,020 serum specimens collected prior to SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the United States and found one false positive, indicating a specificity of 99.90%.
We tested 125 patients who tested RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 for which 689 excess serum specimens were available and found sensitivity reached 100% at day 17 after symptom onset and day 13 after PCR positivity.
Alternative index value thresholds for positivity resulted in 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in this cohort.
We tested 4,856 individuals from Boise, Idaho collected over one week in April 2020 as part of the Crush the Curve initiative and detected 87 positives for a positivity rate of 1.79%.
ConclusionsThese data demonstrate excellent analytical performance of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test as well as the limited circulation of the virus in the western United States.
We expect the availability of high-quality serological testing will be a key tool in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.
FACTORS INFLUENCING MENTAL HEALTH DURING COVID-19 OUTBREAK: AN EXPLORATORY SURVEY AMONG INDIAN POPULATION  PurposeResearch on the impact of social distancing on mental health during epidemics is limited, especially in India.
The purpose of this study is to scale the association between anxiety and socio-demographic factors during Covid19 lockdown among the general Indian population.
Design/methodology/approachA descriptive cross-sectional nationwide study was designed to enrol the general population.
The inclusion criteria for this study were Indian citizens aged 18 years and above.
The study was conducted from 29th March to 12th April 2020, using an online google questionnaire.
The anxiety among respondents was detected and measured using a Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale which consists of 7 questions (in English), i.e.
GAD-7.
FindingsRespondees were 392, and from these participants, the prevalence of anxiety was 25.3 per cent.
Based on the bivariate logistic regression analysis, the predictors of anxiety were gender, religion, occupation as business/self-employed, marital status, family size, health status and sleep deprivation.
ConclusionThis study reports the prevalence of anxiety among Indian population who were grounded at their homes during lockdown due to coronavirus pandemic in the country.
Originality/ValueThis paper fulfils an identified need to study the mental health status of the population under situations like lockdown, thereby helping fill a persistent gap in Indian research on this issue.
On the Generation of Medical Dialogues for COVID-19  Under the pandemic of COVID-19, people experiencing COVID19-related symptoms or exposed to risk factors have a pressing need to consult doctors.
Because of the shortage of medical professionals, many people cannot receive online consultations timely.
To address this problem, we aim to develop a medical dialogue system that can provide COVID19-related consultations.
We collected two dialogue datasets - CovidDialog - (in English and Chinese respectively) containing conversations between doctors and patients about COVID-19.
On these two datasets, we train several dialogue generation models based on Transformer, GPT, and BERT-GPT.
Specifically, we take the pretrained models of Transformer, GPT, and BERT-GPT on dialog datasets and other large-scale texts, then finetune them on our CovidDialog datasets.
Experiments demonstrate that these approaches are promising in generating meaningful medical dialogues about COVID-19.

COVID-19 in Uganda: Predicting the impact of the disease and public health response on disease burden  ObjectiveCOVID-19 transmission and the public health  lock-down response are now established in sub-Saharan Africa, including Uganda.
We predicted the relative impact of COVID-19 and the response in Uganda to understand whether the benefits could be outweighed by the costs.
Design and settingAge-based COVID-19 mortality data from China were applied to the population structures of Uganda and countries with previously established outbreaks, comparing theoretical mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost.
Based on recent Ugandan data and theoretical scenarios of programme deterioration, we predicted potential additional disease burden for HIV/AIDS, malaria and maternal mortality.
Main outcome measuresDALYs lost and mortality.
ResultsBased on population age structure alone Uganda is predicted to have a relatively low COVID-19 burden compared to equivalent transmission in China and Western countries, with mortality and DALYs lost predicted to be 12% and 19% that of Italy.
Scenarios of  lockdown impact predict HIV/AIDS and malaria equivalent to or higher than that of an extensive COVID-19 outbreak.
Emerging HIV/AIDS and maternal mortality data indicate that such deterioration could be occurring.
ConclusionsThe results predict a relatively low COVID-19 impact on Uganda associated with its young population, with a high risk of negative impact on non-COVID-19 disease burden from a prolonged lockdown response.
The results are likely to reflect the situation in other sub-Saharan populations, underlining the importance of tailoring COVID-19 responses to population structure and potential disease vulnerabilities.
Trends of SARS-CoV-2 infection worldwide: Role of population density, age structure, and climate on transmission and case fatality  IntroductionThe highly heterogenous disease transmission pattern of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic maybe driven by complex factors, which may include habitat suitability, region specific human mobility, and transmission related to susceptibility.
The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of different spatial and demographic factors on COVID-19 transmission and case fatality worldwide.
MethodsWe assessed SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission and COVID-19 related fatalities in 50 countries in all continents of the globe.
Data from the COVID-19 data repository of the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering, the European center for disease control and prevention, and the World Health Organization were used to obtain the daily number of cases and organize incidence data.
Disease spread was assessed using the reproduction number of the disease across the sampled countries.
R statistical softwares R0 package was used to estimate the reproduction number of the COVID19 using the exponential growth method.
After computing the reproductive number of each country in the study, a multiple linear regression model was fitted using R0 value as dependent variable, and latitude and population density as an independent variable.
Disease severity was analyzed using the case fatality ratio of COVID-19.
The proportion of deaths were meta-analyzed using the R statistical softwares metaphor package, using random effect inverse variance weighting to come up with the case fatality ratio.
ResultsWe found no statistically significant association between disease spread and latitude or population density.
The regression model analysis that accounted for age, population density and latitude showed that age distribution remains an important driver shaping the current distribution of COVID-19 cases.
The relative frequency of people above 65 years old was positively correlated with the cumulative numbers of COVID-19 cases as well as case fatality ratio in each country.
The multiple linear regression model fitted between CFR and the three major covariates showed that, the demographic distribution of the sampled countries is strongly associated with the case fatality ratio.
Correlation with proportion of populations over 65 years old is concordant with the previous findings relationship between case fatality ratio and patient age.
ConclusionThis analysis provides important information that can inform the decisions of local and global health authorities.
Particularly, as our study confirms that death and severity of COVID19 are associated with age, in countries with the biggest outbreaks, strategies must be employed to ensure that high-risk groups, such as old people received adequate protection from COVID-19.
Convalescent plasma therapy for the treatment of patients with COVID-19: Assessment of methods available for antibody detection and their correlation with neutralising antibody levels  IntroductionThe lack of approved specific therapeutic agents to treat COVID-19 associated with SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has led to the rapid implementation and/or randomised controlled trials of convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) in many countries including the UK.
Effective CPT is likely to require high titres of neutralising antibody levels in convalescent donations.
Understanding the relationship between functional neutralising antibodies and antibody levels to specific SARS-CoV-2 proteins in scalable assays will be crucial for the success of large-scale collection and use of convalescent plasma.
We assessed whether neutralising antibody titres correlated with reactivity in a range of ELISA assays targeting the spike (S) protein, the main target for human immune response.
MethodsBlood samples were collected from 52 individuals with a previous laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at least 28 days after symptom resolution.
These were assayed for SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies by native virus and lentiviral pseudotype assays, and for antibodies by four different ELISAs measuring antibody binding to different format of viral S proteins.
ROC analysis was used to further identify sensitivity and specificity of selected assays to identify samples containing high neutralising antibody levels suitable for clinical use of convalescent plasma.
ResultsAll samples contained SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, whereas neutralising antibody titres of greater than 1:20 were detected in 43 samples (83% of those tested) and >1:100 in 22 samples (42%).
The best correlations were observed with EUROimmun IgG ELISA S/CO reactivity (Spearman Rho correlation co-efficient 0.88; p<0.001).
Based on ROC analysis, EUROimmun would detect 60% of samples with titres of >1:100 with 100% specificity using a reactivity index of 9.1 (13/22).
DiscussionRobust associations between virus neutralising antibody titres and reactivity in several ELISA-based antibody tests demonstrate their possible utility for scaled-up production of convalescent plasma containing potentially therapeutic levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies.
Quantitative modeling and analysis show country-specific quarantine measures can circumvent COVID19 infection spread post lockdown  In response to the COVID19 outbreak many countries have implemented lockdown to ensure social distancing.
However, long lockdowns globally affected the livelihood of millions of people resulting in subsequent unlocks that started a second wave of infection in multiple countries.
Unlocking of the economies critically imposes extra burden on testing and quarantine of the infected people to keep the reproduction number (R0) <1.
We delineate a strategy to optimize the trade-off by utilizing a data-trained epidemic model and coupling it with a stochastic agent based model to implement contact tracing.
In a country specific manner, we quantitatively demonstrate how combination of unlock and testing can maintain R0 <1.

Case Study: Using Facebook Data to Monitor Adherence to Stay-at-home Orders in Colorado and Utah  In the absence of effective treatments, social distancing has been the only public health measure available to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the US, implementing this response has been left to state, county, and city officials, and many localities have issued some form of a stay-at-home order.
In response, several technology companies opened access to their users location data.
As part of the COVID-19 Data Mobility Network, we obtained access to Facebook User data and developed four key metrics and visualizations to monitor various aspects of adherence to stay at home orders.
These metrics were carefully incorporated into static and interactive visualizations for dissemination to local officials.

Estimating Force of Infection from Serologic Surveys with Imperfect Tests  The force of infection, or the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected, is an important public health measure for assessing the extent of outbreaks and the impact of control programs.
Here we present methods for estimating force of infection from serological surveys of infections which produce lasting immunity, taking into account imperfections in the test used, and uncertainty in such imperfections.
The methods cover both single serological surveys, in which age is a proxy for time at risk, and repeat surveys in the same people, in which the force of infection is estimated more directly.
Fixed values can be used for the sensitivity and specificity of the tests, or existing methods for belief elicitation can be used to include uncertainty in these values.
We illustrate the methods using data from two published serological studies of dengue.
Factors Associated with Mental Health Outcomes in Oman during COVID19: Frontline vs Non-frontline Healthcare Workers  OBJECTIVEThis study aims to assess and compare demographic and psychological factors and sleep status of frontline HCWs in relation to non-frontline HCWs  DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTSThis cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey from the 8th to the 17th of April 2020 across varied health care settings in Oman accruing 1139 HCWS.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESMental health status was assessed using Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21), and insomnia was evaluated by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI).
Chi-square, odds ratio, and independent t-tests were used to compare groups by demographic and mental health outcomes.
ResultsThis study included 1139 HCWs working in Oman.
There was a total of 368 (32.3%), 388 (34.1%), 271 (23.8%), and 211 (18.5%) respondents reported to have depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia, respectively while working during the pandemic period.
HCWs in the frontline group were 1.4 times more likely to have anxiety (OR=1.401, p=0.007) and stress (OR=1.404, p=0.015) as compared to those working in the non-frontline group.
On indices of sleep-wake cycles, HCWs in the frontline group were 1.37 times more likely to report insomnia (OR=1.377, p=0.037) when compared to those working in the non-frontline group.
No significant differences in depression status between workers in the frontline and non-frontline groups were found (p=0.181).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCETo our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the differential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on different grades of HCWs.
This study suggests that frontline HCWs are disproportionally affected compared to non-frontline HCWs.
The problem with managing sleep-wake cycles and anxiety symptoms were highly endorsed among frontline HCWs.
As psychosocial interventions are likely to be constrained owing to the pandemic, mental health care must first be directed to frontline HCWs.

Exploring Causal relationship between risk factors and vulnerability to COVID-19Cases of Italy, Spain, France, Greece, Portugal, Morocco and South Africa  Even though the infection rate of COVID-19 is very high as of today 31 May: 5,819,962 confirmed cases worldwide, the death rate is only about 6.23%, 362,786 deaths as for the same date.
Furthermore, the rate of total infected cases is extremely different from one country to another as well as for the rate of mortality.
In the literature, we have found multiple identified risk factors responsible for vulnerability to COVID19, we have chosen pertinent key risk factors for our study: Median-age, age>65 years old, weight, population density, diabetics, International arrivals, median temperature between March and May.
ObjectiveWe aim to find correlation between the identified risk factors and vulnerability to COVID-19 in seven different countries from Europe and Africa: Most affected countries Italy, Spain, France, moderately affected: Portugal, and less affected countries: Greece, Morocco and South Africa.
Data sourcesWHO, Worldometers, Ourworldindata  Populationall reported COVID-19 total in-hospital infected and death cases in Italy, Spain, France, Portugal, Greece, Morocco, and South Africa.
Time period15th March 2020 to 15th May 2020  MethodsWe used Multiple linear regression in our approach to modeling the relationship between the dependent variable (DV): vulnerability to COVID19 (which we presented by number of totals in-hospital infected cases per million for each country) and the independent variables (IV) scores: median age, aged 65+, population density, international arrivals, BMI, diabetes prevalence, and temperature.
We used SPSS software to generate multiple linear regression; Pearson correlation factor: r, ANOVA table, Coefficients table, as well as bar charts and scatter plots.
The multiple linear regression equation of our study model is: O_FD O_INLINEFIG[Formula 1]C_INLINEFIGM_FD(1)C_FD  Where:  Y: Predicted score on total cases per million or Vulnerability to COVID19; a: intercept; b1: regression coefficient or weight for median age; X1: median age; b2: regression coefficient or weight for population density; X2: population density; b3: regression coefficient or weight for international arrivals; X3: international arrivals in millions; b4: regression coefficient or weight average temperature; X4: average temperature in Celsius; b5: regression coefficient or weight for BMI; X5: BMI Body Mass Index in Kg/m; b6: regression coefficient or weight for diabetes prevalence percentage; X6: diabetes prevalence percentage; B7: regression coefficient or weight for aged 65+; X7: aged 65+ percentage  ResultsTill 15th May 2020 There were in Spain: 229540 total infected cases and 27321 total death attributed to COVID-19, France: 141356 total cases and 27425 total deaths, Italy: 223096 total cases and 31368 total deaths, Portugal: 28319 total cases and 1184 total deaths, Greece: 2770 total cases and 156 total deaths, Morocco: 6607 total cases and 190 total deaths, and South Africa: 12739 total cases and 238 total deaths.
In summary after full adjustment, total death cases were strongly associated with total infected cases for the population of all the seven chosen countries combined: correlation factor r= 0.921 with a P-value= .000: P<0.05 (Sig.(2-tailed).
Population density was significantly correlated with total infected cases for all the seven countries combined: r= 0.478 with a P-value= .000: P<0.05.
the median age was moderately associated with infected cases: r= 0.563 with P<0.05.
However, diabetes prevalence was less associated with infected cases: r= 0.146 with P<0.05.
International exposure was significantly associated with infected cases: r= 0.609 with P<0.05.
Median temperature was negatively correlated with total infected cases in the seven countries combined.
ConclusionsWe have quantified a range of risk factors for infection and death from COVID-19, in seven highly, moderate and less affected countries, in a large correlation-regression study.
Moreover, people from countries with high median age are at increased risk of in-hospital death from COVID19.
Furthermore, by conducting multiple linear regression analysis we have found that the overall regression model is significant (as shown in the tables).
66.2% (r2=.662) of the vulnerability is explained by the model which includes all predictor variables or risk factors.

Risk of depression, suicidal ideation, suicide and psychosis with hydroxychloroquine treatment for rheumatoid arthritis: a multi-national network cohort study  ObjectivesConcern has been raised in the rheumatological community regarding recent regulatory warnings that hydroxychloroquine used in the COVID-19 pandemic could cause acute psychiatric events.
We aimed to study whether there is risk of incident depression, suicidal ideation, or psychosis associated with hydroxychloroquine as used for rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
MethodsNew user cohort study using claims and electronic medical records from 10 sources and 3 countries (Germany, UK and US).
RA patients aged 18+ and initiating hydroxychloroquine were compared to those initiating sulfasalazine (active comparator) and followed up in the short (30-day) and long term (on treatment).
Propensity score stratification and calibration using negative control outcomes were used to address confounding.
Cox models were fitted to estimate database-specific calibrated hazard ratios (HR), with estimates pooled where I2<40%.
Results918,144 and 290,383 users of hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine, respectively, were included.
No consistent risk of psychiatric events was observed with short-term hydroxychloroquine (compared to sulfasalazine) use, with meta-analytic HRs of 0.96 [0.79-1.16] for depression, 0.94 [0.49-1.77] for suicide/suicidal ideation, and 1.03 [0.66-1.60] for psychosis.
No consistent long-term risk was seen, with meta-analytic HRs 0.94 [0.71-1.26] for depression, 0.77 [0.56-1.07] for suicide/suicidal ideation, and 0.99 [0.72-1.35] for psychosis.
ConclusionsHydroxychloroquine as used to treat RA does not appear to increase the risk of depression, suicide/suicidal ideation, or psychosis compared to sulfasalazine.
Use at higher dose or for different indications needs further investigation.

The impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission across 130 countries and territories  IntroductionNon-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are used to reduce transmission of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
However, empirical evidence of the effectiveness of specific NPIs has been inconsistent.
We assessed the effectiveness of NPIs around internal containment and closure, international travel restrictions, economic measures, and health system actions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 130 countries and territories.
MethodsWe used panel (longitudinal) regression to estimate the effectiveness of 13 categories of NPIs in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission with data from January - June 2020.
First, we examined the temporal association between NPIs using hierarchical cluster analyses.
We then regressed the time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 against different NPIs.
We examined different model specifications to account for the temporal lag between NPIs and changes in Rt, levels of NPI intensity, time-varying changes in NPI effect and variable selection criteria.
ResultsThere was strong evidence for an association between two NPIs (school closure, internal movement restrictions) and reduced Rt.
Another three NPIs (workplace closure, income support and debt/contract relief) had strong evidence of effectiveness when ignoring their level of intensity, while two NPIs (public events cancellation, restriction on gatherings) had strong evidence of their effectiveness only when evaluating their implementation at maximum capacity (e.g., restrictions on 1000+ people gathering were not effective, restrictions on <10 people gathering was).
Evidence supporting the effectiveness of the remaining NPIs (stay-at-home requirements, public information campaigns, public transport closure, international travel controls, testing, contact tracing) was inconsistent and inconclusive.
We found temporal clustering between many of the NPIs.
ConclusionUnderstanding the impact that specific NPIs have had on SARS-CoV-2 transmission is complicated by temporal clustering, time-dependent variation in effects and differences in NPI intensity.
However, the effectiveness of school closure and internal movement restrictions appears robust across different model specifications taking into account these effects, with some evidence that other NPIs may also be effective under particular conditions.
Estimating the local spatio-temporal distribution of disease from routine health information systems: the case of malaria in rural Madagascar  BackgroundReliable surveillance systems are essential for identifying disease outbreaks and allocating resources to ensure universal access to diagnostics and treatment for endemic diseases.
Yet, most countries with high disease burdens rely entirely on facility-based passive surveillance systems, which miss the vast majority of cases in rural settings with low access to health care.
This is especially true for malaria, for which the World Health Organization estimates that routine surveillance detects only 14% of global cases.
The goal of this study was to estimate the unobserved burden of malaria missed by routine passive surveillance in a rural district of Madagascar to produce realistic incidence estimates across space and time, less sensitive to heterogeneous health care access.
MethodsWe use a geographically explicit dataset of the 73,022 malaria cases confirmed at health centers in the Ifanadiana District in Madagascar from 2014 to 2017.
Malaria incidence was adjusted to account for underreporting due to stock-outs of rapid diagnostic tests and variable access to healthcare.
A benchmark multiplier was combined with a health care utilization index obtained from statistical models of non-malaria patients.
Separate analyses were carried out for individuals of all ages and for children under five.
The most plausible sets of estimates were then identified based on these criteria.
ResultsPassive surveillance was estimated to have missed about 4 in every 5 malaria cases among all individuals and 2 out of every 3 cases among children under five.
Adjusted malaria estimates were less biased by differences in populations financial and geographic access to care.
Average adjusted monthly malaria incidence was nearly four times higher during the high transmission season than during the low transmission season.
Geographic distribution in the adjusted dataset revealed high transmission clusters in low elevation areas in the northeast and southeast of the district that were stable across seasons and transmission years.
ConclusionsUnderstanding local disease dynamics from routine passive surveillance data can be a key step towards achieving universal access to diagnostics and treatment.
Methods presented here could be scaled-up thanks to the increasing availability of e-health disease surveillance platforms for malaria and other diseases across the developing world.
Responsible modelling: Unit testing for infectious disease epidemiology  Infectious disease epidemiology is increasingly reliant on large-scale computation and inference.
Models have guided health policy for epidemics including COVID-19 and Ebola and endemic diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis.
Unit testing is a coding method to avoid such bugs, but unit testing is rarely used in epidemiology.
An estimate of the COVID-19 infection fatality rate in Brazil based on a seroprevalence survey  We infer the infection fatality ratio (IFR) of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil by combining three datasets.
We compute the prevalence via the population-based seroprevalence survey EPICOVID19-BR.
For the fatalities we obtain the absolute number using the public Painel Coronavirus dataset and the age-relative number using the public SIVEP-Gripe dataset.
The time delay between the development of antibodies and subsequent fatality is estimated via the SIVEP-Gripe dataset.
We obtain the IFR via Bayesian inference for each survey stage and 27 federal states.
We include the effect of fading IgG antibody levels by marginalizing over the time after contagion at which the test gives a negative result with a flat prior on the interval [40, 80] days.
We infer a country-wide average IFR (maximum posterior and 95% CI) of 0.97% (0.82-1.14%) and age-specific IFR: 0.028% (0.024-0.036%) [< 30 years], 0.21% (0.17-0.25%) [30-49 years], 1.06% (0.88-1.31%) [50-69 years], 2.9% (2.5-3.7%) [[&ge;] 70 years].

Inferring person-to-person networks of pathogen transmission: is routine surveillance data up to the task?
Inference of person-to-person transmission networks using surveillance data is increasingly used to estimate spatiotemporal patterns of pathogen transmission.
Several data types can be used to inform transmission network inferences, yet the sensitivity of those inferences to different data types is not routinely evaluated.
We evaluated the influence of different combinations of spatial, temporal, and travel-history data on transmission network inferences for Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
Only when outbreaks were temporally focal or travel histories were accurate was the algorithm able to accurately estimate the reproduction number under control, Rc.
Applying this approach to data from Eswatini indicated that inferences of Rc and spatiotemporal patterns therein depend upon the choice of data types and assumptions about travel-history data.
These results suggest that transmission network inferences made with routine malaria surveillance data should be interpreted with caution.

Spatiotemporal dynamics of dengue in Colombia in relation to the combined effects of local climate and ENSO  Dengue virus (DENV) is an endemic disease in the hot and humid low-lands of Colombia.
We characterize diverse temporal and spatial patterns of monthly series of dengue incidence in diverse regions of Colombia during the period 2007-2017 at different spatial scales, and their association with indices of El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) at the tropical Pacific and local climatic variables.
For estimation purposes, we use linear analysis tools including lagged cross-correlations (Pearson test), cross wavelet analysis (wavelet cross spectrum, and wavelet coherence), as well as a novel nonlinear causality method, PCMCI, that allows identifying common causal drivers and links among high dimensional simultaneous and time-lagged variables.
Our results evidence the strong association of DENV cases in Colombia with ENSO indices and with local temperature and rainfall.
El Nino (La Nina) phenomenon is related to an increase (decrease) of dengue cases nationally and in most regions and departments, with maximum correlations occurring at shorter time lags in the Pacific and Andes regions, closer to the Pacific Ocean.
This association is mainly explained by the ENSO-driven increase in temperature and decrease in rainfall, especially in the Andes and Pacific regions.
The influence of ENSO is not stationary (there is a reduction of DENV cases since 2005) and local climate variables vary in space and time, which prevents to extrapolate results from one site to another.
The association between DENV and ENSO varies at national and regional scales when data are disaggregated by seasons, being stronger in DJF and weaker in SON.
Specific regions (Pacific and Andes) control the overall relationship between dengue dynamics and ENSO at national scale, and the departments of Antioquia and Valle del Cauca determine those of the Andes and Pacific regions, respectively.
Cross wavelet analysis indicates that the ENSO-DENV relation in Colombia exhibits a strong coherence in the 12 to 16-months frequency band, which implies the frequency locking between the annual cycle and the interannual (ENSO) timescales.
Results of nonlinear causality metrics reveal the complex concomitant effects of ENSO and local climate variables, while offering new insights to develop early warning systems for DENV in Colombia.
Strong gene dose dependent protective effect of Mediterranean type glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency against Plasmodium vivax malaria  BackgroundX-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common human enzymopathy.
The severe Mediterranean variant (G6PDd Med) is common across Europe and Asia.
Epidemiological studies investigating the potential protective effect of G6PD deficiency against malaria have yielded conflicting results.
MethodsG6PDd Med genotyping was performed in Pashtun patients in Afghanistan with acute Plasmodium vivax malaria and Pashtun subjects attending the same study centres with unrelated conditions or for routine vaccinations.
A Bayesian statistical model assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was used to estimate the potential protective effects of G6PDd Med on vivax malaria, and was fitted to all available data from this and previous studies.
FindingsIn patients with vivax malaria 1.6% (5 of 308) of males were G6PD Med hemizygotes compared with 8.2% (28 of 342) of controls (risk ratio; 95% confidence interval: 0.198 [0.078 to 0.507]), and 6.8% (31 of 458) of female patients were heterozygotes compared with 11.2% (40 of 358) of controls (RR 0.606 [0.387 to 0.948]).
From all available data, the estimated allele frequency of G6PDd Med in the Pasthun is 8.8% (95% credible interval, 7.5-10.2).
In hemizygous males and homozygous females, G6PDd Med confers a strong protective effect against symptomatic P. vivax malaria reducing the incidence by 73% (95% C.I.
In heterozygous females the estimated protective effect was 56% (95% C.I.
The protective effect in heterozygous females is 0.78 (95% CI, 1.09-0.53) of that observed in hemizygous males and homozygous females.
InterpretationThe G6PD Mediterranean genotype confers a very large and gene dose proportional protective effect against vivax malaria.
The proportion of patients with vivax malaria at risk of haemolysis following 8-aminoquinoline radical cure is substantially overestimated by epidemiological studies in healthy subjects.
Effectiveness of smartphone-based Community Case Management on urgent referral, re-consultation and hospitalization of children under-5 in Malawi: Results of a cluster-randomized, stepped-wedge trial  BackgroundIntegrated community case management (CCM) has led to reductions in child mortality in Malawi from illnesses such as malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea.
However, adherence to CCM guidelines is often poor, potentially leading to inappropriate clinical decisions and outcomes.
We determined the impact of an electronic version of CCM (eCCM) application on referral, re-consultation and hospitalization rates of children presenting to village clinics in Malawi.
MethodsA stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial compared paper-based CCM (control) with and without use of an eCCM app on smartphones from November 2016 to April 2017.A total of 102 village clinics from two districts in Northern Malawi were assigned to one of six clusters which were randomized to the sequencing of crossover from the control to the intervention phases, as well as the duration of exposure in each phase.
Children [&ge;]2 months to <5 years presenting with acute illness were enrolled consecutively by Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs).
The primary outcome of urgent referrals to higher-level facilities was evaluated using multi-level mixed effects models.
A logistic regression model with random effect of cluster and fixed effect for each step was fitted.
Calendar time was adjusted for in the analysis.
ResultsA total of 6965 children were recruited, 3421 in the control and 3544 in the intervention phase.
After adjusting for calendar time, children in the intervention phase were more likely to be urgently referred to a higher-level health facility compared with children in the control phase (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.27-3.23; p<0.01).
Overall, children in the intervention arm had lower odds of attending a repeat HSA consultation (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.34-0.59; p<0.01) or hospital admission (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.90; p<0.01), but after adjusting for time these differences were not significant (p>0.05).
ConclusionsAddition of eCCM decision support led to a greater proportion of children being referred to higher-level facilities, with no apparent increase in hospital admissions or repeat consultations in village clinics.
Our findings provide support for the implementation of eCCM tools in Malawi and other Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC), with a need for ongoing assessment of effectiveness and integration with national digital health strategies.

Diverse outcomes of controlled human malaria infection originate from host-intrinsic immune variation and not var gene switching  Falciparum malaria is clinically heterogeneous and the relative contribution of parasite and host in shaping disease severity remains unclear.
We explored the interaction between inflammation and parasite variant surface antigen (VSA) expression, asking whether this relationship underpins the variation observed in controlled human malaria infection (CHMI).
We uncovered marked heterogeneity in the response of naive hosts to blood challenge; some volunteers remained quiescent, others triggered interferon-stimulated inflammation and some showed transcriptional evidence of myeloid cell suppression.
Significantly, only inflammatory volunteers experienced hallmark symptoms of malaria.
When we tracked temporal changes in parasite VSA expression to ask whether variants associated with severe disease preferentially expand in naive hosts (as predicted by current theory) we found that var gene profiles were unchanged after 10-days of infection.
The diverse outcomes of CHMI therefore depend upon human immune variation and there is no evidence for switching or selection of var genes in naive hosts.
A Comparative Study to Find a Suitable Model for an Improved Real-Time Monitoring of The Interventions to Contain COVID-19 Outbreak in The High Incidence States of India  Background On March 11, 2020, The World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a global pandemic.
One such vital metrics for monitoring the transmission trends over time is the time-dependent effective reproduction number (Rt).
Rt is an estimate of secondary cases caused by an infected individual at a time during the outbreak, given that a certain population proportion is already infected.
Misestimated Rt is particularly concerning when probing the association between the changes in transmission rate and the changes in the implemented policies.
In this paper, we substantiate the implementation of the instantaneous reproduction number (Rins) method over the conventional method to estimate Rt viz case reproduction number (Rcase), by unmasking the real-time estimation ability of both methodologies using credible datasets.
Materials & Methods We employed the daily incidence dataset of COVID-19 for India and high incidence states to estimate Rins and Rcase.
We compared the real-time projection obtained through these methods by corroborating those states that are containing a high number of COVID19 cases and are conducting high and efficient COVID-19 testing.
The Rins and Rcase were estimated using R0 and EpiEstim packages respectively in R software 4.0.0.
Results Although, both the Rins and Rcase for the selected states were higher during the lockdown phases (March 25 - June 1, 2020) and subsequently stabilizes co-equally during the unlock phase (June 1- August 23, 2020), Rins demonstrated variations in accordance with the interventions while Rcase remained generalized and under- & overestimated.
A larger difference in Rins and Rcase estimates were also observed for states that are conducting high testing.
Conclusion Of the two methods, Rins elucidated a better real-time progression of the COVID-19 outbreak conceptually and empirically, than that of Rcase.
The potential impact of intervention strategies on COVID-19 transmission in Malawi: A mathematical modelling study  BackgroundCOVID-19 mitigation strategies have been challenging to implement in resource-limited settings such as Malawi due to the potential for widespread disruption to social and economic well-being.
Here we estimate the clinical severity of COVID-19 in Malawi, quantifying the potential impact of intervention strategies and increases in health system capacity.
MethodsThe infection fatality ratios (IFR) in Malawi were estimated by adjusting reported IFR for China accounting for demography, the current prevalence of comorbidities and health system capacity.
The impact of a novel therapeutic agent and increases in hospital capacity and oxygen availability were explored, given different assumptions on mortality rates.
FindingsThe estimated age-specific IFR in Malawi are higher than those reported for China, however the younger average age of the population results in a slightly lower population-weighted IFR (0.48%, 95% uncertainty interval [UI] 0.30% - 0.72% compared with 0.60%, 95% CI 0.4% - 1.3% in China).
The current interventions implemented, (i.e.
social distancing, workplace closures and public transport restrictions) could potentially avert 3,100 deaths (95% UI 1,500 - 4,500) over the course of the epidemic.
Enhanced shielding of people aged [&ge;] 60 years could avert a further 30,500 deaths (95% UI 17,500 - 45,600) and halve ICU admissions at the peak of the outbreak.
Coverage of face coverings of 60% under the assumption of 50% efficacy could be sufficient to control the epidemic.
A novel therapeutic agent, which reduces mortality by 0.65 and 0.8 for severe and critical cases respectively, in combination with increasing hospital capacity could reduce projected mortality to 2.55 deaths per 1,000 population (95% UI 1.58 - 3.84).
ConclusionThe risks due to COVID-19 vary across settings and are influenced by age, underlying health and health system capacity.
Summary BoxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known?C_ST_ABSO_LIAs COVID-19 spreads throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, countries are under increasing pressure to protect the most vulnerable by suppressing spread through, for example, stringent social distancing measures or shielding of those at highest risk away from the general population.
C_LIO_LIThere are a number of studies estimating infection fatality ratio due to COVID-19 but none use data from African settings.
The estimated IFR varies across settings ranging between 0.28-0.99%, with higher values estimated for Europe (0.77%, 95% CI 0.55 - 0.99%) compared with Asia (0.46%, 95% CI 0.38 - 0.55).
C_LIO_LIThe IFR for African settings are still unknown, although several studies have highlighted the potential for increased mortality due to comorbidities such as HIV, TB and malaria.
C_LIO_LIThere are a small number of studies looking at the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions in Africa, particularly South Africa, but none to date have combined this with country-specific estimates of IFR adjusted for comorbidity prevalence and with consideration to the prevailing health system constraints and the impact of these constraints on mortality rates.
C_LI  What are the new findings?O_LIAfter accounting for the health system constraints and differing prevalences of underlying comorbidities, the estimated infection fatality ratio (IFR) for Malawi (0.48%, 95% uncertainty interval 0.30% - 0.72%) is within the ranges reported for the Americas, Asia and Europe (overall IFR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57 - 0.82, range 0.28 - 0.89).
C_LIO_LIIntroducing enhanced shielding of people aged [&ge;] 60 years could avert up to 30,500 deaths (95% UI 17,500 - 45,600) and significantly reduce demand on ICU admissions.
C_LIO_LIMaintaining coverage of face coverings at 60%, under the assumption of 50% efficacy, could be sufficient to control the epidemic.
C_LIO_LICombining the introduction of a novel therapeutic agent with increases in hospital capacity could reduce projected mortality to 2.55 deaths per 1,000 population (95% UI 1.58 - 3.84).

Predicting dengue in the Philippines using artificial neural network  Dengue fever is an infectious disease caused by Flavivirus transmitted by Aedes mosquito.
This disease predominantly occurs in the tropical and subtropical regions.
With no specific treatment, the most effective way to prevent dengue is vector control.
The dependence of Aedes mosquito population on meteorological variables make prediction of dengue infection possible using conventional statistical and epidemiologic models.
This study uses artificial neural network to predict dengue incidence in the entire Philippines with humidity, rainfall, and temperature as independent variables.
All generated predictive models have mean squared logarithmic error of less than 0.04.
Analysis of the potential for a malaria vaccine to reduce gaps in malaria intervention coverage  BackgroundThe RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine is currently being piloted in three African countries.
We sought to identify whether vaccination could reach additional children who are at risk from malaria but do not currently have access to, or use, core malaria interventions.
MethodsUsing data from household surveys we calculated the overlap between malaria intervention coverage and childhood vaccination (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis dose 3, DTP3) uptake in 20 African countries with at least one first administrative level unit with Plasmodium falciparum parasite prevalence greater than 10%.
We used multilevel logistic regression to explore patterns of overlap by demographic and socioeconomic variables.
We also estimated the public health impact of delivering RTS,S/AS01 to those children who do not use an insecticide-treated net (ITN) but who received the DTP3 vaccine.
ResultsUptake of DTP3 was higher than malaria intervention coverage in most countries.
Overall, 34% of children did not use ITNs and received DTP3, while 35% of children used ITNs and received DTP3, although this breakdown varied by country.
We estimated that there are 33 million children in these 20 countries who do not use an ITN.
Of these, 23 million (70%) received the DTP3 vaccine.
Vaccinating those 23 million children who receive DTP3 but do not use an ITN could avert an estimated 9.7 million clinical malaria cases each year.
An additional 10.8 million cases could be averted by vaccinating those 24 million children who receive the vaccine and use an ITN.
Children who had access to or used an ITN were 9 to 13% more likely to reside in rural areas compared to those who had neither intervention regardless of vaccination status.
Mothers education status was a strong predictor of intervention uptake and was positively associated with use of ITNs and vaccination uptake and negatively associated with having access to an ITN but not using it.
Wealth was also a strong predictor of intervention coverage.
ConclusionsChildhood vaccination to prevent malaria has the potential to reduce inequity in access to existing malaria interventions and could substantially reduce the childhood malaria burden in sub-Saharan Africa, even in regions with lower existing DTP3 coverage.
The impacts of COVID-19 mitigation on dengue virus transmission: a modelling study  BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has induced unprecedented reductions in human mobility and social contacts throughout the world.
Because dengue virus (DENV) transmission is strongly driven by human mobility, behavioral changes associated with the pandemic have been hypothesized to impact dengue incidence.
By discouraging human contact, COVID-19 control measures have also disrupted dengue vector control interventions, the most effective of which require entry into homes.
MethodWe used an agent-based model with a realistic treatment of human mobility and vector control to investigate how and why dengue incidence could differ under a lockdown scenario with a proportion of the population sheltered at home.
ResultWe found that a lockdown in which 70% of the population sheltered at home led to a small average increase in cumulative DENV infections of up to 10%, depending on the time of year lockdown occurred.
Lockdown had a more pronounced effect on the spatial distribution of DENV infections, with higher incidence under lockdown in regions with high mosquito abundance.
Transmission was also more focused in homes following lockdown.
The proportion of people infected in their own home rose from 54% under normal conditions to 66% under lockdown, and the household secondary attack rate rose from 0.109 to 0.128, a 17% increase.
DiscussionOur results indicate that an unintended outcome of COVID-19 control measures may be to adversely alter the epidemiology of dengue.
This observation has important implications for an improved understanding of dengue epidemiology and effective application of dengue vector control.
Climatic and socio-economic factors supporting the co-circulation of dengue, Zika and chikungunya in three different ecosystems in Colombia  Dengue, Zika and chikungunya are diseases of global health significance caused by arboviruses and transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti of worldwide circulation.
The arrival of the Zika and chikungunya viruses to South America increased the complexity of transmission and morbidity caused by these viruses co-circulating in the same vector mosquito species.
Here we present an integrated analysis of the reported arbovirus cases between 2007 and 2017 and local climate and socio-economic profiles of three distinct Colombian municipalities (Bello, Cucuta and Moniquira).
These locations were confirmed as three different ecosystems given their contrasted geographic, climatic and socio-economic profiles.
Correlational analyses were conducted with both generalised linear models and generalised additive models for the geographical data.
Average temperature and wind speed were strongly correlated with disease incidence.
The transmission of Zika during the 2016 epidemic appeared to decrease circulation of dengue in Cucuta, an area of sustained high incidence of dengue.
Socio-economic factors such as barriers to health and childhood services, inadequate sanitation and poor water supply suggested an unfavourable impact on the transmission of dengue, Zika and chikungunya in all three ecosystems.
Socio-demographic influencers were also discussed including the influx of people to Cucuta, fleeing political and economic instability from neighbouring Venezuela.
Aedes aegypti is expanding its range and increasing the global threat of these diseases.
It is therefore vital that we learn from the epidemiology of these arboviruses and translate it into an actionable knowledge base.
This is even more acute given the recent historical high of dengue cases in the Americas in 2019, preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, which is itself hampering mosquito control efforts.
Author summaryViruses transmitted by Ae.
aegypti mosquitoes (dengue, Zika, chikungunya) are amongst the most significant public health concerns of recent years due to the increase in global cases and the rapid spread of the vectors.
Understanding factors associated with risk of these viruses is key for informing control programmes and predicting when outbreaks may occur.
Areas of high poverty have abundance of suitable habitat for Ae.
aegypti (e.g.
This study investigated the factors effecting arbovirus incidence in three distinct regions of Colombia: Bello, Cucuta and Moniquira.
A decline in dengue following outbreaks of Zika (2016) is also reported.
Measures of poverty, including critical overcrowding and no access to improved water source were also found to be higher in areas of higher disease incidence.
The results of this study highlight the importance of using a multifactorial approach when designing vector control programs in order to effectively distribute health care resources.
A COVID-19 Model for Local Authorities of the United Kingdom  We propose a new framework to model the COVID-19 epidemic of the United Kingdom at the level of local authorities.
The model fits within a general framework for semi-mechanistic Bayesian models of the epidemic, with some important innovations: we model the proportion of infections that result in reported deaths and cases as random variables.
This is in contrast to standard frameworks that model the latent infection as a deterministic function of time varying reproduction number, Rt.
The model is tailored and designed to be updated daily based on publicly available data.
We envisage the model to be useful for now-casting and short-term projections of the epidemic as well as estimating historical trends.
Predicting Trends of Coronavirus Disease (COVID19) Using SIRD and Gaussian-SIRD Models  Eruption of COVID-19 patients in 215 countries worldwide have urged for robust predictive methods that can detect as early as possible size and duration of the contagious disease and also providing precision predictions.
In many recent literatures reported on COVID-19, one or more essential parts of such investigation were missed.
One of crucial elements for any predictive method is that such methods should fit simultaneously as many data as possible; these data could be total infected cases, daily hospitalized cases, cumulative recovered cases and deceased cases and so on.
Other crucial elements include sensitivity and precision of such predictive methods on amount of data as the contagious disease evolved day by day.
To show importance of these aspects, we have evaluated the standard SIRD model and a newly introduced Gaussian-SIRD model on development of COVID-19 in Kuwait.
It is observed that SIRD model quickly pick up main trends of COVID-19 development; but Gaussian-SIRD model provides precise prediction at longer period of time.
Knowledge, attitude and willingness to accept the RTS,S malaria vaccine among mothers in Abuja Nigeria  ObjectiveTo assess mothers knowledge, attitude, and practices to malaria and its prevention as well as mothers willingness to accept the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine.
MethodsA cross-sectional study design was used to administer questionnaires to 180 mothers within six public secondary health facilities in Abuja, Nigeria.
Regression analyses were used to assess the effect of maternal demographics and exposure to malaria related messages on the outcome measures.
ResultsKnowledge of malaria preventive measures was approximately 59% (124/180).
Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated ethnicity, education and number of messages or training on malaria were associated with mothers knowledge of 3 or more preventive measures against malaria.
About 30% (36/180) of respondents were aware of malaria vaccines but only four percent (7/180) had heard of RTS,S.
Young maternal age (OR, 2.4; p = 0.03), self-employment (OR, 2.55; p = 0.04) and formal employment (OR, 3.74; p = 0.03) were associated with no prior knowledge of malaria vaccine.
Ninety-one percent (163/180) had positive attitude to malaria vaccine and 98% (176/180) were willing to allow their child(ren) to be immunized with RTS,S despite the efficacy of the vaccine, route of administration and number of doses.
ConclusionKnowledge of malaria preventive measures does not correlate with knowledge of RTS,S.
Seroconversion stages COVID19 into distinct pathophysiological states  COVID19 is a heterogeneous medical condition involving a suite of underlying pathophysiological processes including hyperinflammation, endothelial damage, thrombotic microangiopathy, and end-organ damage.
Limited knowledge about the molecular mechanisms driving these processes and lack of staging biomarkers hamper the ability to stratify patients for targeted therapeutics.
We report here the results of a cross-sectional multi-omics analysis of hospitalized COVID19 patients revealing that seroconversion status associates with distinct underlying pathophysiological states.
Seronegative COVID19 patients harbor hyperactive T cells and NK cells, high levels of IFN alpha, gamma and lambda ligands, markers of systemic complement activation, neutropenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia.
In seropositive patients, all of these processes are attenuated, observing instead increases in B cell subsets, emergency hematopoiesis, increased markers of platelet activation, and hypoalbuminemia.
We propose that seroconversion status could potentially be used as a biosignature to stratify patients for therapeutic intervention and to inform analysis of clinical trial results in heterogenous patient populations.
Amplicon contamination in labs masquerades as COVID19 in surveillance tests  A cohort of laboratorians with positive SARS-CoV2 test results were uncovered during asymptomatic COVID-19 screening programs at six universities.
Follow-up PCR and antibody tests showed that most of these cases were not true COVID-19 infection but instead arose from reverse-transcribed and amplified viral sequences (amplicons) that are generated during research.
Environmental testing showed widespread contamination of amplicons in lab spaces including notebooks, keyboards, glasses, and doorknobs.
Minimizing instances of amplicon contamination and developing protocols for handling suspected cases are critical to propel research efforts and to avoid diverting university and healthcare resources from patients with COVID-19.
Ivermectin shows clinical benefits in mild to moderate Covid19 disease: A randomised controlled double blind dose response study in Lagos.
IntroductionIn vitro studies have shown the efficacy of Ivermectin (IV) to inhibit the SARS - CoV-2 viral replication, but questions remained as to In-vivo applications.
We set out to explore the efficacy and safety of Ivermectin in persons infected with COVID19.
MethodsWe conducted a translational proof of concept (PoC) randomized, double blind placebo controlled, dose response, parallel group study of IV efficacy in RT - PCR proven COVID 19 positive patients.
62 patients were randomized to 3 treatment groups.
(A) IV 6mg regime, (B)IV 12 mg regime (given Q84hrs for 2weeks) (C, control) Lopinavir/Ritonavir.
ResultsThe Days to COVID negativity [DTN] was significantly and dose dependently reduced by IV (p = 0.0066).
The DTN for Control were, = 9.1+/-5.2, for A 6.0 +/- 2.9, and for B 4.6 +/-3.2.
2 Way repeated measures ANOVA of ranked COVID 19 + / - scores at 0, 84, 168, 232 hours showed a significant IV treatment effect (p=0.035) and time effect (p <0.0001).
IV also tended to increase SPO2 % compared to controls, p = 0.073, 95% CI - 0.39 to 2.59 and increased platelet count compared to C (p = 0.037) 95%CI 5.55 - 162.55 x 103/ml.
The platelet count increase was inversely correlated to DTN (r = -0.52, p = 0.005).
No SAE was reported.
Conclusions12 mg IV regime may have superior efficacy.
IV should be considered for use in clinical management of SARS-Cov-2, and may find applications in community prophylaxis in high-risk areas.
A Novel Abnormality Annotation Database for COVID-19 Affected Frontal Lung X-rays  PurposeTo advance the usage of CXRs as a viable solution for efficient COVID-19 diagnostics by providing large-scale annotations of the abnormalities in frontal CXRs in BIMCV-COVID19+ database, and to provide a robust evaluation mechanism to facilitate its usage.
Materials and MethodsWe provide the abnormality annotations in frontal CXRs by creating bounding boxes.
The frontal CXRs are a part of the existing BIMCV-COVID19+ database.
Finally, we benchmark the defined protocols and report the results using popular deep learning models as a part of this study.
ResultsFor semantic segmentation, Mask-RCNN performs the best among all the models with a DICE score of 0.43 {+/-} 0.01.
For classification, we observe that MobileNetv2 yields the best results for 2-class and 3-class classification.
We also observe that deep models report a lower performance for classifying other classes apart from the COVID class.
ConclusionBy making the annotated data and protocols available to the scientific community, we aim to advance the usage of CXRs as a viable solution for efficient COVID-19 diagnostics.
This large-scale data will be useful for ML algorithms and can be used for learning radiological patterns observed in COVID-19 patients.
Further, the protocols will facilitate ML practitioners for unified large-scale evaluation of their algorithms.

The cellular immune response to COVID-19 deciphered by single cell multi-omics across three UK centres  The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in excess morbidity and mortality as well as economic decline.
To characterise the systemic host immune response to SARS-CoV-2, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing coupled with analysis of cell surface proteins, providing molecular profiling of over 800,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a cohort of 130 patients with COVID-19.
Our cohort, from three UK centres, spans the spectrum of clinical presentations and disease severities ranging from asymptomatic to critical.
Three control groups were included: healthy volunteers, patients suffering from a non-COVID-19 severe respiratory illness and healthy individuals administered with intravenous lipopolysaccharide to model an acute inflammatory response.
Full single cell transcriptomes coupled with quantification of 188 cell surface proteins, and T and B lymphocyte antigen receptor repertoires have provided several insights into COVID-19: 1. a new non-classical monocyte state that sequesters platelets and replenishes the alveolar macrophage pool; 2. platelet activation accompanied by early priming towards megakaryopoiesis in immature haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and expansion of megakaryocyte-primed progenitors; 3. increased clonally expanded CD8+ effector:effector memory T cells, and proliferating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in patients with more severe disease; and 4. relative increase of IgA plasmablasts in asymptomatic stages that switches to expansion of IgG plasmablasts and plasma cells, accompanied with higher incidence of BCR sharing, as disease severity increases.

Together, these data detail the cellular processes present in peripheral blood during an acute immune response to COVID-19, and serve as a template for multi-omic single cell data integration across multiple centers to rapidly build powerful resources to help combat diseases such as COVID-19.
Estimating COVID-19 Cases on University Campuses Prior To Semester  For many institutions of higher learning, the beginning of each semester is marked by a significant migration of young adults into the area.
In the midst of the COVID19 pandemic, this presents an opportunity for active cases to be introduced into a community.
Prior to the Fall 2020 semester, Colorado State University researchers combined student home locations with recent case counts compiled by the New York Times to assign a probability to each individual of arriving with COVID19.
These probabilities were combined to estimate that there would be 7.8 new cases among the on-campus population.
Comprehensive testing of arriving students revealed 7 new cases, which validated the approach.
The procedure was repeated to explore what could happen if students had returned to campus after Fall break.
The estimate of 48 cases corroborated the Universitys early decision to transition to fully remote learning after break.
Site-specific biases in phase-III clinical trials underestimate the effect of radical cure against Plasmodium vivax hypnozoites  Plasmodium vivax relapses caused by reactivating hypnozoites are a major barrier for elimination and control of this form of malaria.
Radical cure is a form of therapy capable of addressing this problem.
We performed an analysis of simulated trial data using a transmission model to demonstrate that variation in efficacy estimates across trial sites can arise from differences in the conditions under which trials are conducted.
Our analysis revealed that differences in transmission intensity, heterogeneous exposure, and relapse rate can yield efficacy estimates ranging as wide as 12-78%, despite simulating trial data under the uniform assumption that treatment had a 75% chance of clearing hypnozoites.
A longer duration of prophylaxis leads to a greater measured efficacy, particularly at higher transmission intensities, making the comparison of the protection of different radical cure treatment regimens against relapse more challenging.
We show that vector control and parasite genotyping offer two potential means to yield more standardized efficacy estimates that better reflect protection against relapse.
Future clinical trials can reduce site-specific biases by conducting trials in low-transmission settings where reinfections from mosquito biting are less common, by preventing reinfections using vector control measures, or by identifying and excluding likely reinfections that occur during follow-up using parasite genotyping methods.
AUTHOR SUMMARYRadical cure holds promise as a strategy for Plasmodium vivax malaria control by clearing the parasites known as hypnozoites that latently infect the liver and cause relapsing infections.
The efficacy of radical cure treatment regimens is evaluated in phase-III clinical trials.
Recent trial results have noted substantial variation in efficacy estimates across trial sites, complicating the interpretation of the benefit of radical cure.
However, P. vivax infections identified during the course of the clinical trial could include reinfections from mosquito biting that do not directly reflect the effect of the therapeutic being trialed, potentially biasing efficacy estimates.
We then demonstrated that vector control and parasite genotyping are two possible strategies to reduce these biases.

Automated detection and staging of malaria parasites from cytological smears using convolutional neural networks  Microscopic examination of blood smears remains the gold standard for diagnosis and laboratory studies with malaria.
Inspection of smears is, however, a tedious manual process dependent on trained microscopists with results varying in accuracy between individuals, given the heterogeneity of parasite cell form and disagreement on nomenclature.
To address this, we sought to develop an automated image analysis method that improves accuracy and standardisation of cytological smear inspection but retains the capacity for expert confirmation and archiving of images.
Here we present a machine-learning method that achieves red blood cell (RBC) detection, differentiation between infected and uninfected RBCs and parasite life stage categorisation from raw, unprocessed heterogeneous images of thin blood films.
The method uses a pre-trained Faster Region-Based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN) model for RBC detection that performs accurately, with an average precision of 0.99 at an intersection-over-union threshold of 0.5.
A residual neural network (ResNet)-50 model applied to detect infection in segmented RBCs also performs accurately, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.98.
Lastly, using a regression model our method successfully recapitulates intra-erythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC) stages with accurate categorisation (ring, trophozoite, schizont), as well as differentiating asexual stages from gametocytes.
To accelerate our methods utility, we have developed a mobile-friendly web-based interface, PlasmoCount, which is capable of automated detection and staging of malaria parasites from uploaded heterogeneous input images of Giemsa-stained thin blood smears.
Results gained using either laboratory or phone-based images permit rapid navigation through and review of results for quality assurance.
By standardising the assessment of parasite development from microscopic blood smears, PlasmoCount markedly improves user consistency and reproducibility and thereby presents a realistic route to automating the gold standard of field-based malaria diagnosis.
Significance StatementMicroscopy inspection of Giemsa-stained thin blood smears on glass slides has been used in the diagnosis of malaria and monitoring of malaria cultures in laboratory settings for >100 years.
Manual evaluation is, however, time-consuming, error-prone and subjective with no currently available tool that permits reliable automated counting and archiving of Giemsa-stained images.
Here, we present a machine learning method for automated detection and staging of parasite infected red cells from heterogeneous smears.
Our method calculates parasitaemia and frequency data on the malaria parasite intraerythrocytic development cycle directly from raw images, standardizing smear assessment and providing reproducible and archivable results.
Developed into a web tool, PlasmoCount, this method provides improved standardisation of smear inspection for malaria research and potentially field diagnosis.
Toward a geography of community health workers in Niger: a geospatial analysis  BackgroundLittle is known about the geography of community health workers (CHWs), their contribution to geographical accessibility of primary health care (PHC) services, and strategies for optimizing efficiency of CHW deployment in the context of universal health coverage (UHC).
MethodsUsing a complete georeferenced census of front-line health facilities and CHWs in Niger and other high resolution spatial datasets, we modelled travel times to front-line health facilities and CHWs between 2000-2013, accounting for training, essential commodities, and maximum population capacity.
We estimated additional CHWs needed to maximize geographical accessibility of the population beyond the reach of existing front-line health facilities and CHWs.
We assessed the efficiency of geographical targeting of the existing CHW network compared to modelled CHW networks designed to optimize geographical targeting of the estimated population, under-five deaths, and plasmodium falciparum malaria cases.
ResultsThe percent of the population within 60 minutes walking to the nearest CHW increased from 0{middle dot}0% to 17{middle dot}5% between 2000-2013, with 15{middle dot}5% within 60 minutes walking to the nearest CHW trained on integrated community case management (iCCM) - making PHC services and iCCM, specifically, geographically accessible for an estimated 2{middle dot}3 million and 2{middle dot}0 million additional people, respectively.
An estimated 10{middle dot}4 million people (59{middle dot}0%) remained beyond a 60-minute catchment of front-line health facilities and CHWs.
Optimal deployment of 8064 additional CHWs could increase geographic coverage of the estimated total population from 41{middle dot}5% to 73{middle dot}6%.
Geographical targeting of the existing CHW network was inefficient but optimized CHW networks could improve efficiency by 55{middle dot}0%-81{middle dot}9%, depending on targeting metric.
InterpretationsWe provide the first high-resolution maps and estimates of geographical accessibility to CHWs at national scale, highlighting improvements between 2000-2013 in Niger, geographies where gaps remained, approaches for improving targeting, and the importance of putting CHWs on the map to inform planning in the context of UHC.

Characteristics that modify the effect of small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplementation on child growth: an individual participant data meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials  BackgroundMeta-analyses have demonstrated that small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) reduce stunting and wasting prevalence among infants and young children.
Identification of subgroups who benefit most from SQ-LNS may facilitate program design.
ObjectiveOur objective was to identify study-level and individual-level modifiers of the effect of SQ-LNS on child growth outcomes.
MethodsWe conducted a two-stage meta-analysis of individual participant data from 14 randomized controlled trials of SQ-LNS provided to children 6 to 24 months of age in low- and middle-income countries (n=37,066).
We generated study-specific and subgroup estimates of SQ-LNS vs. control and pooled the estimates using fixed-effects models, with random-effects models as sensitivity analyses.
We used random effects meta-regression to examine study-level effect modifiers.
Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 and Tau2 statistics.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine whether results differed depending on inclusion criteria for arms within trials and types of comparisons.
ResultsSQ-LNS provision decreased stunting (length-for-age z-score < -2) by 12% (relative reduction), wasting (weight-for-length (WLZ) z-score < -2) by 14%, low mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC < 125 mm or MUACZ < -2) by 18%, acute malnutrition (WLZ < -2 or MUAC < 125 mm) by 14%, underweight (weight-for-age z-score < -2) by 13%, and small head size (head-circumference z-score < -2) by 9%.
Effects of SQ-LNS on growth outcomes generally did not differ by study-level characteristics including region, stunting burden, malaria prevalence, sanitation, water quality, duration of supplementation, frequency of contact or average reported compliance with SQ-LNS.
Effects of SQ-LNS on stunting, wasting, low MUAC and small head size were greater among girls than among boys; effects on stunting, underweight and low MUAC were greater among later-born (vs. first-born) children; and effects on wasting and acute malnutrition were greater among children in households with improved (vs. unimproved) sanitation.
Effects of SQ-LNS on stunting, wasting, low MUAC and small head size were greater among girls than among boys; effects on stunting, underweight and low MUAC were greater among later-born (vs. first-born) children; and effects on wasting and acute malnutrition were greater among children in households with improved (vs. unimproved) sanitation.
ConclusionsThe positive impact of SQ-LNS on growth is apparent across a wide variety of study-level contexts.
Policy-makers and program planners should consider including SQ-LNS in the mix of interventions to prevent both stunting and wasting.

Small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements for prevention of child malnutrition and promotion of healthy development: Overview of individual participant data meta-analysis and programmatic implications  Small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) were designed to provide multiple micronutrients within a food base that also provides energy, protein and essential fatty acids, and were targeted towards the prevention of malnutrition in low- and middle-income countries.
Previous meta-analyses have demonstrated beneficial effects of SQ-LNS on child growth, anemia and mortality.
To further examine efficacy and effectiveness of SQ-LNS, and explore study-level and individual-level modifiers of the effects, we conducted an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of 14 randomized controlled trials of SQ-LNS provided to infants and young children 6 to 24 mo of age (n > 37,000).
We examined growth, development, anemia and micronutrient status outcomes.
Children who received SQ-LNS had a 12-14% lower prevalence of stunting, wasting and underweight, were 16-19% less likely to score in the lowest decile for language, social-emotional, and motor development, and had a 16% lower prevalence of anemia and 64% lower prevalence of iron-deficiency anemia, compared to control group children.
For most outcomes, beneficial effects of SQ-LNS were evident regardless of study-level characteristics including region, stunting burden, malaria prevalence, sanitation, water quality, duration of supplementation, frequency of contact or average reported compliance with SQ-LNS.
For certain outcomes, targeting based on population-level socioeconomic status or undernutrition may be worthwhile, as the benefits of SQ-LNS for iron status, anemia and child development were larger in sub-groups with a greater potential to benefit.
A greater impact of SQ-LNS might be possible by co-packaging it with interventions that reduce constraints on response, such as prevention and control of pre-and postnatal infections, improving maternal nutrition, improving health care access, and promotion of early child development.
Policy-makers and program planners should consider including SQ-LNS in strategies to reduce child mortality, stunting, wasting, anemia, iron deficiency and developmental impairments.

covid19.Explorer: A web application and R package to explore United States COVID-19 data  Appearing at the end of 2019, a novel virus (later identified as SARS-CoV-2) was characterized in the city of Wuhan in Hubei Province, China.
As of the time of writing, the disease caused by this virus (known as COVID-19) has already resulted in over 3 million deaths worldwide.
SARS-CoV-2 infections and deaths, however, have been highly unevenly distributed among age groups, sexes, countries, and jurisdictions over the course of the pandemic.
Herein, I present a tool (the covid19.Explorer R package and web application) that has been designed to explore and analyze publicly available United States COVID-19 infection and death data from the 2020/21 U.S. SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The analyses and visualizations that this R package and web application facilitate can help users better comprehend the geographic progress of the pandemic, the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (such as lockdowns and other measures, which have varied widely among U.S. states), and the relative risks posed by COVID-19 to different age groups within the U.S. population.

The end result is an interactive tool that will help its users develop an improved understanding of the temporal and geographic dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, accessible to lay people and scientists alike.
Impact of azithromycin mass drug administration on the antibiotic-resistant gut microbiome: a randomized, controlled trial  BackgroundMass drug administration (MDA) with azithromycin is the primary strategy for global trachoma control efforts.
Numerous studies have reported secondary effects of MDA with azithromycin, including reductions in childhood mortality, diarrhoeal disease and malaria.
Most recently, the MORDOR clinical trial demonstrated that MDA led to an overall reduction in all-cause childhood mortality in targeted communities.
There is however concern about the potential of increased antimicrobial resistance in treated communities.
MethodsThis study evaluated the impact of azithromycin MDA on the prevalence of gastrointestinal carriage of macrolide-resistant bacteria in communities within the MORDOR Malawi study, additionally profiling changes in the gut microbiome after treatment.
For faecal metagenomics, 60 children were sampled prior to treatment and 122 children after four rounds of MDA, half receiving azithromycin and half placebo.
FindingsThe proportion of bacteria carrying macrolide resistance increased after azithromycin treatment; the effect was enhanced in children treated within six months of sampling.
Diversity and global community structure of the gut was minimally impacted by treatment, however abundance of several species was altered by treatment.
Notably, the putative human enteropathogen Escherichia albertii was more abundant after treatment.
InterpretationThe impacts of MDA with azithromycin, including increased carriage of macrolide-resistant bacteria, were enhanced in children treated more recently, suggesting effects may be transient.
Increased abundance of enteropathogenic Escherichia species after treatment requires further, higher resolution investigation.
Future studies should focus on the number of treatments and administration schedule to ensure clinical benefits continue to outweigh costs in antimicrobial resistance carriage.

Efficacy of a Spatial Repellent for Control of Aedes-Borne Virus Transmission: A Cluster Randomized Trial in Iquitos, Peru  Over half the worlds population is at risk for viruses transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, such as, dengue and Zika.
Despite decades of effort, cases and geographic range of Aedes-borne viruses (ABV) continue to expand.
Rigorously proven vector control interventions that measure protective efficacy against ABV diseases is limited to Wolbachia in a single trial in Indonesia, and do not include any chemical intervention.
Spatial repellents, a new option for efficient deployment, are designed to decrease human exposure to ABV by releasing active ingredients into the air that disrupt mosquito-human contact.
A parallel, cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted in Iquitos, Peru to quantify the impact of a transfluthrin-based spatial repellent on human ABV infection.
From 2,907 households across 26 clusters (13 per arm), 1,578 participants were assessed for seroconversion (primary endpoint) by survival analysis.
Incidence of acute disease was calculated among 16,683 participants (secondary endpoint).
Adult mosquito collections were conducted to compare Ae.
aegypti abundance, blood-fed rate and parity status through mixed effect difference-in-difference analyses.
The spatial repellent significantly reduced ABV infection by 34{middle dot}1% (1-sided 95% CI lower limit, 6{middle dot}9%; 1-sided p-value=0{middle dot}0236, z=1{middle dot}98).
Aedes aegypti abundance and blood-fed rates were significantly reduced by 28{middle dot}6% (95% CI 24{middle dot}1%, {infty}); z=-9{middle dot}11) and 12{middle dot}4% (95% CI 4{middle dot}2%, {infty}); z=-2{middle dot}43), respectively.
Our trial provides the first conclusive statistical evidence from a pre-planned cluster randomized controlled clinical trial with a pre-defined effect size on the primary endpoint that was appropriate powered to prospectively quantify and statistically test for a difference in the impact of a chemical intervention, in this case a spatial repellent, to reduce the risk of ABV transmission compared to a placebo.
Significance StatementVector interventions are needed for Aedes-borne viral diseases (dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever) prevention, but their application is hindered by the lack of evidence proving they prevent infection or disease.
Our research reports the first conclusive statistical evidence from a pre-planned, prospective cluster-randomized, controlled clinical trial (cRCT) of significant protective efficacy (34.1% hazard estimate) against human Aedes-borne virus (ABV) infection by a chemical-based vector control intervention, the most commonly used intervention category among all ABV World Health Organization recommendations.
A previous trial against malaria in Indonesia indicated a positive trend but did not detect a significant effect.
A common TMPRSS2 variant protects against severe COVID-19  Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has a wide range of clinical presentations, from asymptomatic to life-threatening.
Old age is the strongest factor associated with increased COVID19-related mortality, followed by sex and pre-existing conditions.
The importance of genetic and immunological factors on COVID19 outcome is also starting to emerge, as demonstrated by population studies and the discovery of damaging variants in genes controlling type I IFN immunity and of autoantibodies that neutralize type I IFNs.
The human protein transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2) plays a key role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it is required to activate the virus spike protein, facilitating entry into target cells.
We focused on the only common TMPRSS2 non-synonymous variant predicted to be damaging (rs12329760), which has a minor allele frequency of [~]25% in the population.
In a large population of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, we show that this variant is associated with a reduced likelihood of developing severe COVID19 (OR 0.87, 95%CI:0.79-0.97, p=0.01).
This association was stronger in homozygous individuals when compared to the general population (OR 0.65, 95%CI:0.50-0.84, p=1.3x10-3).
We demonstrate in vitro that this variant, which causes the amino acid substitution valine to methionine, impacts the catalytic activity of TMPRSS2 and is less able to support SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated entry into cells.
TMPRSS2 rs12329760 is a common variant associated with a significantly decreased risk of severe COVID19.
Further studies are needed to assess the expression of the TMPRSS2 across different age groups.
Moreover, our results identify TMPRSS2 as a promising drug target, with a potential role for camostat mesilate, a drug approved for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis and postoperative reflux esophagitis, in the treatment of COVID19.
Effectiveness and safety of reactive focal mass drug administration (rfMDA) using dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine to reduce malaria transmission in very low-endemic setting of Eswatini: a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial  IntroductionTo reduce malaria transmission in very low-endemic settings, screening and treatment near index cases (reactive case detection (RACD)), is widely practiced, but the rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) used miss low-density infections.
Presumptive treatment near index cases (reactive focal mass drug administration (rfMDA)) may be safe and more effective.
MethodsWe conducted a cluster-randomised controlled trial in Eswatini, a very low-endemic setting.
77 clusters were randomised to rfMDA using dihydroartemisin-piperaquine (DP) or RACD involving RDTs and artemether lumefantrine (AL).
Interventions were delivered by the local programme.
An intention-to-treat analysis was used to compare cluster-level cumulative confirmed malaria incidence among clusters with cases.
ResultsFrom Sept 2015-Aug 2017, 220 index cases from 47 clusters triggered 49 RACD events and 68 rfMDA events.
RACD and rfMDA were delivered to 1696 and 1932 individuals, respectively.
Index case and target population intervention coverages for both arms were 75.6%-81.4% and adherence to DP was 98.7%.
For rfMDA versus RACD, cumulative incidences (per 1000 person-years) of all malaria were 2.11 (95% CI 1.73-2.59) and 1.97 (1.57-2.47), respectively; and of locally acquired malaria, they were 1.29 (95% CI 1.00-1.67) and 0.97 (0.71-1.34), respectively.
Adjusting for imbalance in baseline incidence, incidence rate ratio (aIRR) for rfMDA versus RACD was 0.93 (95% CI 0.54-1.60) for all malaria and 0.77 (95% CI 0.38-1.56) for locally acquired malaria.
No serious adverse events occurred.
ConclusionIn a very low-endemic, real-world setting, this trial is the first to evaluate rfMDA using DP.
rfMDA was safe and resulted in lower cumulative incidence compared to RACD, but we were unable to confirm its effectiveness, potentially due to insufficient power.
To assess impact of interventions in very low-endemic settings, multi-site, adaptive trials and use of complementary interventions may be needed.
What is already known?O_LIReactive case detection (RACD), or malaria testing and treatment in the vicinity of passively detected malaria cases, is a standard of care intervention used in low and very low transmission settings aiming for malaria elimination.
C_LIO_LIDespite the use of RACD, progress toward malaria elimination has stalled in many countries and new strategies are needed.
C_LI  What are the new findings?O_LIIn a pragmatic, cluster-randomised controlled trial of rfMDA using dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine compared to RACD, we found that rfMDA was safe.
C_LIO_LIrfMDA resulted in lower cumulative incidence, but we were unable to confirm its effectiveness compared to RACD, potentially due to insufficient power (we expected 63 total clusters would have incident cases, but observed 47).
C_LI  What do the new findings imply?O_LIWhen implemented in a real-world, very low transmission setting, rMDA was safe but evidence regarding its effectiveness to reduce transmission was weak.
C_LIO_LIThe challenge to show a statistically significant impact of a targeted community-based intervention in a very low transmission setting highlights the need for such trials to be multi-site, adaptive, and consider use of complementary interventions.

Identifying hidden Zika hotspots in Pernambuco, Brazil: A Spatial Analysis  Northeast Brazil has the worlds highest rate of Zika-related microcephaly.
Reporting of Zika cases only became mandatory after its association with microcephaly in neonates, when the Zika epidemic was already declining in the region.
To advance the study of the Brazilian Zika epidemic and its impacts, we identified hotspots of Zika in Pernambuco state, Northeast Brazil, using Aedes-borne diseases (dengue, chikungunya and Zika) and microcephaly data.
We used the Kulldorffs Poisson purely spatial scan statistic to detect low- and high-risk clusters and combined the results to identify the municipalities most affected by the Zika epidemic.
Municipalities were classified as hotspots if they were part of any high-risk cluster, and classified according to a gradient of Zika burden during the epidemic, considering the strength of the evidence.
In Pernambuco, officials confirmed 123,934 dengue cases, 167 Zika cases, and 32,983 chikungunya cases between 2014-2017, and 800 microcephaly cases between 2015-2017.
We identified 26 Aedes-borne diseases clusters (11 high-risk), and 5 microcephaly cases clusters (3 high-risk).
Combining the results, sixty-three out of 184 municipalities were identified as hotspots for Zika.
The northeast of Pernambuco and the Sertao region were hit hardest by the Zika epidemic.
The first is the most populous area, while the second has one of the highest rates of social and economic inequality in Brazil.
The identification of Sertao as a Zika hotspot was only possible because the clusters results were combined.
The under-reporting of acute infectious diseases is expected to be higher in poor areas.
Therefore, using only Aedes-borne data does not correctly identify the high-risk areas.
We successfully identified hidden Zika hotspots using a simple methodology combining Aedes-borne diseases and microcephaly information.
Mapping T cell activation and differentiation at single cell resolution in naive hosts infected with Plasmodium vivax  The biology of Plasmodium vivax is markedly different to that of P. falciparum; how this shapes the immune response to infection remains unclear.
To address this shortfall, we inoculated human volunteers with a clonal field isolate of P. vivax and tracked their response through infection and convalescence.
High dimensional protein and RNA-seq data show that P. vivax triggers an acute phase response that shares remarkable overlap with that of P. falciparum, suggesting a hardwired emergency myeloid response that does not discriminate parasite species.

We then used cytometry by time of flight to analyse the fate and function of innate-like and adaptive T cells; these data show that P. vivax can activate up to one quarter of the entire T cell compartment.
Heterogeneous effector memory-like CD4+ T cells dominate this extraordinary response and phenotypic analysis reveals unexpected features of terminal differentiation that are normally associated with cytotoxicity and autoinflammatory disease.
In line with this observation, we found that CD4+ T cell activation coincides with collateral tissue damage and liver injury.
Finally, comparative analyses demonstrate that P. falciparum drives T cell activation far in excess of P. vivax, which may partially explain why falciparum malaria more frequently causes severe disease.

Modelling, Simulations and Analysis ofthe First and Second COVID-19 Epidemics in Beijing  To date, over 130 million people on infected with COVID-19.
It causes more 2.8 millions deaths.
This paper introduces a symptomatic-asymptomatic-recoverer-dead differential equation model (SARDDE).
It gives the conditions of the asymptotical stability on the disease-free equilibrium of SARDDE.
Based on the reported data of the first and the second COVID-19 epidemics in Beijing and simulations, it determines the parameters of SARDDE, respectively.
Numerical simulations of SARDDE describe well the outcomes of current symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, recovered symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, and died individuals, respectively.
The numerical simulations suggest that both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals cause lesser asymptomatic spread than symptomatic spread; blocking rate of about 90% cannot prevent the spread of the COVID19 epidemic in Beijing; the strict prevention and control strategies implemented by Beijing government is not only very effective but also completely necessary.
The numerical simulations suggest also that using the data from the beginning to the day after about two weeks at the turning point can estimate well or approximately the following outcomes of the two COVID-19 academics, respectively.
Systematic review of the entomological impact of insecticide-treated nets evaluated using experimental hut trials in Africa  BackgroundResistance of anopheline mosquitoes to pyrethroid insecticides is spreading rapidly across sub-Saharan Africa, diminishing the efficacy of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) -- the primary tool for preventing malaria.
Experimental hut structures resemble local housing but allow collection of surviving exiting mosquitoes as well as dead or dying mosquitoes.
There is a need to understand how the spread of resistance changes ITN efficacy and to elucidate factors influencing EHT results, including differences in experimental hut construction and design features, to support the development of novel vector control tools.
MethodsA comprehensive database of EHTs was compiled and summarised following a systematic review to identify all known trials investigating ITNs or indoor residual spraying (IRS) across sub-Saharan Africa.
This analysis focuses on EHTs investigating ITNs and uses Bayesian statistical models to characterise the complex interaction between ITNs and mosquitoes, the variability between studies, and the impact of pyrethroid resistance.
ResultsAs resistance rises, the entomological efficacy of ITNs declines.
They induce less mortality and are less likely to deter mosquitoes from entering huts.
Despite this, ITNs continue to offer considerable personal protection by reducing mosquito feeding until resistance reaches high levels.
The relationship between EHT outcomes and the level of resistance (as measured by discriminating dose bioassays) is highly uncertain.
ConclusionsThe meta-analyses show that EHTs are an important reproducible assay for capturing the complex entomological efficacy of ITNs on blood-feeding mosquitoes.
The impact of pyrethroid resistance on these measures appears broadly consistent across a wide geographical area once hut design is accounted for, suggesting results can be extrapolated beyond the sites where the trials were conducted.
Further work is needed to understand factors influencing EHT outcomes and how the relationship between outcomes and resistance varies when different methods are used to assess the level of resistance in wild mosquito populations.
Hepcidin regulation in Kenyan children with severe malaria and non-typhoidal Salmonella bacteremia  BackgroundSevere malaria and invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) are life-threatening infections that often co-exist in African children.
The iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin is highly upregulated during malaria and controls the availability of iron, a critical nutrient for bacterial growth, within the Salmonella-containing vacuole.
MethodsWe first investigated the relationship between Plasmodium falciparum malaria and NTS bacteremia in all pediatric admissions aged [&le;]5 years between August 1998 and October 2019 (n=75,015).
We then assayed hepcidin and measures of iron status in five groups: (1) children with concomitant severe malaria anemia (SMA) and NTS (SMA+NTS, n=16); and in matched children with (2) SMA alone (n=33); (3) NTS alone (n=33); (4) cerebral malaria (CM, n=34); and (5) community-based children.
ResultsIn hospitalized children SMA, but not other malaria phenotypes, was associated with an increased risk of NTS (adjusted OR 2.88 [95% CI 1.97, 4.23]; P<0.0001).
Risk of NTS increased by 30% with each 1g/dl decrease in hemoglobin concentrations.
In hospitalized children median hepcidin levels were lower in the SMA+NTS (9.3 ng/mL [interquartile range 4.7, 49.8]) and SMA (31.1 ng/mL [5.5, 61.2]) groups, compared to levels in those with CM (90.7 ng/mL [38.7, 176.1]) or NTS (105.8 ng/mL [17.3, 233.3]), despite similar ferritin and CRP levels.
Soluble transferrin receptor levels were lower in the CM group compared to the other hospitalized groups.
ConclusionSMA was associated with increased risk of NTS and with reduced hepcidin levels.
We hypothesized that reduced hepcidin might allow increased movement of iron into the Salmonella-containing vacuole favoring bacterial growth.
Optimal use of COVID19 Ag-RDT screening at border crossings to prevent community transmission: a modeling analysis  BackgroundCountries around the world have implemented restrictions on mobility, especially cross-border travel to reduce or prevent SARS-CoV-2 community transmission.
To maximize impact, we developed an optimal Ag-RDT screening algorithm for cross-border entry.
MethodsUsing a previously developed mathematical model, we determined the daily number of imported COVID-19 cases that would generate no more than a relative 1% increase in cases over one month for different effective reproductive numbers (Rt) of the recipient country.
We then developed an algorithm- for differing levels of Rt, arrivals per day, mode of travel, and SARS-CoV-2 prevalence amongst travelers-to determine the minimum proportion of people that would need Ag-RDT testing at border crossings to ensure no greater than the relative 1% community spread increase.
FindingsWhen daily international arrivals and/or COVID-19 prevalence amongst arrivals increases, the proportion of arrivals required to test using Ag-RDT increases.
At very high numbers of international arrivals/COVID-19 prevalence, Ag-RDT testing is not sufficient to prevent increased community spread, especially for lower levels of Rt.
In these cases, Ag-RDT screening would need to be supplemented with other measures to prevent an increase in community transmission.
InterpretationAn efficient Ag-RDT algorithm for SARS-CoV-2 testing depends strongly on Rt, volume of travel, proportion of land and air arrivals, test sensitivity, and COVID-19 prevalence among travelers.

A baseline transcriptional signature associates with clinical malaria risk in RTS,S/AS01-vaccinated African children  In a phase 3 trial in African infants/children, the RTS,S/AS01 (GSK) vaccine showed moderate efficacy against clinical malaria.
We aimed to identify RTS,S/AS01-induced signatures associated with clinical malaria by analyzing antigen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells sampled from a subset of trial participants at baseline and month 3 (one month post-third dose).
RTS,S/AS01 vaccination was associated with downregulation of B-cell and monocyte-related blood transcriptional modules (BTMs) and upregulation of T-cell related BTMs, as well as higher month 3 (vs baseline) circumsporozoite protein (CSP)-specific CD4+ T-cell responses.
There were few RTS,S/AS01-associated BTMs whose month 3 levels correlated with malaria risk.
In contrast, baseline levels of BTMs associated with dendritic cells and with monocytes (among others) correlated with malaria risk.
A cross-study analysis supported generalizability of the baseline dendritic cell- and monocyte-related BTM correlations with malaria risk to healthy, malaria-naive adults, suggesting inflammatory monocytes may inhibit protective RTS,S/AS01-induced responses.
Combining serological assays and official statistics to describe the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic: results from the EPICOVID19-RS study in Rio Grande do Sul (Southern Brazil)  BackgroundThe EPICOVID19-RS study conducted 10 population-based surveys in Rio Grande do Sul (Southern Brazil), starting early in the epidemic.
The sensitivity of the rapid point-of-care test used in the first eight surveys has been shown to decrease over time after some phases of the study were concluded.
The 9th survey used both the rapid test and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test, which has a higher and stable sensitivity.
MethodsWe provide a theoretical justification for a correction procedure of the rapid test estimates, assess its performance in a simulated dataset and apply it to empirical data from the EPICOVID19-RS study.
COVID-19 deaths from official statistics were used as an indicator of the temporal distribution of the epidemic, under the assumption that fatality is constant over time.
Both the indicator and results from the 9th survey were used to calibrate the temporal decay function of the rapid tests sensitivity from a previous validation study, which was used to estimate the true sensitivity in each survey and adjust the rapid test estimates accordingly.
ResultsSimulations corroborated the procedure is valid.
Corrected seroprevalence estimates were substantially larger than uncorrected estimates, which were substantially smaller than respective estimates from confirmed cases and therefore clearly underestimate the true infection prevalence.
ConclusionCorrecting biased estimates requires a combination of data and modelling assumptions.
Progression of COVID19 Pandemic in India: A Concurrent Linear Regression Analysis Approach  This paper uses concurrent linear regression analysis approach to describe the progression of COVID 19 pandemic in India during the period 15 March 2020 through 15 May 2021.
Mendelian randomization analyses show that higher acetyl-carnitine and carnitine levels in blood protect against severe Covid19  BackgroundSevere Covid19 is characterised by a hyperactive immune response.
Carnitine, an essential nutrient, and its derivative acetyl-carnitine can downregulate proinflammatory cytokines and has been suggested as a potential treatment for the disease.
MethodsWe carried out Mendelian randomization analyses using publicly available data from a large genome wide association study (GWAS) of metabolites and a collaborative genome wide study of Covid19 to investigate the nature of the relationship between carnitine and acetyl-carnitine and Covid19 infection, hospitalisation with Covid19 and very severe Covid19.
We used the same methodology to determine whether carnitine was associated with co-morbidities commonly found among those with severe Covid19.
ResultsWe found evidence of a protective effect against very severe Covid19 for both carnitine and acetyl-carnitine, with around a 40% reduction in risk associated with a doubling of carnitine or acetyl-carnitine (carnitine odds ratio (OR) = 0.56, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.33 to 0.95, p=0.03 and acetyl-carnitine OR=0.60, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.02, p=0.06), and evidence of protective effects on hopitalisation with Covid19.
For acetyl-carnitine the largest protective effect was seen in the comparison between those hospitalised with Covid19 and those infected but not hospitalised (OR=0.34, 95%CI 0.18 to 0.62, p=0.0005).
ConclusionCarnitine and acetyl-carnitine merit further investigation in respect to the prevention of severe Covid19.
A systematic review assessing the potential for release of vector species from competition following insecticide-based population suppression of Anopheles species in Africa  BackgroundWhile insecticide-based vector control can effectively target vector species in areas of high malaria endemicity, such as Anopheles gambiae in Africa, residual disease transmission can occur.
Understanding the potential role of competitive displacement between vector species could inform both current insecticide-based vector control programmes and the development of future complementary interventions.
MethodsA systematic review was conducted to identify studies of insecticide-based vector control of Anopheles species in Africa that reported indices for absolute densities of vector species.
After screening against inclusion, exclusion and risk of bias criteria, studies were assigned to three categories based on whether they showed population density changes involving decreases in two or more vector species (D), increases in two or more vector species (I), or increases in one vector species concomitant with decreases in another vector species (ID).
Category ID studies could thus provide evidence consistent with the release of vector species from competition following the insecticide-based population suppression of Anopheles species.
ResultsOf 5,569 papers identified in searches, 30 were selected for quantitative and qualitative analysis.
Nineteen studies were assigned to category D and 1 study to category I.
Ten studies categorised as ID provided evidence ranging from weak to persuasive that release from competition could have contributed to changes in species composition.
Category ID showed no statistical differences from category D for reductions in malaria transmission and levels of insecticide resistance, but did so for insecticide type, pyrethroids being associated with category ID.
A qualitative assessment identified 5 studies that provided the most convincing evidence that release from competition could have contributed to changes in species composition.
ConclusionThis review identified evidence that insecticide-based reductions in the density of Anopheles species in Africa could facilitate the release of other vector species from competition.
These results should inform current and future integrated vector management approaches to malaria control.
Public health relevant consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on malaria in sub-Saharan Africa: A scoping review  BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented challenges to health systems worldwide, including the control of non-COVID-19 diseases.
Malaria cases and deaths may increase due to the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic in malaria endemic countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
ObjectivesThis scoping review aims to summarize information on public health relevant effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the malaria situation in SSA.
MethodsReview of publications and manuscripts on preprint servers, in peer-reviewed journals and in grey literature documents from December 1, 2019, to June 9, 2021.
A structured search was conducted on different databases using predefined eligibility criteria for the selection of articles.
ResultsA total of 51 papers have been included in the analysis.
Modeling papers have predicted a significant increase in malaria cases and malaria deaths in SSA due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Many papers provided potential explanations for expected COVID-19 effects on the malaria burden; these ranged from relevant diagnostical and clinical aspects, to reduced access to health care services, impaired availability of curative and preventive commodities and medications, and effects on malaria prevention campaigns.
Compared to previous years, fewer country reports provided data on the actual number of malaria cases and deaths in 2020, with mixed results.
While highly endemic countries reported evidence of decreased malaria cases in health facilities, low endemic countries reported overall higher numbers of malaria cases and deaths in 2020.
ConclusionsThe findings from this review provide evidence for a significant but diverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on malaria in SSA.
There is the need to further investigate the public health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the malaria burden.
Modelling, Simulations and Analysis of the First COVID-19 Epidemic in Shanghai  To date, over 178 million people on infected with COVID-19.
It causes more 3.8 millions deaths.
Based on a previous symptomatic-asymptomatic-recoverer-dead differential equation model (SARDDE) and the clinic data of the first COVID-19 epidemic in Shanghai, this paper determines the parameters of SARDDE.
Numerical simulations of SARDDE describe well the outcomes of current symptomatic individuals, recovered symptomatic individuals, and died individuals, respectively.
The numerical simulations suggest that both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals cause lesser asymptomatic spread than symptomatic spread; blocking rate of about 95.5% cannot prevent the spread of the COVID19 epidemic in Shanghai.
The numerical simulations suggest also that using the data from the beginning to the day after about 19 days at the turning point can estimate well the following outcomes of the COVID-19 academic.
Determinants of primaquine and carboxyprimaquine exposures in children and adults with Plasmodium vivax malaria  BackgroundPrimaquine is the only widely available drug for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria.
There is uncertainty whether the pharmacokinetic properties of primaquine are altered significantly in childhood or not.
MethodsGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase normal patients with uncomplicated P. vivax malaria were randomized to receive either chloroquine (25mg base/kg) or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (dihydroartemisinin 7mg/kg and piperaquine 55mg/kg) plus primaquine; given either as 0.5 mg base/kg/day for 14 days or 1 mg/kg/day for 7 days.
Pre-dose day 7 venous plasma concentrations of chloroquine, desethylchloroquine, piperaquine, primaquine and carboxyprimaquine were measured.
Methemoglobin levels were measured either daily or on days 1, 3, 6 and 13, and additionally on day 10 in the primaquine 14-day groups.
ResultsDay 7 primaquine and carboxyprimaquine concentrations were available for 641 patients.
After adjustment for the primaquine mg/kg daily dose, day of sampling, partner drug, and fever clearance, there was a significant non-linear relationship between age and trough primaquine and carboxyprimaquine concentrations, and day methemoglobin levels.
Compared to adults 30 years of age, children 5 years of age had trough primaquine concentrations 0.53 (95% CI: 0.39-0.73) fold lower, trough carboxyprimaquine concentrations 0.45 (95% CI: 0.35-0.55) fold lower, and day 7 methemoglobin levels 0.87 (95% CI: 0.58-1.27) fold lower.
Increasing concentrations of piperaquine and chloroquine and poor metabolizer CYP 2D6 alleles were associated with higher day 7 primaquine and carboxyprimaquine concentrations.
Higher blood methemoglobin concentrations were associated with a lower risk of recurrence.
ConclusionYoung children have lower primaquine and carboxyprimaquine exposures, and lower levels of methemoglobinemia, than adults.
Young children may need higher weight adjusted primaquine doses than adults.
Mapping First to Second wave transition of covid19 Indian data via Sigmoid function and prediction of Third wave  Understanding first and second wave of covid19 Indian data along with its few selective states, we have realized a transition between two Sigmoid pattern with twice larger growth parameter and maximum values of cumulative data.
As a result of those transition, time duration of second wave shrink to half of that first wave with four times larger peak values.
After understanding the crossing zone between first and second wave curves, a third wave Sigmoid pattern is guessed.
ANALYSIS OF FOUR DIFFERENT TRANSPORT AND PRESERVATION MEDIUM KITS FOR SARS-COV-2 DIAGNOSIS FROM NASOPHARYNGEAL SWAB BY REAL-TIME PCR: ADAPTING TO THE CONSTANTLY INCREASING DEMAND OF SAMPLING PROCESSING AND STOCK-OUTS DURING THE PANDEMIC  The high demand for supplies during the COVID19-pandemic has generated several stock-out of material and essential reagents needed to meet the current high demand for diagnosis in the worldwide population.
In this way, there is limited information regarding the performance of different virus transport medium (VTM) for nasopharyngeal swab sampling (NPS) aimed for SARS-CoV-2 detection.
We compared the RT-qPCR amplification profile of four different commercial transport medium kits, including DNA/RNA Shield, NAT, VTM, and Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) transport medium, for NPSs samples from Central Metropolitan Health Service, Santiago, Chile.
The RT-qPCR showed a slight lower RNase P Cq value of the samples preserved and transported in DNA/RNA Shield compared to NAT medium.
By contrast, a marked increase in the RNase P Cq value was registered in the samples transported with VTM compared to DNA/RNA Shield medium.
For PBS-preserved NPS, the performance of two strategies were assessed due to the potential presence of any remaining active virus in the sample: (1) thermal inactivation; and (2) thermal inactivation treatment followed by RNA extraction.
The heat inactivation showed a significantly lower Cq value for RNase P and viral ORF1ab Cq compared to the followed by RNA extraction.
This study indicates that new medium alternatives could be used if supplies run out to diagnose COVID19.
Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and mortality suggest endemic infections, in addition to space and population factors, shape dynamics across countries  Some countries have been crippled by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic while others have emerged with few infections and fatalities; the factors underscoring this macro-epidemiological variation is one of the mysteries of this global catastrophe.
Variation in immune responses influence SARS-CoV-2 transmission and mortality, and factors shaping this variation at the country level, in addition to other socio-ecological drivers, may be important.
Here, we construct spatially explicit Bayesian models that combine data on prevalence of endemic diseases and other socio-ecological characteristics to quantify patterns of confirmed deaths and cases across the globe before mass vaccination.
We find that the prevalence of parasitic worms, human immunodeficiency virus and malaria play a surprisingly important role in predicting country-level SARS-CoV-2 patterns.
When combined with factors such as population density, our models predict 63% (56-67) and 76% (69-81) of confirmed cases and deaths among countries, respectively.
While our findings at this macro-scale are necessarily associative, they highlight a need for studies to consider factors, such as infection by other pathogens, on global SARS-CoV-2 dynamics.
These relationships are vital for developing countries that already have the highest burden of endemic disease and are becoming the most affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
Controlled human malaria infection with PvW1: a new clone of Plasmodium vivax with high quality genome assembly  Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) provides a highly informative means to investigate host-pathogen interactions and enable in vivo proof-of-concept efficacy testing of new drugs and vaccines.
However, unlike Plasmodium falciparum, well-characterized P. vivax parasites that are safe and suitable for use in modern CHMI models are limited.
Here, two healthy malaria-naive UK adults with universal donor blood group were safely infected with a clone of P. vivax from Thailand by mosquito-bite CHMI.
Parasitemia developed in both volunteers and, prior to treatment, each volunteer donated blood to produce a cryopreserved stabilate of infected red blood cells.
Following stringent safety screening, the parasite stabilate from one of these donors ("PvW1") was thawed and used to inoculate six healthy malaria-naive UK adults by blood-stage CHMI, at three different dilutions.
Parasitemia developed in all volunteers, who were then successfully drug treated.
PvW1 parasite DNA was isolated and sequenced to produce a high quality genome assembly by using a hybrid assembly method.
We analysed leading vaccine candidate antigens and multigene families, including the Vivax interspersed repeat (VIR) genes of which we identified 1145 in the PvW1 genome.
Our genomic analysis will guide future assessment of candidate vaccines and drugs, as well as experimental medicine studies.
Specialized interferon ligand action in COVID19  The impacts of IFN signaling on COVID19 pathology are multiple, with protective and harmful effects being documented.
We report here a multi-omics investigation of IFN signaling in hospitalized COVID19 patients, defining the biosignatures associated with varying levels of 12 different IFN ligands.
Previously we showed that seroconversion associates with decreased production of select IFN ligands (Galbraith et al, 2021).
We show now that the antiviral transcriptional response in circulating immune cells is strongly associated with a specific subset of ligands, most prominently IFNA2 and IFNG.
In contrast, proteomics signatures indicative of endothelial damage associate with levels of IFNB and IFNA6.
Differential IFN ligand production is linked to distinct constellations of circulating immune cells.
Lastly, IFN ligands associate differentially with activation of the kynurenine pathway, dysregulated fatty acid metabolism, and altered central carbon metabolism.
Altogether, these results reveal specialized IFN ligand action in COVID19, with potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications.
IMPACT STATEMENTAnalysis of multi-omics signatures associated with 12 different IFN ligands reveals their specialized action in COVID19.
Data Visualization for Epidemiological and Demographic Data for Malaria Surveillance in the Brazilian Amazon, 2007-2019  Malaria represents one of the main public health problems worldwide and continues to be a great challenge to Brazil which concentrates about 34.4% of the disease cases registered in the American continent.
Approximately 99% of Malaria cases occur in Amazonia.
In 2017, 194,000 cases were recorded.
The objective of this study is to propose the design of interactive visualizations of data related to Malaria Surveillance in the Brazilian Amazon, between the years of 2007-2019.
We used data visualization techniques to explore epidemiological and demographic aspects of Malaria Surveillance.
Immuno-proteomic profiling reveals abundant airway CD8 T cells and ongoing epithelial injury in prolonged post-COVD19 respiratory disease  Some patients hospitalized with acute COVID19 suffer respiratory symptoms that persist for many months.
To characterize the local and systemic immune responses associated with this form of  Long COVID, we delineated the immune and proteomic landscape in the airway and peripheral blood of normal volunteers and patients from 3 to 6 months after hospital discharge.
The bronchoalveolar lavage (but not peripheral blood) proteome was abnormal in patients with post-COVID19 lung disease with significantly elevated concentration of proteins associated with apoptosis, tissue repair and epithelial injury.
This correlated with an increase in cytotoxic lymphocytes (especially tissue resident CD8+ T cells), lactate dehydrogenase and albumin (biomarkers of cell death and barrier integrity).
Follow-up of a subset of these patients greater than 1-year post-COVID19 indicated these abnormalities resolved over time.
Collectively, these data indicate that COVID-19 results in a prolonged change to the airway immune landscape in those with persistent lung disease, with evidence of cell death and tissue repair linked to ongoing activation of cytotoxic T cells.
HighlightsO_LIThe post-COVID19 airway is characterized by increased cytotoxic lymphocytes.
C_LIO_LIDistinct airway proteomes are associated with the airway immune cell landscape.
C_LIO_LIThe peripheral blood does not predict immune-proteome alterations in the airway post-COVID19.

Adaptive T cells regulate disease tolerance in human malaria  Immunity to severe malaria is acquired quickly, operates independently of pathogen load and represents a highly effective form of disease tolerance.
We developed a human re-challenge model of falciparum malaria in which healthy adult volunteers were infected three times over a 12 month period to track the development of disease tolerance in real-time.
We found that parasitemia triggered a hardwired emergency host response that led to systemic inflammation, pyrexia and hallmark symptoms of clinical malaria across the first three infections of life.
In contrast, a single infection was sufficient to reprogramme T cell activation and reduce the number and diversity of effector cells upon re-challenge.
Crucially, this did not silence stem-like memory cells but instead prevented the generation of cytotoxic effectors associated with autoinflammatory disease.
Tolerised hosts were thus able to prevent collateral tissue damage in the absence of anti-parasite immunity.

HMOX1 genetic polymorphisms and outcomes in infectious disease: a systematic review  IntroductionHeme-oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) is a critical stress response gene that catalyzes the multistep oxidation of heme.
A GT(n) repeat of variable length in the promoter in has been associated with a wide range of human diseases, including infections.
This paper aims to summarise and systematically review associations between the length of the HMOX1 GT(n) promoter and infectious disease in humans.
MethodsA search using relevant terms was performed in PubMED and EMBASE through to 15/01/21 identifying all research that studied an association between the HMOX1 GT(n) repeat polymorphism and the incidence and/or outcome of any human infectious disease.
Results1,533 studies were identified in the search, and one via citation screening.
Sixteen studies were ultimately included, seven in malaria, three in HIV, three in sepsis, and one each in pneumonia, hepatitis C, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Sample sizes for nearly all studies were small (biggest study, n = 1,646).
Allelic definition was different across all included studies.
In malaria, three studies suggested that longer alleles were associated with reduced risk of severe malaria, particularly malaria-induced renal dysfunction, with four studies identifying a null association.
In sepsis, two studies suggested an association with longer alleles and better outcomes.
ConclusionsDespite the importance of HMOX1 in survival from infection, and the association between repeat length and gene expression, the clinical data supporting an association between repeat length and incidence and/or outcome of infection remain inconclusive.
The most promising data supports a potential association with protection from severe malaria, although this was not found in all studies.
The potential impact of Anopheles stephensi establishment on the transmission of Plasmodium falciparum in Ethiopia and prospective control measures  BackgroundSub-Saharan Africa has seen substantial reductions in cases and deaths due to malaria over the past two decades.
While this reduction is primarily due to an increasing expansion of interventions, urbanisation has played its part as urban areas typically experience substantially less malaria transmission than rural areas.
stephensi, the primary urban malaria vector in Asia, was first detected in Africa during 2012 in Djibouti and was subsequently identified in Ethiopia in 2016, and later in Sudan and Somalia.
In Djibouti, malaria cases have increased 30-fold from 2012 to 2019 though the impact in the wider region remains unclear.
MethodsHere we have adapted an existing model of mechanistic malaria transmission to estimate the increase in vector density required to explain the trends in malaria cases seen in Djibouti.
stephensi behaviour, and the unknowns of how it will establish in a novel environment, we sample behavioural parameters in order to account for a wide range of uncertainty.
This quantification is then applied to Ethiopia, considering temperature-dependent extrinsic incubation periods, pre-existing vector-control interventions and Plasmodium falciparum prevalence in order to assess the potential impact of An.
stephensi establishment on P. falciparum transmission.
Following this, we estimate the potential impact of scaling up ITN (insecticide treated nets)/IRS (indoor residual spraying) and implementing piperonyl butoxide (PBO) ITNs and larval source management,, as well as their economic costs.
ResultsWe estimate that annual P. falciparum malaria cases could increase by 50% (95% CI 14-90) if no additional interventions are implemented.
The implementation of sufficient control measures to reduce malaria transmission to pre-stephensi levels will cost hundreds of millions of USD.
ConclusionsSubstantial heterogeneity across the country is predicted and large increases in vector control interventions could be needed to prevent a major public health emergency.
Hybrid immunity versus vaccine-induced immunity against SARS CoV2 in Patients with Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases  IntroductionSingle-dose COVID-19 vaccines in healthy individuals with past COVID-19 infections seem to provide better immunity than double doses in COVID-19 unexposed individuals.
However, it is not known whether the same is true for patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRD) who are on immunosuppressants.
MethodsWe identified 30 patients with AIRD who took a single dose of the ChAdOx1 vaccine post-COVID-19 infection.
Age, sex and disease similar patients were enrolled in to three groups of 30 each who had (1) past infection with COVID-19 but no vaccine, (2) a single dose of ChAdOx1 and (3) double doses of ChAdOx1.
Sera were collected from each patient approximately 30 days after last vaccine dose or since the onset of COVID19 symptoms (in the unvaccinated group).
Antibodies to spike protein were estimated and virus neutralization potential of sera was tested.
ResultsBaseline characteristics including drug usage was similar betweenthe groups.
Seroconversion occurred in 25(83%), 23(77%), 27(90%), and 30(100%) in natural infection, single-dose vaccine, double dose vaccine, and infection +single dose vaccine groups respectively.
Mean antibody titres (10076.8{+/-}8998) in the last group were at least 6-100x higher than in the other 3 groups.
Also, the infection +vaccine group had the highest neutralization potential of 83.37 % as compared to 45.4% in the fully vaccinated group.
ConclusionThe hybrid immunity with a single dose of the vector-based vaccine post-infection seems to be superior to double dosage of the vaccine in patients with AIRD.
A universal vaccination strategy involving a single dose of vaccine for all individuals with previous COVID-19 infection seems to be effective in these patients also.
What is already known about this subject?A single dose of an RNA based COVID-19 vaccine after COVID-19 natural infection provides superior immune protection as compared to double doses of vaccines in infection naive persons  A second dose of vaccine in healthy people who had infection previously does not increase the immune protection but may paradoxically induce tolerance  Vaccine responses in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases(AIRD) may be suboptimal due to underlying disease or the use of immunosuppressants.
What does this study add?Hybrid-induced immunity (single vaccine post COVID-19 infection) produces adequate vaccine responses in patients with AIRD, non-inferior to double dose of vaccine  Besides mRNA vaccines, the adenoviral vector vaccine AZD1222 also demonstrates this hybrid phenomenon.
How might this impact on clinical practice?Vaccination policies can consider providing only a single vaccine in those who had previous COVID-19 infection.
This strategy has been shown not to be harmful for patients with AIRD.
The impact of emerging Plasmodium knowlesi on accurate diagnosis by light microscopy: a systematic review and modelling analysis  The five Plasmodium spp.
that cause human malaria appear similar under light microscopy, which raises the possibility that misdiagnosis could routinely occur in clinical settings.
Assessing the extent of misdiagnosis is of particular importance for monitoring P. knowlesi, which co-circulates with the other Plasmodium spp.
We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing the performance of microscopy and PCR for diagnosing malaria in settings with co-circulation of the five Plasmodium spp.
We assessed the extent to which co-circulation of Plasmodium parasites affects diagnostic outcomes.
We fit a Bayesian hierarchical latent class model to estimate variation in microscopy sensitivity and specificity.
Mean sensitivity of microscopy was low, yet highly variable across Plasmodium spp., ranging from 41.7% (95% CI: 22.8 - 64.1%) for P. falciparum and 40.3% (22.0 - 61.5%) for P. vivax to 0.119% (0.0121 - 0.640%) for P. knowlesi, 7.57% (2.66 - 22.0%) for P. malariae, and 0.180% (0.00491 - 1.21%) for P. ovale.

Serosurvey in two rural areas evidences recent and previously undetected WNV and SLEV circulation in Costa Rica  West Nile virus (WNV) and Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) share similar virus transmission cycles that involve birds as amplifiers and mosquitoes as vectors.
Mammals, including humans, are dead-end-hosts that may be asymptomatic or develop more severe symptoms.
Costa Rica is a hyperendemic country for several flaviviruses such as Dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) and previous research showed limited and restricted SLEV and WNV circulation in horses, sloths, and monkeys.
Nevertheless, actual seroprevalence and high transmission areas are not yet identified.
To determine putative WNV and SLEV circulation, we sampled peri-domestic and domestic animals, humans, wild birds, and mosquitoes in rural households located in two DENV and ZIKV hyperendemic regions during the rainy and dry seasons of 2017-2018 and conducted PRNT assays for serology and RT-PCR for virus detection.
At Cuajiniquil, serological evidence of WNV and SLEV was found in equines, humans, chickens, and wild birds.
Also, 5 seroconversion events were recorded for WNV (2 equine), SLEV (1 human), and DENV-1 (2 humans).
At Talamanca, a lack of WNV circulation was found, but evidence of SLEV circulation was recorded in equines, humans, and wild birds.
No evidence of active viral infection was found in any mosquitoes or wild bird samples.
This seroconversion evidence supports the active and recent circulation of SLEV and WNV in these two regions.
This study provides clear-cut evidence of WNV and SLEV circulation and should be considered by the health and epidemiology authorities for future prevention and differential diagnostics.
Author summaryMosquitoes serve as vectors for the transmission of infectious diseases such as WNV and SLEV.
The natural virus cycle of these viruses is maintained between birds and mosquitoes.
Yet, humans and horses are dead end-hosts and can develop severe diseases such as encephalitis.
We aimed to elucidate if WNV or SLEV were silently circulating in two regions of the country that historically report numerous cases of other arboviruses such as Dengue and Zika.
Eight households were sampled at each region twice during the rainy (high number of arbovirus related infections are reported) and dry season (lower number of infections reported) to record seroconversion events.
Serum samples from different species were analyzed using serology and virus presence was detected through molecular methods for wild bird and mosquito pools samples.
We found serological evidence of WNV and SLEV infection in horses, humans, wild birds, and chicken samples, but did not detect actual virus in any tissue or mosquito sample.
Taken together, our result shows the active but silent circulation of those viruses at both sampling sites.
SARS-CoV-2 infection fatality rates in India: systematic review, meta-analysis and model-based estimation  IntroductionFervorous investigation and dialogue surrounding the true number of SARS-CoV-2 related deaths and implied infection fatality rates in India have been ongoing throughout the pandemic, and especially pronounced during the nations devastating second wave.
We aim to synthesize the existing literature on the true SARS-CoV-2 excess deaths and infection fatality rates (IFR) in India, through a systematic search followed by viable meta-analysis.
We then provide updated epidemiological model-based estimates of the wave 1, wave 2 and combined IFRs using an extension of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model, using data from April 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021.
MethodsFollowing PRISMA guidelines, the databases PubMed, Embase, Global Index Medicus, as well as BioRxiv, MedRxiv, and SSRN for preprints (accessed through iSearch), were searched on July 3, 2021 (with results verified through August 15, 2021).
Altogether using a two-step approach, 4,765 initial citations were screened resulting in 37 citations included in the narrative review and 19 studies with 41 datapoints included in the quantitative synthesis.
Using a random effects model with DerSimonian-Laird estimation, we meta-analyze IFR1 which is defined as the ratio of the total number of observed reported deaths divided by the total number of estimated infections and IFR2 (which accounts for death underreporting in the numerator of IFR1).
For the latter, we provide lower and upper bounds based on the available range of estimates of death undercounting, often arising from an excess death calculation.
The primary focus is to estimate pooled nationwide estimates of IFRs with the secondary goal of estimating pooled regional and state-specific estimates for SARS-CoV-2 related IFRs in India.
In tandem, we present updated SEIR model estimates of IFRs for waves 1, 2, and combined across the waves with observed case and death count data from April 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021.
ResultsFor India countrywide, underreporting factors (URF) for cases (sourced from serosurveys) range from 14.3-29.1 in the four nationwide serosurveys; URFs for deaths (sourced from excess deaths reports) range from 4.4-11.9 with cumulative excess deaths ranging from 1.79-4.9 million (as of June 2021).
Nationwide pooled IFR1 and IFR2 estimates for India are 0.097% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.067 - 0.140) and 0.365% (95% CI: 0.264 - 0.504) to 0.485% (95% CI: 0.344 - 0.685), respectively, again noting that IFR2 changes as excess deaths estimates vary.
Among the included studies in this meta-analysis, the IFR1 generally appear to decrease over time from the earliest study end date to the latest study end date (from 4 June 2020 to 6 July 2021, IFR1 changed from 0.199 to 0.055%), whereas a similar trend is not as readily evident for IFR2 due to the wide variation in excess death estimates (from 4 June 2020 to 6 July 2021, IFR2 ranged from (0.290-1.316) to (0.241-0.651) %).
Nationwide SEIR model-based combined estimates for IFR1 and IFR2 are 0.101% (95% CI: 0.097 - 0.116) and 0.367% (95% CI: 0.358 - 0.383), respectively, which largely reconcile with the empirical findings and concur with the lower end of the excess death estimates.
An advantage of such epidemiological models is the ability to produce daily estimates with updated data with the disadvantages being that these estimates are subject to numerous assumptions, arduousness of validation and not directly using the available excess death data.
Whether one uses empirical data or model-based estimation, it is evident that IFR2 is at least 3.6 times more than IFR1.
ConclusionWhen incorporating case and death underreporting, the meta-analyzed cumulative infection fatality rate in India varies from 0.36%-0.48%, with a case underreporting factor ranging from 25-30 and a death underreporting factor ranging from 4-12.
This implies, by June 30, 2021, India may have seen nearly 900 million infections and 1.7-4.9 million deaths when the reported numbers stood at 30.4 million cases and 412 thousand deaths (covid19india.org) with an observed case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.35%.
We reiterate the need for timely and disaggregated infection and fatality data to examine the burden of the virus by age and other demographics.
Large degrees of nationwide and state-specific death undercounting reinforce the call to improve death reporting within India.
Misdiagnosis prevents accurate monitoring of transmission and burden for sub-critical pathogens: a case study of Plasmodium knowlesi malaria  Maintaining surveillance of emerging infectious diseases presents challenges for monitoring their transmission and burden.
Incomplete observation of infections and imperfect diagnosis reduce the observed sizes of transmission chains relative to their true sizes.
Previous studies have examined the effect of incomplete observation on estimates of pathogen transmission and burden.
However, each study assumed that, if observed, each infection was correctly diagnosed.
Using the zoonotic Plasmodium knowlesi malaria as a case study, I found that, even when assuming complete observation of infections, the number of misdiagnosed cases within a transmission chain for every correctly diagnosed case could range from 0 (0 - 4) when R0 was 0.1 to 86 (0 - 837) when R0 was 0.9.
Data on transmission chain sizes obtained using an imperfect diagnostic could consistently lead to underestimates of R0, the basic reproduction number, and simulations revealed that such data on up to 1,000 observed transmission chains was not powered to detect changes in transmission.
My results demonstrate that misdiagnosis may hinder effective monitoring of emerging infectious diseases and that sensitivity of diagnostics should be considered in evaluations of surveillance systems.
Anopheles salivary antigens as serological biomarkers of vector exposure and malaria transmission: A systematic review with multilevel modelling  BackgroundEntomological surveillance for malaria is inherently resource-intensive and produces crude population-level measures of vector exposure which are insensitive in low-transmission settings.
Antibodies against Anopheles salivary proteins measured at the individual-level may serve as proxy biomarkers for vector exposure and malaria transmission, but their relationship is yet to be quantified.
MethodsA systematic review of studies measuring antibodies against Anopheles salivary antigens (PROSPERO: CRD42020185449).
Multilevel modelling estimated associations between seroprevalence with Anopheles human biting rate (HBR) and malaria transmission measures.
ResultsFrom 3981 studies identified in literature searches, 42 studies across 16 countries were included contributing 393 meta-observations of anti-Anopheles salivary antibodies determined in 42,764 samples.
A positive non-linear association between HBR and seroprevalence was found; overall a 50% increase in HBR was associated with a 13% increase in odds of seropositivity (OR: 1.13, 95%CI: 1.06-1.20, p<0.001).
The association between HBR and Anopheles salivary antibodies was strongest with concordant, rather than discordant Anopheles species.
Seroprevalence was also significantly positively associated with established epidemiological measures of malaria transmission: entomological inoculation rate, Plasmodium spp.
prevalence, and malarial endemicity class.
ConclusionsAnopheles salivary antibody biomarkers can serve as a proxy measure for HBR and malaria transmission, and could monitor vectorial capacity and malaria receptivity of a population to sustain malaria transmission.
Validation of Anopheles species-specific biomarkers are important given the global heterogeneity in the distribution of Anopheles species.
Salivary biomarkers have the potential to transform surveillance by replacing impractical, inaccurate entomological investigations, especially in areas progressing towards malaria elimination.
The impact of climate suitability, urbanisation, and connectivity on the expansion of dengue in 21st century Brazil  Dengue is hyperendemic in Brazil, with outbreaks affecting all regions.
Previous studies identified geographical barriers to dengue transmission in Brazil, beyond which certain areas, such as South Brazil and the Amazon rainforest, were relatively protected from outbreaks.
In this study, we explore the drivers of this expansion and identify the current limits to the dengue transmission zone.
We used a spatio-temporal additive model to explore the associations between dengue outbreaks and temperature suitability, urbanisation, and connectivity to the Brazilian urban network.
The model was applied to a binary outbreak indicator, assuming the official threshold value of 300 cases per 100,000 residents, for Brazils municipalities between 2001 and 2020.
We found a nonlinear relationship between higher levels of connectivity to the Brazilian urban network and the odds of an outbreak, with lower odds in metropoles compared to regional capitals.
The number of months per year with suitable temperature conditions for Aedes mosquitoes was positively associated with the dengue outbreak occurrence.
Municipalities that had experienced an outbreak previously had double the odds of subsequent outbreaks, indicating that dengue tends to become established in areas after introduction.
We identified geographical barriers to dengue transmission in South Brazil, western Amazon, and along the northern coast of Brazil.
Few areas of Brazil remain protected from dengue outbreaks.
Control strategies should target regions at risk of future outbreaks as well as those currently within the dengue transmission zone.
Author summaryDengue is a mosquito-borne disease that has expanded rapidly around the world due to increased urbanisation, global mobility and climate change.
In Brazil, geographical barriers to dengue transmission exist, beyond which certain areas including South Brazil and the Amazon rainforest are relatively protected from outbreaks.
However, we found that the previous barrier in South Brazil has shifted futher south as a result of increased temperature suitability.
The previously identified barrier protecting the western Amazon no longer exists.
This is particularly concerning as we found dengue outbreaks tend to become established in areas after introduction.
Highly influential cities with many transport links had increased odds of an outbreak.
However, the most influencial cities had lower odds of an outbreak than cities connected regionally.
This study highlights the importance of monitoring the expansion of dengue outbreaks and designing disease prevention strategies for areas at risk of future outbreaks as well as areas in the established dengue transmission zone.
Investigation of Dengue Fever Outbreak in a Rural Area of Islamabad, Pakistan: A Case Control Study  BackgroundIn the second week of October 2019, five suspected cases of dengue fever were reported from union council Sohan, Islamabad rural (population 45,747) to the health department, Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT).
MethodsOutbreak investigation was conducted from 17th October to 25th November 2019.
A case was defined as, "fever and two or more of the following signs/symptoms; headache, retro-orbital pain, joint/bone pain, myalgia and petechial rash with NS1 test (Nonstructural Protein 1) positive during 8th October to 25th November 2019 among residents of Sohan".
Age and sex-matched controls were recruited from the same neighborhood.
All cases were positive for NS1 antigen.
Blood samples from five suspected cases were collected and tested for laboratory confirmation.
ResultsA total of 547 households were surveyed and 85 cases were identified.
The mean age was 34.4 years + 16.05 (range 3-71 years).
The attack rate was 0.19% whereas the most affected age group was the 45-54 years (AR 0.43%).
Males were predominantly affected (n=48 56.5%).
Among all cases, 32% (n=27)) had stagnant water inside or around their houses (aOR 2.65, CI 1.20-5.83, P=0.005), 33% (n=28) were using mosquito repellent (aOR 0.35, CI 0.17-0.70, P<0.001), 31% (n=26) used indoor residual spray insecticide (aOR 0.48, CI 0.24-0.97, P=0.041), and 73% (n=62) used full protective clothing (aOR 0.17, CI 0.05-0.58, P<0.001).
All five blood samples were tested positive for NS-1 antigen.
ConclusionThe presence of accumulated rainwater in pools and empty receptacles around houses acted as breeding grounds for Aedes aegypti mosquitos and was the most probable cause of this outbreak.
Following our recommendations, the health department-initiated mosquito breeding sites control activities through residual insecticide spray and advocacy on the use of protective measures against mosquito bites.
Level and determinants of willingness to pay for rapid COVID-19 testing delivered through private retail pharmacies in Kenya.
IntroductionTo support the government response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, accessible and sustainable testing approaches are needed.
Private retail pharmacies are a key channel through which communities can access COVID-19 testing.
We examined the level and determinants of the willingness to pay (WTP) for rapid COVID-19 testing delivered through private retail pharmacies in Kenya.
MethodsData was collected following a cross-sectional double-bounded dichotomous choice contingent valuation survey across 341 clients visiting five private retail pharmacies in Nairobi, Kisumu and Siaya counties.
ResultsOur findings indicate mean and median WTP levels of KES 611 (US$ 5.59) and KES 506 (US$ 4.63), respectively.
Estimated WTP varied across counties and increased with household income and self-reported interest in pharmacy-based COVID-19 rapid testing.

I derive the formulae for vaccine efficacy that correct for this phenomenon and show that such biases explain some of the differences between higher estimates of vaccine efficacy observed in the US studies, on one hand, and lower estimates from Israel and Pfizer trials, on the other hand.
Control for such biases is important for currently-debated public health decisions regarding COVID19 vaccine booster doses.
Autoimmune conditions following mRNA (BNT162b2) and inactivated (CoronaVac) COVID-19 vaccination: a descriptive cohort study among 1.1 million vaccinated people in Hong Kong  BackgroundConcerns regarding the autoimmune safety of COVID-19 vaccines may negatively impact vaccine uptake.
We aimed to describe the incidence of autoimmune conditions following BNT162b2 and CoronaVac vaccination and compare these with age-standardized incidence rates in non-vaccinated individuals.
MethodsThis is a descriptive cohort study conducted in public healthcare service settings.
Territory-wide longitudinal electronic medical records of Hong Kong Hospital Authority users ([&ge;]16 years) were linked with COVID-19 vaccination records between February 23, 2021 and June 30, 2021.
We classified participants into first/second dose BNT162b2 groups, first/second dose CoronaVac groups and non-vaccinated individuals for incidence comparison.
The study outcomes include hospitalized autoimmune diseases (16 types of immune-mediated diseases across six body systems) within 28 days after first and second dose of vaccination.
Age-standardized incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Poisson distribution.
ResultsThis study included around 3.9 million Hong Kong residents, of which 1,122,793 received at least one dose of vaccine (BNT162b2: 579,998; CoronaVac: 542,795), and 721,588 completed two doses (BNT162b2: 388,881; CoronaVac: 332,707).
Within 28 days following vaccination, cumulative incidences for all autoimmune conditions were below 9 per 100,000 persons, for both vaccines and both doses.
None of the age-standardized incidence rates were significantly higher than the non-vaccinated individuals, except for an observed increased incidence of hypersomnia following the first dose of BNT162b2 (standardized IRR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.10-1.94).
ConclusionsAutoimmune conditions requiring hospital care are rare following mRNA and inactivated virus COVID-19 vaccination with similar incidence to non-vaccinated individuals.
The association between first dose BNT162b2 vaccination and immune-related sleeping disorders requires further research.
Population-based robust safety surveillance is essential to detect rare and unexpected vaccine safety events.

Estimating dengue transmission intensity from serological data: a comparative analysis using mixture and catalytic models.
BackgroundDengue virus (DENV) infection is a global health concern of increasing magnitude.
To target intervention strategies, accurate estimates of the force of infection (FOI) are necessary.
Catalytic models have been widely used to estimate DENV FOI and rely on a binary classification of serostatus as seropositive or seronegative, according to pre-defined antibody thresholds.
Previous work has demonstrated the use of thresholds can cause serostatus misclassification and biased estimates.
In contrast, mixture models do not rely on thresholds and use the full distribution of antibody titres.
To date, there has been limited application of mixture models to estimate DENV FOI.
MethodsWe compare the application of mixture models and time-constant and time-varying catalytic models to simulated data and to serological data collected in Vietnam from 2004 to 2009 (N [&ge;] 2178) and Indonesia in 2014 (N = 3194).
ResultsThe simulation study showed greater estimate bias from the time-constant and time-varying catalytic models (FOI bias = 1.3% (0.05%, 4.6%) and 2.3% (0.06%, 7.8%), seroprevalence bias = 3.1% (0.25%, 9.4%) and 2.9% (0.26%, 8.7%), respectively) than from the mixture model (FOI bias = 0.41% (95% CI 0.02%, 2.7%), seroprevalence bias = 0.11% (0.01%, 3.6%)).
When applied to real data from Vietnam, the mixture model frequently produced higher FOI and seroprevalence estimates than the catalytic models.
ConclusionsOur results suggest mixture models represent valid, potentially less biased, alternatives to catalytic models, which could be particularly useful when estimating FOI and seroprevalence in low transmission settings, where serostatus misclassification tends to be higher.
Author summaryCharacterising the transmission intensity of dengue virus in different geographic areas over time is essential to understand who is at greatest risk of infection, and to inform the implementation of interventions, such as vector control and vaccination.
We compared the application of catalytic and mixture models to calculate the force of infection (FOI) of dengue virus from antibody titre data.
We observed greater bias in FOI estimates obtained from catalytic models than from mixture models in areas where the transmission intensity was low.
In high transmission intensity areas, catalytic and mixture models produced consistent estimates.
Our results indicate that in low transmission settings, when antibody titre data are available, mixture models could be preferential to estimate dengue virus FOI.
Improving the diagnosis of severe malaria in African children using platelet counts and plasma PfHRP2 concentrations  BackgroundSevere falciparum malaria is difficult to diagnose accurately in children in high transmission settings.
Platelet counts and plasma concentrations of P. falciparum histidinerich protein-2 (Pf HRP2) are potential biomarkers to increase diagnostic accuracy.
MethodsWe fitted Bayesian latent class models to platelet counts and Pf HRP2 concentrations in 2,649 patients enrolled in four studies of severe illness in three countries (Bangladesh, Kenya, and Uganda).
We estimated receiver operating characteristic curves and compared parasite densities, haematocrits, total white blood cell counts, blood culture positivity rates, and haemoglobin S genotypes (HbAS and HbSS) across the subgroups defined by the probabilistic models.
FindingsThe platelet count and the plasma Pf HRP2 concentration have substantial diagnostic value in severe malaria.
In severely ill patients with clinical features consistent with severe malaria, a combined platelet count [&le;] 150,000 per {micro}L and a plasma Pf HRP2 concentration [&ge;] 1,000 ng/mL had an estimated sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 93% in identifying  true severe falciparum malaria.
We estimate one third of African children enrolled in the two clinical studies of severe malaria had another cause of severe illness.
Under the model, patients with severe malaria had higher parasite densities, lower haematocrits, lower rates of invasive bacterial disease, and a lower prevalence of both HbAS and HbSS than children misdiagnosed.
Mortality in  true severe malaria was consistent across the African sites at [~] 10%.
InterpretationStudies of severe falciparum malaria in African children would be improved by including only patients with platelet counts [&le;] 150,000 per {micro}L and plasma Pf HRP2 concentrations [&ge;] 1,000 ng/mL.

Ignoring transmission dynamics leads to underestimation of the impact of a novel intervention against mosquito-borne disease  New vector-control technologies to fight mosquito-borne diseases are urgently needed, the adoption of which depends on efficacy estimates from large-scale cluster-randomized trials (CRTs).
The release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes is one promising strategy to curb dengue virus (DENV) transmission, and a recent CRT reported impressive reductions in dengue incidence following the release of these mosquitoes.
Such trials can be affected by multiple sources of bias, however.
We used mathematical models of DENV transmission during a CRT of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to explore three such biases: human movement, mosquito movement, and coupled transmission dynamics between trial arms.
Taken together, our findings suggest that Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes could be even more promising than the recent CRT suggested.
Childhood mortality during and after acute illness in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia - The CHAIN cohort study  ObjectivesMortality during acute illness among children in low- and middle-income settings remain unacceptably high and there is increasing recognition of the importance of post-discharge mortality.
A comprehensive understanding of pathways underlying mortality among acutely ill children is needed to develop interventions and improve guidelines.
We aimed to determine the incidence, timing and contributions of proximal and underlying exposures for mortality among acutely ill young children from admission to hospital until 6 months after discharge in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia in the context of guideline-based care.
DesignA prospective stratified cohort study recruiting acutely ill children at admission to hospital with follow up until 180 days after discharge from hospital (November 2016-July 2019).
SettingNine urban and rural hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia across a range of facility levels, and local prevalences of HIV and malaria.
ParticipantsInclusion criteria were age 2-23 months, admission to hospital with acute, non-traumatic medical illness and stratified into three groups by anthropometry.
Children were excluded if currently receiving pulmonary resuscitation, had a known condition requiring surgery within 6 months or known terminal illness with death expected within 6 months.
Main outcome measuresAcute mortality occurring within 30-days from admission; post-discharge mortality within 180-days from discharge; characteristics with direct and indirect associations with mortality within a multi-level a priori framework including demographic, clinical, anthropometric characteristics at admission and discharge from hospital, and pre-existing child-, caregiver- and household-level characteristics.
ResultsOf 3101 participants (median age 11 months), 1218 were severely wasted/kwashiorkor, 763 moderately wasted and 1120 were not wasted.
Of 350 deaths, 182 (52%) occurred during index admission, 234 (67%) within 30-days of admission and 168 (48%) within 180-days post-discharge.
Ninety (54%) post-discharge deaths occurred at home.
The ratio of inpatient to post-discharge mortality was consistent across anthropometric strata and sites.
Large high and low risk groups could be disaggregated for both early and post-discharge mortality.
Structural equation models identified direct pathways to mortality and multiple socioeconomic, clinical and nutritional domains acting indirectly through anthropometric status.
ConclusionsAmong diverse sites in Africa and South Asia, almost half of mortality occurs post-discharge.
A fundamental shift to a risk-based approach to inpatient and post-discharge management is needed to further reduce childhood mortality and clinical trials of these approaches with outcomes of mortality, readmission and cost are warranted.

Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the malaria burden in northern Ghana: Analysis of routine surveillance data  IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic and its collateral damage severely impact health systems globally and risk to worsen the malaria situation in endemic countries.
Malaria is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Ghana.
This study aims to analyze routine surveillance data to assess possible effects on the malaria burden in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Northern Region of Ghana.
MethodsMonthly routine data from the District Health Information Management System II (DHIMS2) of the Northern Region of Ghana were analyzed.
Overall outpatient department visits and malaria incidence rates from the years 2015 to 2019 were compared to the corresponding data of the year 2020.
ResultsCompared to the corresponding periods of the years 2015 to 2019, overall visits and malaria incidence in pediatric and adult outpatient departments in northern Ghana decreased in March and April 2020, when major movement and social restrictions were implemented in response to the pandemic.
Incidence slightly rebounded afterwards in 2020 but stayed below the average of the previous years.
Data from inpatient departments showed a similar but more pronounced trend when compared to outpatient departments.
In pregnant women, however, malaria incidence in outpatient departments increased after the first COVID-19 wave.
DiscussionThe findings from this study show that the COVID-19 pandemic affects the malaria burden in health facilities of Ghana, with declines in in- and outpatient rates.
Pregnant women may experience reduced access to intermittent preventive malaria treatment and insecticide treated nets, resulting in subsequent higher malaria morbidity.
Further data from other African countries, particularly on community-based studies, are needed to fully determine the impact of the pandemic on the malaria situation.
The prognostic and diagnostic value of intraleukocytic malaria pigment: an individual patient data pooled meta-analysis of 32,000 patients with severe falciparum malaria in Africa and Asia  Severe falciparum malaria is a major cause of death in tropical countries, particularly in African children.
In 6,027 prospectively studied patients diagnosed with severe malaria we assessed the prognostic value of peripheral blood film counts of malaria pigment containing polymorphonu-clear leukocytes (PMNs) and monocytes.
We combined these results with previously published data and show, in an individual patient data meta-analysis (n=32,035), that the proportion of pigment containing PMNs is predictive of in-hospital mortality.
In African children the proportion of pigment containing PMNs is a strong indicator that the primary diagnosis is severe malaria, and it adds to the prognostic assessment from simple bedside examination, and to the conventional malaria parasite count.
Microscopy assessment of pigment containing PMNs is simple and rapid, and should be performed in all patients hospitalised with suspected severe malaria.
Residual insecticide surface treatment for preventing malaria: a systematic review protocol  IntroductionMalaria presents a significant global public health burden, although substantial progress has been made, with vector control initiatives such as indoor residual surface spraying with insecticides and insecticide treated nets.
There now exists many different approaches to apply residual insecticide to indoor and outdoor surfaces in malaria endemic settings.
This review aims to synthesise the best available evidence regarding full or partial indoor or outdoor residual insecticide surface treatment for preventing malaria.
Methods and AnalysisThis review will comprehensively search the literature (both published and unpublished) for any studies investigating the effectiveness of residual insecticide surface treatment for malaria.
Studies will be screened to meet the inclusion criteria by a minimum of two authors, followed by assessment of risk of bias (using appropriate risk of bias tools for randomised and non-randomised studies) and extraction of relevant information using structured forms by two independent authors.
Meta-analysis will be carried out where possible for epidemiological outcomes such as malaria, anaemia, malaria related mortality, all-cause mortality and adverse effects.
Ethics and DisseminationA full review report will be submitted to the Vector Control & Insecticide Resistance Unit, Global Malaria Program, WHO.
The report will inform the development of WHO recommendations regarding residual insecticide treatment for malaria.

Epidemiology study of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in India, the first and second wave  Background and objectivesSARS-CoV-2 has wrecked the world for the past 17 months.
India has been hit by the second wave of the virus which has been characterized by new symptoms.
This study focuses on the pattern of infection over the last 13 months utilizing epidemic model to predict course of the pandemic.
Material and methodsThe data was collected from covid19india.org to perform analysis based on age and gender distribution.
Statistical analysis was performed to determine the relation between confirmed and recovered cases while SIR epidemic model was used to determine the course of the pandemic in the country and the changes that have occurred from the first to the second wave.
Results and discussionsResults show infectivity rate to be higher in ages 20-50 while mortality is higher in 50-80 age group while 60-70% of the infected population are males.
Each of the 9 states have their own salient feature curves of infection.
It was seen that the confirmed and recovered cases are more correlated at present than previous wave.
The curves for both waves show a polynomial distribution while the reproduction number data shows an almost U-shaped curve indicating decrease of infection spread in the middle phase when the first wave was on a decline before picking up again owing to the second wave.
Interpretations and conclusionThe gender and age distribution shows that although lower age group is more infected, mortality is high for higher age groups, on the other hand males are more prone to the infection.
The statistical analysis shows the nature of spread of the disease, the data of which is quantified by the SIR model based study.
Seroprevalence of anti-SARS coronavirus 2 antibodies in Thai adults during the first three epidemic waves  This study sought to determine the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody status of 4111 Thai people from May 2020 to April 2021, a period which spanned the first two and part of the third epidemic wave of the COVID-19 in Thailand.
Participants comprised 142 COVID-19 patients, 2113 individuals at risk due to their occupations [health personnel, airport officers, public transport drivers, and workers in entertainment venues (pubs, bars and massage parlors)], 1856 individuals at risk due to sharing workplaces or living communities with COVID-19 patients, and 553 Thai citizens returning after extended periods in countries with a high disease prevalence.
All sera were tested in a microneutralization assay and a chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) for IgG against the N protein.
Furthermore, we performed an immunofluorescence assay to resolve discordant results between the two assays.
Antibody responses developed in 88% (15 of 17) of COVID-19 patients at 8 days and in 94-100% between 15 and 60 days after disease onset.
Neutralizing antibodies persisted for at least 8 months, longer than the IgG did, against the N protein.
None of the health providers, airport officers, and public transport drivers were seropositive, while the antibodies were present in 0.44% of entertainment workers.
This study showed the seropositivity of 1.9, 1.5, and 7.5% during the 3 epidemic waves, respectively, in Bangkok residents who were at risk due to sharing workplaces or communities with COVID-19 patients.
Also, antibody prevalence was 1.3% in Chiang Mai people during the first epidemic wave, and varied between 6.5 and 47.0% in Thais returning from high-risk countries.
This serosurveillance study found a low infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in Thailand before the emergence of the Delta variant in late May 2021.
The findings support the Ministry of Public Healths data, which are based on numbers of patients and contact tracing.
Evidence on the role of journal editors in the COVID19 infodemic: metascientific study analyzing COVID19 publication rates and patterns  ObjectiveInfodemic, a neologism characterizing an excess of fast-tracked low quality publications, has been employed to depict the scientific research response to the COVID19 crisis.
This study aimed to test the COVID19 infodemic claim by assessing publication rates and patterns of COVID19-related research and a control, a year prior.
The publication growth rates of preprint and MEDLINE-indexed peer-reviewed literature on COVID19 were compared using the correspondent Influenza output, a year prior, as control.
Rp for COVID19 and Influenza papers and preprints were generated and compared and then analyzed in light of the respective growth patterns of their papers and preprints.
Main outcomesOutput growth rates and Reproduction Number of Publications (Rp).
ResultsCOVID19 peer-reviewed papers showed a fourteen fold increase compared to Influenza papers.
COVID19 papers and preprints displayed an exponential growth curve until the 20th week.
COVID19 papers displayed Rp=3.17{+/-}0.72, while the control group presented Rp=0.97{+/-}0.12.
Their preprints exhibited Rp=2.18{+/-}0.54 and Rp=0.97{+/-}0.27 respectively, with no evidence of exponential growth in the control group, as its Rp remained approximately one.
ConclusionsCOVID19 publications displayed an epidemic pattern.
As the growth patterns of COVID19 peer-reviewed articles and preprints were similar, and the majority of the COVID19 output came from indexed journals, not only authors but also editors appear to had played a significant part on the infodemic.
Review protocolhttps://osf.io/q3zkw/?view_only=ff540dc4630b4c6e9a2639d732047324  Ethical aspectsNo ethical clarence was required as all analyzed data were publicly available.
Much has been commented on 2020s excess of publications on COVID19.
Independent studies found evidence of increased volume and speed of publication, decreased methodological quality, and qualitative variations in peer review of COVID19 papers, when compared to the scholarly output from before the pandemic.
This phenomenon has been branded an infodemic, a neologism implying an epidemic of low-quality information on COVID19 when high quality scientific reports to inform health policies would have been needed the most.
No study pushed the infodemic metaphor forward to analyze not only volume of publication but also publication rates comparing them to a control group as to clearly pinpoint an exponential phase of contagion in the infodemic (as it would take place in a real epidemic) through a mathematical analysis of the growth patterns and rates of those publications.
In this paper, we were able to demonstrate that there has been an infodemic indeed and that the editor population was as susceptible to the infodemic bug as the author population because the exponential phase was shaped not only by authors but mainly by editors from PubMed-indexed journals.

Projected health impact of post-discharge malaria chemoprevention among children with severe malarial anaemia in Africa  Children recovering from severe malarial anaemia (SMA) remain at high risk of readmission and death after discharge from hospital.
However, a recent trial found that post-discharge malaria chemoprevention (PDMC) reduces this risk.
We developed a mathematical model describing the daily incidence of uncomplicated and severe malaria requiring readmission among 0-5 year-old children after hospitalised SMA.
We fitted the model to a multicentre clinical PDMC trial using Bayesian methods.
We then modelled the potential impact of PDMC across malaria-endemic African countries.
In the 19 highest-burden countries, we estimate that only 2-5 children need to be given PDMC to prevent one hospitalised malaria episode, and less than 100 to prevent one death.
If all hospitalised SMA cases access PDMC, 37,000 (range 16,000-84,000) malaria-associated readmissions could be prevented annually, depending on access to hospital care.
We estimate that recurrent SMA post-discharge constitutes 18-29% of all SMA episodes in higher transmission settings.

Comparative study of immunogenicity and safety of Gam-COVID-Vac and Sinopharm BBIBP-CorV vaccines in Belarus  IntroductionLack of comparative studies on efficiency of a broad range of COVID19 vaccines leads to lower levels of adoption and subsequent lower total immunity in several regions, including Republic of Belarus.
This clinical study captures and transparently demonstrates varying immunogenic responses to Sputnik V and Sinopharm vaccines.
Aim of this study wasto compare the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of Sputnik V (Gam-COVID-Vac), RF and Sinopharm (BBIBP-CorV), PRC vaccines in vaccinated individuals.
Materials and MethodsA total of 60 adults participated the study.
The immune response after vaccination was assessed using enzyme immunoassay.
IgG levels measured in all participants at three time points: before the vaccination, 42 days after the first vaccine dose, and 6 months after the first vaccine dose.
The results of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody test is quantified according to the WHO First International Standard (NIBSC code:20/136) and expressed in international units (BAU/ml).
ResultsThe study participants were divided into two groups, where 30 people (50%) were vaccinated with Sputnik V (Gam-COVID-Vac), and 30 people were vaccinated with Sinopharm (BBIBP-CorV), with no gender differences in the groups.
The IgG levels at 42 days after the first vaccine dose were: Sputnik V (Gam-COVID-Vac)(42 days): Me=650.4 (642.2-669.4); Sinopharm (BBIBP-CorV)(42 days): Me=376.5 (290.9-526.4); p<0,001).
The IgG levels at 6 months after the first vaccine dose were: Sputnik V (Gam-COVID-Vac)(6 months) Me=608.7 (574.6-647.1); Sinopharm (BBIBP-CorV)(6 months): Me=106.3 (78.21-332.4); p<0,001).
Reactions after vaccination appeared in 27 vaccinated individuals (45%).
ConclusionThe study showed that Sputnik V (Gam-COVID-Vac) vaccine was more immunogenic than Sinopharm (BBIBP-CorV) vaccine.
IgG levels in vaccinated individuals who previously recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection ("hybrid immunity") were higher than in SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals.
Reactions after vaccines administration were mild to moderate.
The influence of biological, epidemiological, and treatment factors on the establishment and spread of drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum  The effectiveness of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to treat Plasmodium falciparum malaria is threatened by resistance.
We developed a disease modelling approach with emulator-based global sensitivity analysis to systematically quantify which of these factors drive establishment and spread of drug resistance.
Drug resistance was more likely to evolve in low transmission settings due to the lower levels of (i) immunity and (ii) within-host competition between genotypes.
Spread of parasites resistant to artemisinin partner drugs depended on the period of low drug concentration (known as the selection window).
Spread of partial artemisinin resistance was slowed with prolonged parasite exposure to artemisinin derivatives and accelerated when the parasite was also resistant to the partner drug.
Thus, to slow the spread of partial artemisinin resistance, molecular surveillance should be supported to detect resistance to partner drugs and to change ACTs accordingly.
Furthermore, implementing more sustainable artemisinin-based therapies will require extending parasite exposure to artemisinin derivatives, and mitigating the selection windows of partner drugs, which could be achieved by including an additional long-acting drug.
Impact StatementDetailed models of malaria and treatment dynamics were combined with emulator-based global sensitivity analysis to elucidate how the interplay of drug properties, infection biology, and epidemiological dynamics drives evolution of resistance to artemisinin-based combination therapies.
The impact of malaria-protective red blood cell polymorphisms on parasite biomass in children with severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria  Severe falciparum malaria is a major cause of preventable child mortality in sub-Saharan Africa.
The sequestration of parasitized erythrocytes in the microvasculature of vital organs is a central pathophysiological feature.
The plasma concentration of the parasite protein P. falciparum Histidine-Rich Protein 2 (PfHRP2) has diagnostic and prognostic value in severe malaria.
In the current study we investigate the potential use of plasma PfHRP2 and the sequestration index (the ratio of plasma PfHRP2 to circulating parasites) as quantitative traits in the conduct of case-only genetic association studies of severe malaria.
We demonstrate the utility of this approach using data from over 2,000 Kenyan children with severe malaria, genotyped for 14 major candidate genes that were found to be associated with protection against severe malaria in previous studies.
We show that PfHRP2 is a more informative quantitative trait than peripheral parasite density, and that polymorphisms in four major red cell genes (the {beta}S sickle mutation in HBB, the blood group mutation O in ABO, the -thalassaemia mutation in HBA, and the Dantu blood group mutation in GYP) are associated with substantially lower concentrations of plasma PfHRP2 at admission.
Further, the effect sizes we observed were considerably larger than those relating to peripheral parasite density.
An unexpected outlier was the rs1541255 A>G polymorphism in ATP2B4 for which we saw higher plasma PfHRP2 concentrations, lower parasite densities and a higher sequestration index.
BIRC6 modifies risk of invasive bacterial infection in Kenyan children  Invasive bacterial disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in African children.
Despite being caused by diverse pathogens, children with sepsis are clinically indistinguishable from one another.
In spite of this, most genetic susceptibility loci for invasive infection that have been discovered to date are pathogen specific and are not therefore suggestive of a shared genetic architecture of bacterial sepsis.
Here we utilise probabilistic diagnostic models to identify children with a high probability of invasive bacterial disease among critically unwell Kenyan children with P. falciparum parasitaemia.
We construct a joint dataset including 1,445 bacteraemia cases and 1,143 severe malaria cases, and population controls, among critically unwell Kenyan children that have previously been genotyped for human genetic variation.
Using these data we perform a cross-trait genome-wide association study of invasive bacterial infection, weighting cases according to their probability of bacterial disease.
In doing so we identify and validate a novel risk locus for invasive infection secondary to multiple bacterial pathogens, that has no apparent effect on malaria risk.
The locus identified modifies splicing of BIRC6 in stimulated monocytes, implicating regulation of apoptosis and autophagy in the pathogenesis of sepsis in Kenyan children.
Estimating the burden of malaria and soil-transmitted helminth co-infection in sub-Saharan Africa: a geospatial study  BackgroundLimited understanding exists about the interactions between malaria and soil-transmitted helminths (STH), their potential geographical overlap and the factors driving it.
This study characterised the geographical and co-clustered distribution patterns of malaria and STH infections among vulnerable populations in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
Methodology/Principal findingsWe obtained continuous estimates of malaria prevalence from the Malaria Atlas Project and STH prevalence surveys from the WHO-driven Expanded Special Project for the Elimination of NTDs (ESPEN) covering 2000-2018 and used spatial autocorrelation methods to identify statistically significant clusters for both diseases across SSA.
We used the inverse distance weighted kriging (interpolation) methods to estimate STH prevalence.
We calculated the population-weighted prevalence of malaria and STH co-infection, and used the bivariate local indicator of spatial association (LISA analysis) to explore potential co-clustering of both diseases at the implementation unit levels.
Our analysis shows spatial variations in the estimates of the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum-STH co-infections and identified hotspots across many countries in SSA with inter-and intra-country variations.
High P. falciparum and high hookworm co-infections were more prevalent in West and Central Africa, whereas high P. falciparum, high Ascaris lumbricoides, high P. falciparum, and high Trichuris trichiura co-infections were more predominant in Central Africa, compared to other sub-regions in SSA.
High P. falciparum and high hookworm co-infections were more prevalent in West and Central Africa, whereas high P. falciparum, high Ascaris lumbricoides, high P. falciparum, and high Trichuris trichiura co-infections were more predominant in Central Africa, compared to other sub-regions in SSA.
High P. falciparum and high hookworm co-infections were more prevalent in West and Central Africa, whereas high P. falciparum, high Ascaris lumbricoides, high P. falciparum, and high Trichuris trichiura co-infections were more predominant in Central Africa, compared to other sub-regions in SSA.
High P. falciparum and high hookworm co-infections were more prevalent in West and Central Africa, whereas high P. falciparum, high Ascaris lumbricoides, high P. falciparum, and high Trichuris trichiura co-infections were more predominant in Central Africa, compared to other sub-regions in SSA.
Conclusions/SignificanceWide spatial heterogeneity exists in the prevalence of malaria and STH co-infection within the regions and within countries in SSA.
The geographical overlap and spatial co-existence of malaria and STH could be exploited to achieve effective control and elimination agendas through the integration of the vertical programmes designed for malaria and STH into a more comprehensive and sustainable community-based paradigm.
Author SummaryMalaria and worms frequently co-exist together among children living in the poorest countries of the world, but little is known about the specific locations of the combined infections involving the two major parasitic diseases and how they interact and change over the years.
We used open access data collected by two public registries, that is, the Malaria Atlas Project and Expanded Special Project for the Elimination of NTDs, to understand the overlap of the two diseases in different parts of Africa, where their burden are more predominant.
For example, double infections with malaria and hookworm were more common in West and Central Africa, whereas malaria and roundworm, and malaria and whipworm were predominantly found in Central Africa.
A large collection of the dual infections was also found in some localities within the countries which appeared to have low burden of the two diseases.
The results of this study could also be used to develop and implement integrated control programmes for malaria and worms, and this could help to achieve the WHO NTD roadmap to ending the neglect to attain Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.
Socioeconomic, demographic and environmental factors inform intervention prioritization in urban Nigeria  Nigeria is one of three countries projected to have the largest absolute increase in the size of its urban population and this could intensify malaria transmission in cities.
Accelerated urban population growth is out-pacing the availability of affordable housing and basic services and resulting in living conditions that foster vector breeding and heterogeneous malaria transmission.
Understanding community determinants of malaria transmission in urban areas informs the targeting of interventions to populations at greatest risk.
In this study, we analyzed cluster-level data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and the Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) as well as geospatial covariates to describe malaria burden and its determinants in areas administratively defined as urban in Nigeria.
Overall, we found low malaria test positivity across urban areas.
We observed declines in test positivity rate over time and identified the percentage of individuals with post-primary education, the percentage of individuals in the rich wealth quintiles, the percentage of individuals living in improved housing in 2015, all age population density, median age, the percentage of children under the age of five that sought medical treatment for fever, total precipitation and enhanced vegetation index as key community predictors of malaria transmission intensity.
The unrepresentativeness of the DHS and MIS in urban settings at the state and geopolitical zonal level, regional differences in malaria seasonality across Nigeria, and information detection bias were among likely factors that limited our ability to compare malaria burden across geographic space and ultimately drove model uncertainty.
Nevertheless, study findings provide a starting point for informing decisions on intervention prioritization within urban spaces and underscore the need for improved regionally-focused surveillance systems in Nigeria.
Spatio-temporal clusters and patterns of spread of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in Colombia  BackgroundColombia has one of the highest burdens of arboviruses in South America.
The country was in a state of hyperendemicity between 2014 and 2016, with co-circulation of several Aedes-borne viruses, including a syndemic of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in 2015.
Methodology/Principal FindingsWe analyzed the cases of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika notified in Colombia from January 2014 to December 2018 by municipality and week.
The trajectory and velocity of spread was studied using trend surface analysis, and spatio-temporal high-risk clusters for each disease in separate and for the three diseases simultaneously (multivariate) were identified using Kulldorffs scan statistics.
During the study period, there were 66,628, 77,345 and 74,793 cases of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, respectively, in Colombia.
The spread patterns for chikungunya and Zika were similar, although Zikas spread was accelerated.
Both chikungunya and Zika mainly spread from the regions on the Atlantic coast and the south-west to the rest of the country.
We identified 21, 16, and 13 spatio-temporal clusters of dengue, chikungunya and Zika, respectively, and, from the multivariate analysis, 20 spatio-temporal clusters, among which 7 were simultaneous for the three diseases.
For all disease-specific analyses and the multivariate analysis, the most-likely cluster was identified in the south-western region of Colombia, including the Valle del Cauca department.
Conclusions/SignificanceThe results further our understanding of emerging Aedes-borne diseases trajectory in Colombia and provide useful information on the identified spatio-temporal disease-specific and multivariate clusters of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, that can be used to target interventions.
To our knowledge, this is the first time that the co-occurrence of all three diseases in Colombia was explored using multivariate scan statistics.
The contribution of malaria and sickle cell disease to anaemia among children aged 6 to 59 months in Nigeria: A secondary analysis using data from the 2018 Demographic and Health Survey  IntroductionAnaemia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among children in sub-Saharan Africa.
Anaemia has many aetiologies best addressed by different treatments, so regional studies of the aetiology of anaemia may be required.
MethodsWe analysed data from Nigerias 2018 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) to study predictors of anaemia among children ages 6-59m.
We computed the fraction of anaemia at different degrees of severity attributable to malaria and sickle cell disease (SCD) using a regression model adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic risk factors.
ResultsWe found that 63.7% (95% CI: 58.3-69.4) of semi-severe anaemia (<80 g/L) was attributable to malaria compared to 12.4% (95% CI: 11.1-13.7) of mild-to-severe (adjusted haemoglobin concentration <110 g/L) and 29.6% (95% CI: 29.6-31.8) of moderate-to-severe (<100 g/L) anaemia and that SCD contributed 0.6% (95%CI: 0.4-0.9), 1.3% (95% CI: 1.0-1.7), and 7.3% (95%CI: 5.3-9.4) mild-to-severe, moderate-to-severe, and semi-severe anaemia, respectively.
Sickle trait was protective against anaemia and was associated with higher haemoglobin concentration compared to children with normal haemoglobin (HbAA) among malaria-positive but not malaria-negative children.
ConclusionThis approach used offers a new tool to estimate the contribution of malaria to anaemia in many settings using widely available DHS data.
The fraction of anaemia among young children in Nigeria attributable to malaria and SCD is higher at more severe levels of anaemia.
Prevention of malaria and SCD and timely treatment of affected individuals would reduce cases of severe anaemia.
Epidemiological and virological factors determining dengue transmission in Sri Lanka during the COVID-19 pandemic  BackgroundWith the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 there was a drastic reduction in the number of dengue cases in Sri Lanka, with an increase towards the end of 2021.
We sought to study the contribution of virological factors, human mobility, school closure and mosquito factors in affecting these changes in dengue transmission in Sri Lanka during this time.
Methods and findingsTo understand the reasons for the differences in the dengue case numbers in 2020 to 2021 compared to previous years, we determined the association between the case numbers in Colombo (which has continuously reported the highest number of cases) with school closures, stringency index, changes in dengue virus (DENV) serotypes and vector densities.
There was a 79.4% drop in dengue cases from 2019 to 2020 in Colombo.
A significant negative correlation was seen with the number of cases and school closures (Spearmans r=-0.4732, p=<0.0001) and a negative correlation, which was not significant, between the stringency index and case numbers (Spearmans r= -0.3755 p=0.0587).
There was no change in the circulating DENV serotypes with DENV2 remaining the most prevalent serotype by early 2022 (65%), similar to the frequencies observed by end of 2019.
The Aedes aegypti premise and container indices showed positive but insignificant correlations with dengue case numbers (Spearman r= 0.8827, p=0.93).
ConclusionsLockdown measures, especially school closures seemed to have had a significant impact on the number of dengue cases, while the vector indices had a limited effect.
The impact of reactive case detection on malaria transmission in Zanzibar in the presence of human mobility  Malaria persists at low levels on Zanzibar despite the use of vector control and case management.
We use a metapopulation model to investigate the role of human mobility in malaria persistence on Zanzibar, and the impact of reactive case detection.
The model was parameterized using survey data on malaria prevalence, reactive case detection, and travel history.
We find that in the absence of imported cases from mainland Tanzania, malaria would likely cease to persist on Zanzibar.
While we find that some additional cases are removed by reactive case detection, a large proportion of cases are missed due to many infections having a low parasite density that go undetected by rapid diagnostic tests, a low rate of those infected with malaria seeking treatment, and a low rate of follow up at the household level of malaria cases detected at health facilities.
While improvements in reactive case detection would lead to a reduction in malaria prevalence, none of the intervention scenarios tested here were sufficient to reach elimination.

Acceptability and associated factors of indoor residual spraying for Malaria control by households in Luangwa district of Zambia: A multilevel analysis  BackgroundThe global burden of malaria has increased from 227 million cases in 2019 to 247 million cases in 2020.
Indoor residual spraying (IRS) remains one of the most effective control strategies for malaria.
MethodsA cross sectional study was conducted from October to November 2020 in sixteen urban and rural communities of Luangwa district using a cluster sampling method, Multilevel analysis was used to account for the hierarchical structure of the data.
ResultsThe acceptability level of indoor residual spraying among household heads was relatively high at 87%.
Individuals who felt the timing was not appropriate were associated with decreased odds of accepting IRS (AOR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.20 - 0.86).
Positive attitude was associated with increased odds of accepting IRS (AOR = 29.34, 95% CI: 11.14 - 77.30).
High acceptability level was associated with unemployment (AOR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.07 - 3.44).
ConclusionAcceptability level of indoor residual spraying was relatively high among households of Luangwa District suggesting that the interventions are more acceptable which is essential in reaching malaria elimination by 2030.
Finding that community factors known to influence acceptability such as information, education and communication as well as awareness were not important to influencing acceptability suggests need for reinforcing messages related to indoor residual spraying and redefining the community sensitization approaches to make indoor residual spraying more acceptable.
Epidemiological topology data analysis links severe COVID-19 to RAAS andhyperlipidemia associated metabolic syndrome conditions  The emergence of COVID19 created incredible worldwide challenges but offers unique opportunities to understand the physiology of its risk factors and their interactions with complex disease conditions, such as metabolic syndrome.
Epidemiological analysis powered by topological data analysis (TDA) is a novel approach to uncover these clinically relevant interactions.
Here TDA utilized Explorys data to discover associations among severe COVID19 and metabolic syndrome, and it explored the probative value of drug prescriptions to capture the involvement of RAAS and hypertension with COVID19 as well as modification of risk factor impact by hyperlipidemia on severe COVID19.
A mixed cross-sectional and case-control study approach to investigate the risk-factors of Noma/Cancrum oris in Ethiopia  IntroductionNoma is a polymicrobial gangrenous facial disease affecting people living in the most impoverished areas of low- and middle-income countries.
If left untreated, the disease is fatal or else severely disfigure people with the condition.
The compromised immune system, poor oral hygiene, measle infection, diarrheal disease, inaccessibility to health education and proper medical care, and lack of a balanced diet and good sanitary facilities are found to be some of the predisposing factors for the development and progression of the disease.
Furthermore, debilitating diseases like malaria and measles were considered as significant precursors to Noma.
Materials and MethodA mix of cross-sectional and case-control study approaches was conducted to assess the risk factors of Noma in Ethiopia.
Three controls were selected per single case.
The Odd ratio (ORs) and Chi-square test were calculated to rule out the statistical significance of the association observed between the factors and the disease.
ResultsA total of 64 cases were selected for the case-control study.
Considering the 1:3 case to control ratio, 192 matching controls were identified.
Malaria, helminths, measle, diarrheal diseases, and living with domestic animals were found to be risk factors for Noma with a respective p-value < 0.01.
Contrarily, the analysis has identified vaccination (p < 0.01) as a protective factor.
DiscussionNoma/face of poverty is mostly preventable by providing proper nutrition, sanitary and water facilities, awareness about the disease, oral health education, and vaccinations.
Poverty-related diseases such as malaria, helminths infection, measle, diarrheal diseases, and unfavorable living conditions were identified to be the risk factor for Noma.
Prevention of the disease can be achieved through promoting overall awareness of the disease, poverty reduction, improved nutrition, and promotion of exclusive breastfeeding in the first 3-6 months of life.
Furthermore, optimum prenatal care, timely immunizations against common childhood diseases, initiating vaccination, and improving the social living conditions are the other preventive mechanisms.
Reconstructing long-term dengue virus immunity in French Polynesia  BackgroundUnderstanding the underlying risk of infection by dengue virus from surveillance systems is complicated due to the complex nature of the disease.
In particular, the probability of becoming severely sick is driven by serotype-specific infection histories as well as age; however, this has rarely been quantified.
Island communities that have periodic outbreaks dominated by single serotypes provide an opportunity to disentangle the competing role of serotype, age and changes in surveillance systems in characterising disease risk.
MethodologyWe develop mathematical models to analyse 35 years of dengue surveillance (1979-2014) and seroprevalence studies from French Polynesia.
We estimate the annual force of infection, serotype-specific reporting probabilities and changes in surveillance capabilities using the annual age and serotype-specific distribution of dengue.
Principal FindingsEight dengue epidemics occurred between 1979 and 2014, with reporting probabilities for DENV-1 primary infections increasing from 3% to 5%.
The reporting probability for DENV-1 secondary infections was 3.6 times that for primary infections.
Reporting probabilities for DENV-2-DENV-4 were 0.1-2.6 and 0.7-2.3 times that for DENV-1, for primary and secondary infections, respectively.
Reporting probabilities declined with age after 14 y.o.
Between 1979 and 2014, the proportion never infected declined from 70% to 23% while the proportion infected at least twice increased from 4.5% to 45%.
By 2014, almost half of the population had acquired heterotypic immunity.
The probability of an epidemic increased sharply with the estimated fraction of susceptibles among children.
Conclusion / SignificanceBy analysing 35 years of dengue data in French Polynesia, we characterised key factors affecting the dissemination profile and reporting of dengue cases in an epidemiological context simplified by mono-serotypic circulation.
Our analysis provides key estimates that can inform the study of dengue in more complex settings where the co-circulation of multiple serotypes can greatly complicate inference.
Author summaryCharacterising the true extent of dengue circulation and the level of population immunity is essential to assess the burden of disease, evaluate epidemic risk and organise prevention strategies against future epidemics.
However, this is difficult in a context where most people who are infected by dengue virus (DENV) only have mild symptoms which may not be reported to surveillance systems.
In this article, we develop a mathematical model to evaluate the fraction of unreported dengue infections from case data.
These factors are known to contribute to variations in the severity of symptoms and hence the reporting probabilities, but have rarely been taken into account in model frameworks to study population immunity from the case data.
Using the developed model, we study long-term dengue virus immunity in French Polynesia.
Prevalence and correlates of urogenital schistosomiasis in school going children in Maramba compound of Livingstone District, Zambia  BackgroundSchistosomiasis is an acute and chronic parasitic disease that is caused by trematode worms (blood flukes) of the genus Schistosoma.
Schistosoma haematobium (S. haematobium) is known to cause urogenital schistosomiasis.
The disease is the second most common socio-economically devastating tropical parasitic disease after malaria in Africa.
In Zambia, it affects over a million school going children, mostly in rural communities due to unsafe water and inadequate sanitation facilities.
This study aimed to determine the presence of S. haematobium in urine specimens of school going children in Maramba compound of Livingstone and establish factors associated with the acquisition and spread of the parasite.
MethodsA structured questionnaire was administered on all children with signed consent from their guardians/parents and afterward spot urine specimens were collected in sterile containers for macroscopically/microscopically examination by an independent laboratory technologist.
ResultsA total of 173 school going children participated in the study.
Parasitic eggs were detected in 6 specimens providing a prevalence of 3.47% (p<0.01) and this had a strong association with presence of microscopic red blood cells (p<0.01), dysuria (p=0.026), washing in a stream (p=0.01), and the perception on bilharzia acquisition (p<0.01).
ConclusionThe prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis among school going children in Maramba compound was 3.47%, and the correlates of the infection included washing in a stream, older age and poor knowledge on schistosomiasis.
Participants that had schistosomiasis often presented with hematuria and lacked knowledge on disease acquisition, health effects and preventive measures.
This calls for more robust sensitization of school going children and periodic screening to curb the disease.
qPCR in a suitcase for rapid Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax surveillance in Ethiopia  Many Plasmodium spp.
infections, both in clinical and asymptomatic patients, are below the limit of detection of light microscopy or rapid diagnostic test (RDT).
Molecular diagnosis by qPCR can be valuable for surveillance, but is often hampered by absence of laboratory capacity in endemic countries.
To overcome this limitation, we optimized and tested a mobile qPCR laboratory for molecular diagnosis in Ziway, Ethiopia, where transmission intensity is low.
Protocols were optimized to achieve high throughput and minimize costs and weight for easy transport.
899 samples from febrile patients and 1021 samples from asymptomatic individuals were screened by local microscopy, RDT, and qPCR within a period of six weeks.
34/52 clinical Plasmodium falciparum infections were missed by microscopy and RDT.
Only 4 asymptomatic infections were detected.
No hrp2 deletions were observed among 25 samples typed, but 19/24 samples carried hrp3 deletions.
The majority (25/41) of Plasmodium vivax infections (1371 samples screened) were found among asymptomatic individuals.
All asymptomatic P. vivax infections were negative by microscopy and RDT.
In conclusion, the mobile laboratory described here can identify hidden parasite reservoirs within a short period of time, and thus inform malaria control activities.
Protective efficacy of holed and aging PBO-pyrethroid synergist-treated nets on malaria infection prevalence in north-western Tanzania  Two billion pyrethroid long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) have been distributed since 2010 for malaria prevention in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Current malaria control strategies rely on an assumed effective 3-year lifespan for LLINs.
PBO synergist LLINs are a newly recommended class but there is limited information on their life span and long-term protective efficacy in communities.
To assess their operational survival, a cohort of 390 PBO LLINs (Olyset Plus) and 367 standard pyrethroid LLIN (Olyset net) from 396 households were followed for 36 months in Western Tanzania.
To assess the association between the condition of the LLIN and malaria infection, nets from at least 480 randomly selected households were assessed during malaria prevalence cross-sectional surveys at 4, 9, 16, 21, 28, and 33 months post-distribution.
After 3 years less than 17% of nets distributed were available for sleeping.
The fabric condition was not associated with malaria infection in either type of net.
The difference between the net types was highest when nets were between 1-2 years old, when PBO nets appeared to be similarly protective as nets less than a year old, whereas standard nets were considerably less protective as they aged, regardless of fabric condition.
There was no statistical difference in the estimated median functional survival time between net types with 1.6 years (95% CI 1.38-1.87) for PBO LLIN and 1.9 years (95% CI 1.67-2.06) for standard LLINs.
After 3 years, there was a loss of 55% of permethrin content for both nets, and 97% of PBO content was lost in PBO LLIN.
These results highlight that functional survival is less than the recommended 3 years for both net types.
Malaria and typhoid fever coinfection among patients presenting with febrile illnesses in Ga West Municipality, Ghana  BackgroundMalaria and typhoid fever coinfection presents major public health problems especially in the tropics and sub-tropics where malaria and typhoid fever are co-endemic.
Clinicians often treat both infections concurrently without laboratory confirmation.
However, concurrent treatment has public health implications as irrational use of antibiotics or anti-malarials may lead to the emergence of drug resistance, unnecessary cost and exposure of patients to unnecessary side effects.
This study determined the proportion of febrile conditions attributable to either malaria and/or typhoid fever and the susceptibility patterns of Salmonella spp.
isolates to commonly used antimicrobial agents in Ghana.
MethodsOne hundred and fifty-seven (157) febrile patients attending the Ga West Municipal Hospital, Ghana, from February to May 2017 were sampled.
Blood samples were collected for cultivation of pathogenic bacteria and the susceptibility of the Salmonella isolates to antimicrobial agents was performed using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method with antibiotic discs on Muller Hinton agar plates.
For each sample, conventional Widal tests for the detection of Salmonella spp were done as well as blood film preparation for detection of Plasmodium spp.
Data on the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the study participants were collected using an android technology software kobo-collect by interview.
Data were analyzed using Stata version 13 statistical Software.
Logistic regression models were run to determine odds ratio (OR) and the direction of association between dependent and independent variables, setting p-value at <0.05 for statistical significance.
ResultsOf the total number of patients aged 2-37 years (median age = 6 years, IQR 3-11), 82 (52.2%) were females.
The proportion of febrile patients with falciparum malaria were 57/157 (36.3%), while Salmonella typhi O and H antigens were detected in 23/157 (14.6%) of the samples.
The detection rate of Salmonella spp in febrile patients was 10/157 (6.4%).
Malaria and typhoid fever coinfection using Widal test and blood culture was 9 (5.7%) and 3 (1.9%), respectively.
The isolates were highly susceptible to cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and amikacin but resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, co-trimoxazole, gentamicin, cefuroxime, chloramphenicol, and meropenem.
ConclusionPlasmodium falciparum and Salmonella spp coinfections were only up to 1.9%, while malaria and typhoid fever, individually, were responsible for 36.3% and 6.4%, respectively.
Treatment of febrile conditions must be based on laboratory findings in order not to expose patients to unnecessary side effects of antibiotics and reduce the emergence and spread of drug resistance against antibiotics.
Characteristics of Patients with Hematologic Malignancies Without Seroconversion Post-COVID19 Third Vaccine Dosing  Patients with hematologic malignancies (HM) are at greater risk of severe morbidity and mortality caused by COVID19 and show a lower response to a two-dose COVID19 mRNA vaccine series.
The primary objective of this retrospective cohort study is to explore the characteristics of the subset of patients with HM who had little to no change in SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody titer levels after a 3rd vaccine dose (3V) (-/-).
As a secondary objective, we seek to compare the cohorts of patients who did and did not seroconvert post-3V to get a better understanding of the demographics and potential drivers of serostatus.
A total of 625 patients with HM had two titer results at least 21 days apart pre- and post- the 3V dose.
Among the participants who were seronegative prior to 3V (268), 149 (55.6%) seroconverted after the 3V dose and 119 (44.4%) did not.
HM diagnosis was significantly associated with seroconversion status (P = .0003) with patients non-Hodgkin lymphoma 6 times the odds of not seroconverting compared to multiple myeloma patients (P = .0010).
Among the cohort of patients who remained seronegative post-3V, 107 (90.0%) patients showed no reaction to 3V as indicated by pre- and post- 3V index values.
This study focuses on an important subset of patients with HM who are not seroconverting after the COVID mRNA 3V, providing much needed data for clinicians to target and counsel this subset of patients.
Clinical and haematological profile of dengue among adult patients at a tertiary care hospital in Pokhara  IntroductionDengue is an important infectious disease.
This disease is prevalent in the terai belts of Nepal mainly.
But in the last few years, the cases are in increasing trend in the hilly areas of Nepal also.
Hence this study was done in an aim to study the clinical and haematological profile of the dengue cases.
MethodsThis was a retrospective cross-sectional quantitative study done at a tertiary teaching hospital of Pokhara, Nepal after obtaining ethical approval from the institutional ethical committee.
The data of serologically confirmed dengue cases, during the period of August 2019 to December 2019, of age above 15 years, were collected and analysed using SPSS 20.
Descriptive analysis in terms of mean, median, percentage as well as t-test for nominal and chi-square tests were used to compare different parameters.
P-value[&le;] 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
ResultsOut of 922 patients, approximately one-half (50.5%) cases were seen during the month of September.
Median age of presentation was 29 years with slightly more cases of males (52.4%).
Three hundred and forty seven patients were admitted.
Fever (96.5%) and headache (40.6%) were the most common symptoms on presentation of admitted cases.
Leukopenia (55.3%) was more common than thrombocytopenia (47.6%) in the admitted cases.
On comparison between admitted patients with warning signs and those without signs, no significant variation was seen in terms of age, total leukocyte count and total platelet count.
ConclusionDengue is common in young population.
Fever, headache and gastrointestinal symptoms are common among dengue patients.
Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are common laboratory features of dengue.
An epidemiological and intervention assessment of the malaria epidemic in Bolivar, Venezuela: a modelling study  BackgroundVenezuela has experienced an explosive resurgence in Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria incidence over the last decade due to various social, political, and economic factors.
To ensure national and regional progress towards malaria elimination, there is an urgent need to better understand the epidemiological dynamics of this malaria outbreak at its epicenter in the southern state of Bolivar and to identify the sets of interventions that may be necessary to reduce transmission and incidence.
MethodsWe fitted transmission models of P. falciparum and P. vivax to weekly incidence data in Bolivar, Venezuela during 2000-2018.
MethodsWe fitted transmission models of P. falciparum and P. vivax to weekly incidence data in Bolivar, Venezuela during 2000-2018.
MethodsWe fitted transmission models of P. falciparum and P. vivax to weekly incidence data in Bolivar, Venezuela during 2000-2018.
We estimated the magnitude of local transmission for both Plasmodium spp.
and inferred the contribution of relapses and reinfections to P. vivax incidence in the region.
Compared to a business-as-usual scenario, we projected the impact of different interventions on Plasmodium spp.
FindingsWe estimated that 63{middle dot}7 - 73{middle dot}3% of all P. vivax infections in Bolivar are relapses, leading to as many as 51,800 observed relapses misclassified per year as reinfections in the routine surveillance data.
Our estimates suggest that the reproduction number remains close to one for both Plasmodium spp., pointing towards the feasibility of control.
Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) were projected to cause greater proportional reductions in P. falciparum incidence than P. vivax incidence, and mass drug administration (MDA) with an 8-aminoquinoline and a blood-stage partner drug was projected to cause the greatest reduction in P. vivax incidence, provided that adherence rates were high.

InterpretationControl of the malaria outbreak in Southeastern Venezuela is feasible, should appropriate resources to support surveillance and control be brought to bear.
Coupling the distribution of LLINs and a focal MDA with an 8-aminoquinoline and a blood-stage partner drug may lead to the greatest reduction in malaria incidence.
FundingNational Science Foundation; University of Notre Dame; National Institute of General Medical Sciences (grant number 1R35GM143029-01 to TAP);  RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before the studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed, bioRxiv, and medRxiv for articles in English published on or before May 25th, 2021 using the following keywords: "Venezuela", "malaria", AND "model*".
Previous studies have applied statistical models to characterize the relationship between malaria incidence and climate in Venezuela, concluding that the reproduction number is low and suggesting the feasibility of control.
A study fitting a mechanistic transmission model to epidemiological data to allow for projecting the impact of alternative approaches to control has not been performed.
Added value of the studyWe fitted Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax transmission models to 20 years of weekly incidence data to estimate the transmission of both Plasmodium spp.
and characterize the contribution of relapses and reinfections to P. vivax incidence in Bolivar, Venezuela.
Implications of the available evidenceThe burden of Plasmodium vivax relapses in Bolivar is underestimated from routine surveillance data, so control interventions must target the hypnozoite reservoir in the region.
Mass drug administration (MDA) is projected to be impactful for both Plasmodium spp., though tradeoffs between coverage and adherence suggest that a focal MDA with an 8-aminoquinoline and a blood-stage partner drug may yield the greatest impact.
Assessing the effectiveness of malaria interventions at the regional level in Ghana using a mathematical modelling Application  BackgroundSupporting malaria control with interfaced applications of mathematical models that enables investigating effectiveness of various interventions as well as their cost implications could be supportive.
Through their usage for planning, these applications may improve the chances of attaining various set targets such as those of the National Strategic Plan policy for malaria control 2014-2020 in Ghana.
This approach could boost the fight against malaria and accelerate the achievement of pre-elimination in a shorter time  MethodsA single patch malaria model was adapted and used for simulating the incidence of malaria in all ten administrative regions of Ghana.
The model and its application were developed by the Modelling and Simulation Hub Africa (MASHA) and calibrated using aggregated district level data captured on the District Health Information Management System (DHIMS) in Ghana from 2012 to 2018.
Average monthly rainfall at the zonal level was fitted to trigonometric functions for each zone using least squares approach.
These zonal functions were then used as forcing functions for all the regions within their respective zones.
Various intervention packages such as increasing insecticide treated bednets coverage and usage, increasing indoor residual spraying coverage and effectiveness, improving the health system effectiveness, increasing seasonal malaria chemotherapy coverage among children were investigated to observe the their impact on averting malaria incidence by 2030.
ResultsIncreased usage of bednets but not only coverage levels, predicted to lead to significant proportion of cases of malaria averted in all regions.
Whereas, improvements in the health systems by way of health seeking, testing and treatment predicted to lead to a decline in incidence largely in all regions, it allows more incidence cases to be detected in the Upper East, Upper West and Brong-Ahafo regions.
Indoor residual spraying could also benefit populations of the Transitional forest and Coastal savannah as its impact is significant in averting incidence.
ConclusionsHaving achieved relatively high bednet coverage, enhancing bednet usage to at least a doubling of the current usage levels and deployed in combination with various interventions in all the regions predicted a significant reductions, ranging from 44.0% - 97.0%, in malaria incidence.
Regions of the Transitional forest and Coastal savannah could also benefit from a drastic decline in incidence following a gradual introduction of indoor residual spraying on a sustained basis.
A much improved health system in all regions could potentially cater for all incident cases that were not prevented through vector control activities.
The modelling application has shown to be beneficial given the opportunity to be able to study in relatively more detail, the regional differences in malaria morbidity in Ghana.

Reporting of critical laboratory results in a tertiary hospital in Kenya  Prompt communication of critical laboratory results is important for patient safety.
We tracked 12 types of laboratory tests over a three-week period in December 2018 and documented if and how critical test results were communicated, the time-frame for communication, and evidence of action taken on the results.
During the period, 331 of 5,500 (6.1%) test results were identified as critical.
Only 71 (21%) of the critical results were documented as having been communicated to the destination departments.
Of the communicated results, clinicians were unaware of 21 (29.6%).
Of the 12 test types, critical results were only communicated for three tests namely: potassium, haemoglobin and positive malaria tests.
Communication of critical results to inpatient settings was significantly higher than to outpatient settings (p <0.05), with communication rates decreasing as the week progressed, during weekends and around holidays.
The observed poor communication of critical results in an LMIC setting raise significant patient safety concerns.
Training of staff, establishment of standard operating procedures guiding these results, and implementation of fail-proof critical result dissemination mechanisms are essential.
It is important that all critical results are communicated within one hour of availability.
Implementation of Order Entry and Laboratory systems should be highly considered.
Delayed booster dosing improves human antigen-specific Ig and B cell responses to the RH5.1/AS01B malaria vaccine  BackgroundAntibodies are crucial for vaccine-mediated protection against many pathogens.
We have previously shown that a delayed fractional (DFx) dosing schedule (0-1-6mo) - using AS01B-adjuvanted RH5.1 malaria antigen - substantially improves serum IgG durability as compared to monthly dosing (0-1-2mo; NCT02927145).
However, the underlying mechanism and whether there are wider immunological changes with DFx dosing was unclear.
MethodsImmunokinetics of PfRH5-specific Ig across multiple isotypes were compared between DFx and monthly regimen vaccinees.
Peak responses were characterised in-depth with a systems serology platform including biophysical and functional profiling.
Computational modelling was used to define the humoral feature set associated with DFx dosing.
PfRH5-specific B cells were quantified by flow cytometry and sorted for single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).
Differential gene expression between DFx and monthly dosing regimens was explored with Seurat, DESeq2 and gene set enrichment analysis.
ResultsDFx dosing increases the frequency of circulating PfRH5-specific B cells and longevity of PfRH5-specific IgG1, as well as other isotypes and subclasses.
At the peak antibody response, DFx dosing was distinguished by a systems serology feature set comprising increased FcRn-binding, IgG avidity, and proportion of G2B and G2S2F IgG Fc glycans, alongside decreased IgG3, antibody-dependent complement deposition, and proportion of G1S1F IgG Fc glycan.
At the same time point, scRNA-seq of PfRH5-specific B cells revealed enriched plasma cell and Ig / protein export signals in the monthly dosing group as compared to DFx vaccinees.
ConclusionsDFx dosing of the RH5.1/AS01B vaccine had a profound impact on the humoral response.
Our data suggest plausible mechanisms relating to improved FcRn-binding (known to improve Ig longevity) and a potential shift from short-lived to long-lived plasma cells.
Recent reports of the positive impact of delayed boosting on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine immunogenicity highlight the broad relevance of these data.
High sensitivity of a novel rapid test for the diagnosis of clinical and subclinical Plasmodium falciparum infections in a high transmission setting in Burundi  Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are a key tool for the diagnosis of malaria infections among febrile and subclinical individuals.
Low-density infections, and deletions of the P. falciparum hrp2/3 genes (encoding for the HRP2 and HRP3 proteins detected by many RDTs) present challenges for RDT-based diagnosis.
The novel Rapigen Biocredit three-band Plasmodium falciparum HRP2/LDH RDT was evaluated among 444 febrile and 468 subclinical individuals in a high transmission setting in Burundi.
Results were compared to the AccessBio CareStart HRP2 RDT, and qPCR with a sensitivity of <0.1 parasites/{micro}L blood.
Sensitivity among clinical patients was 80.0% (250/313, either of HRP2/LDH positive), compared to 73.2% (229/313) for CareStart (P=0.048).
Among subclinical infections, sensitivity was 72.3% (162/224) compared to 58.5% (131/224) for CareStart (P=0.003), and reached 88.3% (53/60) in children <15 years.
No (0/362) hrp2 and 2/366 hrp3 deletions were observed.
In conclusion, the novel RDT showed improved sensitivity for the diagnosis of P. falciparum.
Interactions between seasonal temperature variation and temporal synchrony drive increased arbovirus co-infection incidence  Though instances of arthropod-borne (arbo)virus co-infection have been documented clinically, the overall incidence of arbovirus co-infection and its drivers are not well understood.
Now that dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses are all in circulation across tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, it is important to understand the environmental and biological conditions that make co-infections more likely to occur.
To understand this, we developed a mathematical model of cocirculation of two arboviruses, with transmission parameters approximating dengue, Zika, and/or chikungunya viruses and co-infection possible in both humans and mosquitoes.
We examined the influence of seasonal timing of arbovirus cocirculation on the extent of co-infection.
By undertaking a sensitivity analysis of this model, we examined how biological factors interact with seasonality to determine arbovirus co-infection transmission and prevalence.
We found that temporal synchrony of the co-infecting viruses and average temperature were the most influential drivers of co-infection incidence.
For seasonal patterns typical of a tropical region, we observed non-negligible incidence irrespective of arrival time when two arboviruses arrived simultaneously.
Under our default parameter settings, this corresponded to a maximum co-infection cumulative incidence of 83 per 1,000 individuals and a minimum cumulative incidence of 32 per 1,000 individuals in the year following arrival.
For seasonal patterns typical of a more temperate region, co-infections only occurred if arrivals took place near the seasonal peak, and even then, did not reach 0.01 co-infections per 1,000 individuals.
Our model highlights the synergistic effect of co-transmission from mosquitoes, which leads to more than double the number of co-infections than would be expected in a scenario without co-transmission.
Our results show that arbovirus co-infections are unlikely to occur in appreciable numbers unless epidemics overlap in space and time and in a tropical region.
Aggressive Antipyretics in CNS Malaria: Study Protocol of a Randomized-Controlled Trial Assessing Antipyretic Efficacy and Parasite Clearance Effects (Malaria FEVER Study)  BackgroundDespite ongoing eradication efforts, malaria remains a major public health challenge in Africa where annually, ~250,000 children with malaria experience a neurologic injury with subsequent neurodisability.
Evidence indicates that among children with CNS malaria, a higher temperature during the acute illness is a risk factor for post-infectious neurologic sequelae.
As such, aggressive antipyretic therapy may be warranted, at least among children with complicated malaria who are at substantial risk of brain injury.
Previous clinical trials conducted primarily in children with uncomplicated malaria and using only a single antipyretic medication have shown limited benefits in terms of fever reduction; however, no studies to date have examined malaria fever management using dual therapies.
In this clinical trial of aggressive antipyretic therapy, children hospitalized with CNS malaria will be randomized to usual care (acetaminophen every 6 hours for a temperature [&ge;] 38.5{degrees}C) vs. prophylactic acetaminophen and ibuprofen every 6 hours for 72 hours.
This proof-of-concept study will determine whether aggressive antipyretic therapy results in a lower mean maximum temperature relative to usual care.
MethodsWe will enroll 284 participants from three settings at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi; at the University Teaching Hospitals Childrens Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia and at Chipata Central Hospital, Chipata, Zambia.
Parents or guardians must provide written informed consent.
Eligible participants are 2-11 years with evidence of P. falciparum malaria infection by peripheral blood smear or rapid diagnostic test with CNS symptoms associated with malaria.
Eligible children will receive treatment allocation as determined by randomization and will be assigned to treatment groups with 1:1 allocation using blocked randomization.
DiscussionThe clinical trial proposed here seeks to challenge the practice paradigm of limited fever treatment based upon hyperpyrexia by evaluating the fever-reduction efficacy of more aggressive antipyretic use involving two antipyretics and prophylactic administration while also taking advantage of a relatively new method for quantifying total parasite burden (HRP2 quantification) to further characterize malaria severity and elucidate the impact of antipyretics on parasite sequestration and clearance.
If aggressive antipyretic therapy is shown to safely reduce the maximum temperature during CNS malaria, a clinical trial evaluating the neuroprotective effects of temperature reduction in CNS malaria is warranted.

LONG-LASTING INSECTICIDE NETS OWNERSHIP AND MALARIA MORBIDITY IN KRACHI EAST MUNICIPALITY, GHANA  BackgroundMalaria-related morbidity and mortality are issues of great concern to public health globally though, a higher proportion of cases reside within Sub-Saharan Africa.
The situation in Ghana though not new, is very disturbing, as millions of people especially children and pregnant women suffer severely from malaria.
Seasonal chemoprevention and indoor residual spraying are among many measures deployed in the northern parts of Ghana with nationwide outreach and point distribution of LLINs across the country but reports from OPDs indicate millions of malaria cases annually.
ObjectiveTo identify the levels of ownership and usage of the treated bed nets, and describe the relationship between ownership of LLINs and malaria morbidity.
MethodsThe 30-cluster sampling method was deployed.
Using both a modified WHO EPI survey method for more rural areas and a random walk sampling for more urban areas, each community had a listed starting point where the use of a spun pen determined the direction to conduct the surveys within the specified cluster.
Selected households heads/representatives (any adult aged 18 years and above, in a household where the head is absent) participated voluntarily.
STATA version 16.0 was used to run the statistical analysis and the results were presented in tables and figures.
ResultsFindings revealed high levels of ownership of LLINs (73.4%) but moderately low usage levels (49.5%).
Some other uses of LLINs (22.9%) aside from sleeping under them were identified.
Malaria morbidity (59.6%) was also determined.
Multivariate analysis results revealed statistically significant association between some socio-demographic characteristics and LLINs ownership including female sex (AOR = 2.1 (95% CI: 1.15, 3.87) p=0.016), being married (AOR = 3.4 (95% CI: 1.76, 6.74) p<0.001), cohabiting (AOR = 6.1 (95% CI: 2.15, 17.02) p=0.001) and being separated or divorced (AOR = 9.4 (95% CI: 1.09, 81.27) p=0.041).
A positive correlation was identified between ownership of LLINs and their usage.
ConclusionDespite high levels of ownership of LLINs, usage is minimal with a consequential effect on malaria morbidity.
The study recommended service points and periodic household and/or community sensitization on LLINs usage as measures to increase usage levels.
Assessing the knowledge and practices of primary healthcare workers on malaria diagnosis and related challenges in view of COVID-19 outbreak in a Nigerian Southwestern Metropolis  BackgroundThe clinical features of COVID-19 and malaria are interrelated.
Due to the similarity of symptoms between the two disease states, patients can be incorrectly diagnosed with the other ailment in areas with limited health resources.
There is a dearth of knowledge of co-infection between COVID-19 and malaria from healthcare providers perspective.
Hence, this study assessed the ability of primary healthcare workers to diagnose malaria infection correctly from COVID-19 infection.
MethodsA multistage sampling technique was used to select health care workers who were directly involved in malaria case management at 261 government-owned primary health facilities in Oyo State.
Socio-demographic characteristics of respondents, knowledge & practices, COVID-19 differential diagnosis and challenges that healthcare workers face regarding malaria diagnosis were obtained using a standardized electronic structured questionnaire.
Descriptive statistics, bivariate and multivariate analysis were conducted on data collected and significant results were interpreted at a 5% level of significance.
ResultsA good percentage of the respondents (81.6%, 74.3%) had good knowledge about malaria and COVID-19 infection.
However, the knowledge gained did not translate to practice, as majority (86.2%) of respondents had poor malaria diagnosis practices.
Practices relating to COVID-19 differential diagnosis in 69.7% of respondents were also poor.
Most of the respondents attributed poor practices to the unavailability of Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test (mRDT), inadequate training and continuous capacity improvement.
Only 12.3% of the respondents had any form of training on malaria diagnosis and treatment in the last five years.
ConclusionHarmonization of regular trainings and continuous on-the job capacity building is essential to improve case identification, diagnosis and management of both ailments.
Also, uninterrupted supplies of essential commodities such as mRDT in laboratories will reduce missed opportunities for malaria diagnosis.
Improving the efficiency of scale-up and deployment of community health workers in Mali: a geospatial analysis  Optimising the scale and deployment of community health workers (CHWs) is important for maximizing geographical accessibility of integrated primary health care (PHC) services.
We used geospatial analysis to model optimised scale-up and deployment of CHWs in Mali, to inform strategic and operational planning by the Ministry of Health and Social Development.
Accessibility catchments were modelled based on travel time, accounting for barriers to movement.
We compared geographic coverage of the estimated population, under-five deaths, and plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria cases across different hypothetical optimised CHW networks and identified surpluses and deficits of CHWs compared to the existing CHW network.
A network of 15843 CHW, if optimally deployed, would ensure that 77.3% of the population beyond 5 km of the CSCom (community health centre) and CSRef (referral health facility) network would be within a 30-minute walk of a CHW.
The same network would cover an estimated 59.5% of U5 deaths and 58.5% of Pf malaria cases.
As an intermediary step, an optimised network of 4500 CHW, primarily filling deficits of CHW in the regions of Kayes, Koulikoro, Sikasso, and Segou would ensure geographic coverage for 31.3% of the estimated population.
There were no important differences in geographic coverage percentage when prioritizing CHW scale-up and deployment based on the estimated population, U5 deaths, or Pf malaria cases.
Our geospatial analysis provides useful information to policymakers and planners in Mali for optimising the scale-up and deployment of CHW and, in turn, for maximizing the value-for-money of resources of investment in CHWs in the context of the countrys health sector reform.
Countries with similar interests in optimising the scale and deployment of their CHW workforce may look to Mali as an exemplar model from which to learn.
Pilot study to evaluate hypercoagulation and inflammation using rotational thromboelastometry and calprotectin in COVID-19 patients.
IntroductionAbnormal coagulation and inflammation are hallmarks of SARs-COV-19.
Stratifying affected patients on admission to hospital may help identify those who are risk of developing severe disease early on.
ROTEM is a point of care test that can be used to measure abnormal coagulation and calprotectin is a measure of inflammation.
AimAssess if ROTEM can measure hypercoagulability on admission and identify those who will develop severe disease early on.
Assess if calprotectin can measure inflammation and if there is a correlation with ROTEM and calprotectin.
MethodsCOVID-19 patients were recruited on admission and ROTEM testing was undertaken daily for a period of 7 days.
Additionally inflammatory marker calprotectin was also tested.
Results33 patients were recruited to the study out of which 13 were admitted to ITU and 20 were treated on the ward.
ROTEM detected a hypercoagulable state on admission but did not stratify between those admitted to a ward or escalated to ITU.
Calprotectin levels were raised but there was no statistical difference (p=0.73) between groups.
Significant correlations were observed between FIBA5 (p<0.00), FIBCFT (p<0.00), FIBMCF (p<0.00) and INMCF (p<0.00) and calprotectin.
ConclusionCOVID19 patients were hypercoagulable in admission.
The correlations between ROTEM and calprotectin underline the interactions between inflammation and coagulation.
Impact of a blood-stage vaccine on Plasmodium vivax malaria  BackgroundThere are no licensed vaccines against Plasmodium vivax, the most common cause of malaria outside of Africa.
MethodsWe conducted two Phase I/IIa clinical trials to assess the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of two vaccines targeting region II of P. vivax Duffy-binding protein (PvDBPII).
Recombinant viral vaccines (using ChAd63 and MVA vectors) were administered at 0, 2 months or in a delayed dosing regimen (0, 17, 19 months), whilst a protein/adjuvant formulation (PvDBPII/Matrix-M) was administered monthly (0, 1, 2 months) or in a delayed dosing regimen (0, 1, 14 months).
Delayed regimens were due to trial halts during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Volunteers underwent heterologous controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) with blood-stage P. vivax parasites at 2-4 weeks following their last vaccination, alongside unvaccinated controls.
Efficacy was assessed by comparison of parasite multiplication rate (PMR) in blood post-CHMI, modelled from parasitemia measured by quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (qPCR).
ResultsThirty-two volunteers were enrolled and vaccinated (n=16 for each vaccine).
PvDBPII/Matrix-M, given in the delayed dosing regimen, elicited the highest antibody responses and reduced the mean PMR following CHMI by 51% (range 36-66%; n=6) compared to unvaccinated controls (n=13).
No other vaccine or regimen impacted parasite growth.
In vivo growth inhibition of blood-stage P. vivax correlated with functional antibody readouts of vaccine immunogenicity.
ConclusionsVaccination of malaria-naive adults with a delayed booster regimen of PvDBPII/ Matrix-M significantly reduces the growth of blood-stage P. vivax.

Investigation of antibodies against Chikungunya, Dengue and Zika virus in serum samples from febrile patients and its co-ocurrence with malaria in six districts highly endemic for malaria in Mozambique between 2017 - 2018  IntroductionArboviruses and malaria are both mosquito-borne diseases, with overlapping symptoms and geographic distribution in tropical settings.
However, little information is available on the co-occurrence of arboviruses and malaria in areas highly endemic for malaria in Africa.
This study was conducted with the aim to determine the frequency of recent Dengue (DENV), Chikungunya (CHIKV) and Zika (ZIKV) infections and their co-occurrence with malaria in six highly endemic districts for malaria in Mozambique.
MethodsBlood samples were collected from febrile outpatients between January 2017 and December 2018 and were then tested for Malaria using RDT.
Serum samples from these patients were also tested using commercially available ELISA for the presence of IgM antibodies against CHIKV, ZIKV and DENV, as well as NS1 antigen for DENV.
Concurrently, a questionnaire was administered to collect socio-demographic characteristics of patients.
ResultsOf the 906 participants enrolled, IgM antibodies against CHIKV, DENV and ZIKV were identified in 134 (14.8%), 64 (7.4%) and 83 (9.2%) individuals, respectively.
Malaria was diagnosed in 56 (6.2%) participants, of which 16 (28.6%) were also positive for IgM anti CHIKV, 1 (1.8%) for DENV-NS1, 3 (5.4%) for IgM anti-DENV and 10 (17.8%) for IgM anti-ZIKV.
There was a trend towards an increase in the frequency of IgM anti CHIKV positive samples, from 7.0% in 2014 to 14.8% in 2018 and IgM anti-ZIKV positive samples increased from 4.9% in 2015 to 9.2% in 2018.
ConclusionThis study showed an increased frequency of arbovirus in Mozambique thus far, as well as a frequent occurrence of arbovirus among malaria positive patients.
This highlighted the urgency for the establishment of sentinel surveillance sites for arboviruses and the need for an integrated management of febrile illnesses in places where arboviruses and malaria are both prevalent.
AUTHOR SUMMARYArbovirus and malaria share clinical features, which might make the differential diagnosis of acute febrile illnesses significantly difficult, leading to frequent over diagnosis of malaria and under diagnosis of arbovirus in places where both co-occur.
In Mozambique and other sub-Saharan countries, epidemiological data on the burden and temporal trend of arbovirus, as well as on co-occurrence with malaria are Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Dengue virus (DENV) and its co-occurrence with malaria among 609 febrile patients in six health centres located in five provinces in Mozambique.
Recent CHIKV, DENV and ZIKV infection, as measured by presence of IgM antibodies, were found in 14.8%, 7.4% and 9.2% of participants and among 28.6%, 5.4% and 17.8%, of malaria positive patients.
These findings suggest that arboviruses are frequent among malaria and non-malaria febrile patients, reinforcing the need for increased awareness of arbovirus in the management of acute febrile illness.
Predictive performance of multi-model ensemble forecasts of COVID-19 across European nations  BackgroundShort-term forecasts of infectious disease burden can contribute to situational awareness and aid capacity planning.
Based on best practice in other fields and recent insights in infectious disease epidemiology, one can maximise the predictive performance of such forecasts if multiple models are combined into an ensemble.
Here we report on the performance of ensembles in predicting COVID-19 cases and deaths across Europe between 08 March 2021 and 07 March 2022.
MethodsWe used open-source tools to develop a public European COVID-19 Forecast Hub.
We invited groups globally to contribute weekly forecasts for COVID-19 cases and deaths reported from a standardised source over the next one to four weeks.
Teams submitted forecasts from March 2021 using standardised quantiles of the predictive distribution.
Each week we created an ensemble forecast, where each predictive quantile was calculated as the equally-weighted average (initially the mean and then from 26th July the median) of all individual models predictive quantiles.
ResultsOver 52 weeks we collected and combined up to 28 forecast models for 32 countries.
We found a weekly ensemble had a consistently strong performance across countries over time.
Across all horizons and locations, the ensemble performed better on relative WIS than 84% of participating models forecasts of incident cases (with a total N=862), and 92% of participating models forecasts of deaths (N=746).
Across a one to four week time horizon, ensemble performance declined with longer forecast periods when forecasting cases, but remained stable over four weeks for incident death forecasts.
Among several choices of ensemble methods we found that the most influential and best choice was to use a median average of models instead of using the mean, regardless of methods of weighting component forecast models.
ConclusionsOur results support the use of combining forecasts from individual models into an ensemble in order to improve predictive performance across epidemiological targets and populations during infectious disease epidemics.
Our findings further suggest that median ensemble methods yield better predictive performance more than ones based on means.

Diagnostic accuracy and limit of detection of ten malaria parasite lactate dehydrogenase-based rapid tests for Plasmodium knowlesi and P. falciparum  BackgroundPlasmodium knowlesi causes zoonotic malaria across Southeast Asia.
First-line diagnostic microscopy cannot reliably differentiate P. knowlesi from other human malaria species.
Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) designed for P. falciparum and P. vivax are used routinely in P. knowlesi co-endemic areas despite potential cross-reactivity for species-specific antibody targets.

Targets included Plasmodium-genus parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pan-pLDH) and P. vivax (Pv)-pLDH.
ResultsSamples were collected prior to antimalarial treatment from 127 patients with microscopy-positive PCR-confirmed P. knowlesi mono-infections.
Median parasitaemia was 788/{micro}L (IQR 247-5,565/{micro}L).
Pan-pLDH sensitivities ranged from 50.6% (95% CI 39.6-61.5) (SD BIOLINE) to 87.0% (95% CI 75.1-94.6) (First Response(R) and CareStart PAN) compared to reference PCR.
Pv-pLDH RDTs detected P. knowlesi with up to 92.0% (95% CI 84.3-96.7%) sensitivity (Biocredit).
For parasite counts [&ge;]200/{micro}L, pan-pLDH (Standard Q) and Pv-pLDH RDTs exceeded 95% sensitivity.
Specificity of RDTs against 26 PCR-confirmed negative controls was 100%.
Sensitivity of the 6 highest performing RDTs were not significantly different when comparing samples taken before and after (median 3 hours) antimalarial treatment.
Parasite ring stages were present in 30% of pre-treatment samples, with ring stage proportions (mean 1.9%) demonstrating inverse correlation with test positivity of Biocredit and two CareStart RDTs.
For cultured P. knowlesi, CareStart PAN demonstrated the lowest LoD at 25 parasites/{micro}L; LoDs of other pan-pLDH ranged from 98 to >2000 parasites/{micro}L. Pv-pLDH LoD for P. knowlesi was 49 parasites/{micro}L. P. falciparum-pLDH or histidine-rich-protein-2 channels did not react with P. knowlesi.

Hill numbers at the edge of a pandemic: rapid SARS-COV2 surveillance without alignments or trees  The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical role of genomic surveillance for guiding policy and control strategies.
Millions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been assembled, the largest collection of sequence data in history.
Phylogenetic methods are ill equipped to handle this sheer scale.
We introduce a pan-genomic measure that examines the information diversity of a k-mer library drawn from a countrys complete set of clinical, pooled, or wastewater sequence.
The more diverse the sample, the higher the Hill number.
We adopt this ecological approach and consider each k-mer an individual and each genome a transect in the pan-genome of the species.
Applying Hill numbers in this way allows us to summarize the temporal trajectory of pandemic variants by collapsing each days assemblies into genomic equivalents.
For pooled or wastewater sequence, we instead compare sets of days represented by survey sequence divorced from individual infections.
We do both calculations quickly, without alignment or trees, using modern genome sketching techniques to accommodate millions of genomes or terabases of raw sequence in one condensed view of pandemic dynamics.
Using data from the UK, USA, and South Africa, we trace the ascendance of new variants of concern as they emerge in local populations months before these variants are named and added to phylogenetic databases.
This history of emerging variants senses all available data as it is sequenced, intimating variant sweeps to dominance or declines to extinction at the leading edge of the COVID19 pandemic.
The surveillance technique we introduce in a SARS-CoV-2 context here can operate on genomic data generated over any pandemic time course and is organism agnostic.
One-Sentence SummaryWe implement pathogen surveillance from sequence streams in real-time, requiring neither references or phylogenetics.
Main TextThe COVID-19 pandemic has been fueled by the repeated emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, a few of which have propelled worldwide, asynchronous waves of infection(1).
First arising in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, the spread of the D614G mutation led to sequential waves of Variants of Concern (VOC) about nine months later, significantly broadening the pandemics reach and challenging concerted efforts at its control (2).
Beta and Gamma variants drove regional resurgences, but Alpha, Delta and Omicron occurred globally (3)(4).
The advent of each variant led to the near extinction of the population within which it arose (5).
The architecture of this pandemic is therefore marked by periods of transition, tipping a population towards an emerging variant of concern followed by its near complete sweep to dominance.
At the pandemics outset, epidemiological work was focused on transmission networks, but SARS-CoV-2s high rates of infection quickly outstripped our ability to trace it(2).
When it became clear that even focused global efforts would only characterize a fraction of infections, researchers turned to phylodynamic approaches to understand SARS-CoV-2s population structure(6)(7).
Genomics was at the center of this effort.
Rapid sequencing and whole genome phylogeny updated in quasi real time enabled epidemic surveillance that was a few weeks to a month behind the edge of the pandemic curve(8).
In a crisis of COVID-19s scale and speed, eliminating this analysis lag can mean the difference between timely, reasonable public health response and failure to understand and anticipate the diseases next turn.
Phylodynamics is predicated on genetic variation.
Without variation, phylogenetic approaches yield star trees with no evolutionary structure.
The high mutation rate among pathogens, especially among RNA viruses like SARS-CoV2, ensures the accumulation of sufficient diversity to reconstruct pathogen evolutionary history even over the relatively short time scales that comprise an outbreak.
But as a genomic surveillance technique, phylodynamics is costly.
Tools like Nextstrain align genomes, reconstruct phylogenies, and date internal nodes using Bayesian and likelihood approaches(9).
These techniques are among the most computationally expensive algorithms in bioinformatics.
More importantly, phylodynamic approaches are yoked to references.
We argue that genomic surveillance should herald the appearance of previously unseen variants without having to resort to comparison with assembled and curated genomes, and the lag between variant discovery and a database update is often months.
Surveillance is currently hamstrung by the historical bias inherent to marker-based analysis.
We propose a method that summarizes the temporal trajectory of pandemic variants by collapsing each days assemblies into a single metric.
In the case of pooled or wastewater sequence, this same metric is repurposed to measure survey sequence compression across days.
Our method does not subsample, perform alignments, or build trees, but still describes the major arcs of the COVID19 pandemic.
We employ Hill numbers (10)(11), extensions of Shannons theory of information entropy(12).
For example, we envision each unique k-mer a species and each genome a transect sampled from the pan-genome.
Applying Hill numbers in this way allows us to measure a collection of genomes in terms of genomic equivalents, or a set of sequence pools as the effective number of sets.
We show that tracing a pandemic curve with these new metrics enables the use of sequence as a real time sensor, tracking both the emergence of variants over time and the extent of their spread.
Factors associated with the uptake of Intermittent Preventive Treatment (IPTp-SP) for malaria in pregnancy: further analysis of the 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey  Pregnancy-associated malaria is preventable and curable with intermittent preventive treatment with Sulfodoxine-Pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP).
However, despite the effectiveness of IPTp-SP against malaria in pregnancy, the uptake among pregnant women in Nigeria remains very low.
Thus, this study aimed to establish the factors associated with the uptake of at least one dose and optimal doses of IPTp-SP among pregnant women aged 15 to 49 years living in Nigeria in 2018.
The study included 12,742 women aged 15 to 49 years with live births two years before or during the 2018 Nigeria Demographic Health Survey (NDHS) in the analysis.
Descriptive analysis was carried out to determine the prevalence of IPTp-SP uptake.
Multivariable logistic regression was used to establish the factors associated with receiving IPTp-SP during pregnancy, adjusting for possible confounding factors.
The p-value of <0.05 was considered significant.
In 2018, the prevalence of at least one dose of IPTp-SP was 63.6% (95% CI:62.0-65.1), and optimal doses of IPTp-SP were 16.8% (95% CI:15.8-17.8) during pregnancy.
After the multivariable analysis, age group, region, frequency of ANC visits, belief in IPTp-SP effectiveness, and morbidity caused by malaria predicted the uptake of at least one IPTp-SP dose.
Similar maternal characteristics, including household wealth index, spouses educational level and media exposure, were significantly associated with taking optimal IPTp-SP doses.
For instance, women in the wealthiest households whose husbands had secondary education predicted a four-fold increase in uptake of at least one IPTp-SP dose (aOR:4.17; 95% CI:1.11-8.85).
The low prevalence and regional variations of IPTp-SP uptake in the study area imply that most pregnant women in Nigeria are at substantial risk of pregnancy-associated malaria.
Therefore, stakeholders should explore context-specific strategies to improve the IPTp-SP coverage across the regions in Nigeria.
Repeat controlled human malaria infection of healthy UK adults with blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum: safety and parasite growth dynamics  In endemic settings it is known that natural malaria immunity is gradually acquired following repeated exposures.
Here we sought to assess whether similar acquisition of blood-stage malaria immunity would occur following repeated parasite exposure by controlled human malaria infection (CHMI).
We report the findings of a repeat homologous blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum (3D7 clone) CHMI study (VAC063C; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03906474).
In total, 24 healthy, unvaccinated, malaria-naive UK adult participants underwent primary CHMI followed by drug treatment.
Ten of these then underwent secondary CHMI in the same manner, and then six of these underwent a final tertiary CHMI.
As with primary CHMI, malaria symptoms were common following secondary and tertiary infection, however, most resolved within a few days of treatment and there were no long term sequelae or serious adverse events related to CHMI.
Despite detectable induction and boosting of anti-merozoite serum IgG antibody responses following each round of CHMI, there was no clear evidence of anti-parasitic immunity (manifest as reduced parasite growth in vivo) conferred by repeated challenge with the homologous parasite in the majority of volunteers.
However, three volunteers showed some variation in parasite growth dynamics in vivo following repeat CHMI that were either modest or short-lived.
We also observed no major differences in clinical symptoms or laboratory markers of infection across the primary, secondary and tertiary challenges.
However, there was a trend to more severe pyrexia after primary CHMI and the absence of a detectable transaminitis post-treatment following secondary and tertiary infection.
We hypothesize that this could represent the initial induction of disease tolerance or clinical malaria immunity.
Repeat homologous blood-stage CHMI is thus safe and provides a model with the potential to further the understanding of the acquisition of blood-stage immunity in a highly controlled setting.
Quantitative G6PD point-of-care test can be used reliably on cord blood to identify male and female newborns at increased risk of neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia: a mixed method study  IntroductionNew point-of-care (POC) quantitative G6PD testing devices developed to provide safe radical cure for P. vivax malaria may be used to diagnose G6PD deficiency in newborns at risk of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia, improving clinical care, and preventing related morbidity and mortality.
Methods: We conducted a mixed-methods study analyzing technical performance and usability of the "STANDARD G6PD" Biosensor when used by trained midwives on cord blood samples at two rural clinics on the Thailand-Myanmar border.
ResultsIn 307 cord blood samples, the Biosensor had a sensitivity of 1.000 (95%CI 0.859-1.000) and a specificity of 0.993 (95% CI 0.971-0.999) as compared to gold standard spectrophotometry to diagnose G6PD deficient newborns using a receiving operator characteristic (ROC) analysis-derived threshold of [&le;]4.8IU/gHb.
The Biosensor had a sensitivity of 0.727 (95%CI: 0.498-0.893) and specificity of 0.933 (95%CI: 0.876-0.969) for 30-70% activity range in females using ROC analysis-derived range of 4.9 to 9.9IU/gHb.
These thresholds allowed identification of all G6PD deficient neonates and 80% of female neonates with intermediate phenotypes.
Need of phototherapy treatment for neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia was higher in neonates with deficient and intermediate phenotypes as diagnosed by either reference spectrophotometry or Biosensor.
Focus group discussions found high levels of learnability, willingness, satisfaction, and suitability for the Biosensor in this setting.
The staff valued the capacity of the Biosensor to identify newborns with G6PD deficiency early ("We can know that early, we can counsel the parents about the chances of their children getting jaundice") and at the POC, including in more rural settings ("Because we can know the right result of the G6PD deficiency in a short time.
Especially for the clinic which does not have a lab").
Conclusions: The Biosensor is a suitable tool in this resource-constrained setting to identify newborns with abnormal G6PD phenotypes at increased risk of neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia.
A systematic review of dengue outbreak prediction models: current scenario and future directions  Dengue is among the fastest-spreading vector-borne infectious disease, with outbreaks often overwhelm the health system and result in huge morbidity and mortality in its endemic populations in the absence of an efficient warning system.
A large number of prediction models are currently in use globally.
As such, this study aimed to systematically review the published literature that used quantitative models to predict dengue outbreaks and provide insights about the current practices.
A systematic search was undertaken, using the Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science databases for published citations, without time or geographical restrictions.
Study selection, data extraction and management process were devised in accordance with the  Checklist for Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies ( CHARMS) framework.
A total of 78 models were included in the review from 51 studies.
Most models sourced climate (89.7%) and climate change (82.4%) data from agency reports and only 59.0% of the models adjusted for reporting time lag.
All included models used climate predictors; 65.4% of them were built with only climate factors.
Climate factors were used in combination with climate change factors (10.3%), both climate change and demographic factors (10.3%), vector factors (5.1%), and demographic factors (5.1%).
Machine learning techniques were used for 38.5% of the models.
Of these, random forest (20.0%), neural networks (23.3%) and ensemble models (13.3%) were notable.
Among the statistical (61.5%) models, linear regression (20.8%), Poisson regression (18.8%), generalized additive models (16.7%) and time series/autoregressive models (18.8%) were notable.
Around 24.4% of the models reported no validation at all and only 6.4% reported external validation.
The reporting of methodology and model performance measures were inadequate in many of the existing prediction models.
Effectiveness of three-year old piperonyl butoxide and pyrethroid-treated long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) versus pyrethroid-only LLINs against malaria infection: results of a cluster randomised trial in Tanzania  BackgroundAfter decades of success in reducing malaria through the scale-up of pyrethroid long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), malaria decline has stalled, coinciding with the rapid spread of pyrethroid resistance.
A new class of net, treated with a mixture of a pyrethroid and a synergist, piperonyl butoxide (PBO), demonstrated superior efficacy compared to standard (std) pyrethroid LLINs against malaria in an area of intense pyrethroid resistance, reducing malaria prevalence by 44% over 2 years in the present trial.
However, an important question is left unanswered regarding the performance of this PBO-LLIN over the World Health Organization recommended lifespan of 3 years for LLINs.
Methods and FindingsWe conducted a four-arm randomized controlled trial using a two-by-two factorial design that evaluated the effectiveness of PBO-LLIN arms (12 clusters PBO-LLIN alone and 12 clusters PBO-LLIN + Indoor Residual Spraying; IRS) compared to std-LLIN (12 clusters std-LLIN alone and 12 clusters std-LLIN + IRS) and IRS arms versus no IRS arms from January 2014 to December 2017 in Muleba, Tanzania.
Malaria infection prevalence in 80 children, 6 months to 14 years, per cluster was measured twice a year and analysed in an intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) approach.
Density of malaria mosquito vectors and entomological inoculation rate (EIR) were assessed monthly in 7 houses per cluster.
Logistic regression allowing for within cluster correlation of responses was used to compare malaria prevalence between PBO-LLIN groups vs std-LLIN groups and IRS groups vs no IRS groups during the third-year follow-up at 28- and 33-months post-intervention.
No further IRS was conducted after the first spray round in 2015; as yearly IRS is recommended by WHO, results need to be interpreted in light of this limitation.
Vector density and EIR were analysed using negative binomial regression.
Malaria results were available for 7471 children.
At 28 months, malaria infection prevalence was lower in the PBO-LLIN groups (69.3%) compared to the std-LLIN groups (80.9%, Odds Ratio: 0.45, 95% Confidence Interval: 0.21-0.95, p value: 0.0364).
The effect was weaker at 33 months post-intervention (OR: 0.60, 95%CI:0.32-1.13, p value: 0.1131), in the ITT analysis but still evident in the PP analysis (OR: 0.34, 95%CI: 0.16-0.71, p value: 0.0051).
At this time point, net usage in household participants was 31% and PBO concentration in PBO-LLINs was reduced by 96% compared to those of new nets.
A total of 17,451 Anopheles mosquitoes were collected during the 3150 collection nights done in the third year.
There was no reduction in EIR (DR: 0.63, 95%CI: 0.25-1.61, p value: 0.3296) between the PBO groups and std-LLIN groups or between IRS and no IRS groups (DR: 0.7, 95%CI: 0.41-2.28, p value: 0.9426).
ConclusionsPBO-LLINs no longer provided community protection from malaria infection, compared to std-LLINs by the third year of use due to low net usage.
Children still sleeping under PBO-LLINs had lower odds of infection than those sleeping under a std-LLIN, however prevalence remained unacceptably high.
It is urgent that net distribution frequencies and effective lifespan of this class of LLIN are aligned for maximum impact.

Long COVID in Cancer patients: Preponderance of Symptoms in Majority of Patients over Long Time Period  BackgroundAn increasing number of observational studies have reported the persistence of symptoms following recovery from acute COVID-19 disease in non-cancer patients.
The long-term consequences of COVID-19 are not fully understood particularly in the cancer patient population.
The purpose of this study is to assess post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) in cancer patients following acute COVID-19 recovery.
MethodsWe identified cancer patients at MD Anderson Cancer Center who were diagnosed with COVID-19 disease between March 1, 2020 and Sept 1, 2020 and followed them till May 2021.
To assess PASC, we collected patients reported outcomes through questionnaires that were sent to patients daily for 14 days after COVID-19 diagnosis then weekly for 3 months, and then monthly thereafter.
We also reviewed patients electronic medical records to capture the the persistence or emergence of new COVID19-related symptoms reported during any clinic or hospital encounter beyond 30 days of the acute illness and up to 14 months.
ResultsWe included 312 cancer patients with a median age of 57 years (18-86).
The majority of patients had solid tumors (75%).
Of the 312 patients, 188 (60%) reported long COVID-19 symptoms with a median duration of 7 months and up to 14 months after COVID-19 diagnosis.
The most common symptoms reported included fatigue (82%), sleep disturbances (78%), myalgias (67%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (61%), followed by headache, altered smell or taste, dyspnea (47%) and cough (46%).
A higher number of females reported a persistence of symptoms compared to males (63% vs 37%; p=0.036).
Cancer type, neutropenia, lymphocytopenia, and hospital admission during acute COVID-19 disease were comparable in both groups.
Among the 188 patients with PASC, only 16 (8.5%) were readmitted for COVID-related reasons.
ConclusionsMore than one out of two cancer patients, and more likely females, report PASC that may persist beyond 6 months and even one year.
The most common symptoms are non-respiratory and consist of fatigue, sleep disturbance, myalgia and gastro-intestinal symptoms.
Most of the cancer patients with PASC were managed on outpatient basis with only 8,5% requiring a COVID-19 related re-admission.
Dengue seroprevalence study during COVID-19 pandemic in Bali  IntroductionDengue infection poses significant public health problems in tropical and subtropical regions all over the world.
The clinical manifestation of dengue varies from asymptomatic cases to severe dengue manifestation.
The detection of clinical cases enables us to measure the incidence of dengue infection, whereas serological surveys give insights into the prevalence of infection.
This study aimed to determine the dengue prevalence among healthy adult patients in Bali.
MethodCross-sectional seroprevalence surveys were performed from July 2020 to June 2021 among healthy and adult patients in Denpasar Bali.
Blood samples were collected from 539 randomly selected samples from urban sites in Denpasar.
IgG antibodies against DENV were detected in serum using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit.
ResultsOverall, the positive dengue seroprevalence rate among 539 clinically healthy adult patients was high (85.5%).
The subjects median age was 34.1 (range between 18-86.1) years old.
Most participants in the study were younger than 40 years old (61.2%).
The study found a significant association of dengue seropositivity among people age more than 40 years old with healthy status (p=0.005 and p<0.001, respectively).
Another seroprevalence study reported a lower rate of dengue infection in children in Indonesia (69.4%).
The difference may be associated with less probability of Aedes bites among the children.
The study reflected the proportion of asymptomatic dengue that needs better assessment with a serological test.
ConclusionThe current study highlighted a high prevalence of dengue seropositive with a relatively dominant proportion of asymptomatic cases.
The study guides the physicians o to beware of every dengue infection in tropical countries and prevents the spread of the disease.
Apolipoprotein A1 levels and its association with NS1 in the pathogenesis of acute dengue  BackgroundThe dengue NS1 antigen is a secretory protein and was shown to associate with apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1).
Therefore, we sought to investigate the changes in ApoA1 levels in patients with varying severity of acute dengue and then proceeded to investigate how ApoA1 and NS1 interactions affect cytokine production from primary human monocytes.
Methodology/Principal FindingsSerial measurements of ApoA1, viral loads, NS1 antigen levels and lipid profiles were done in adult patients with dengue fever (DF= 21) and dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF =28).
To investigate the effect of ApoA1-NS1 interactions in cytokine production from primary human monocytes, cells were harvested from healthy individuals (n=6) and co-cultured with varying concentrations of ApoA1 and levels of IL-6 and TNF- measured in culture supernatants.
The ApoA1 levels were significantly lower in patients with DHF on day 5 of illness (p=0.04) compared to those with DF.
ApoA1 levels did not show any correlation with either the NS1 antigen levels or the viral loads in patients with DF or DHF, although they did significantly and inversely correlate with liver transaminases, AST (Spearmans R=-0.55, p <0.0001) and ALT (Spearmans R=-0.49, p<0.0001) in patients with DF.
However, a significant correlation was not seen between ApoA1 levels and AST levels (Spearmans R=-0.45, p=0.09) in patients with DHF and ALT levels (Spearmans R=0.0.5, p=0.64).
HDL and LDL levels were significantly lower on day 5 of the illness in patients with DHF compared to those with DF.
Co-culture of NS1 and ApoA1 resulted in an increased IL-6 production (but not TNF) in culture supernatants in a dose dependent manner.
Conclusions/SignificanceHDL, LDL and ApoA1 levels were significantly lower in those who have severe dengue, especially in the critical phase and ApoA1 levels inversely correlated with the extent of rise in liver enzymes.
While co-culture of ApoA1 with NS1 in primary human monocytes induced high IL-6 levels in a dose dependent manner, this was not seen for TNF suggesting that the interaction of ApoA1 with NS1 could give rise to different outcomes.

Perceptions and priorities for the development of multiplex rapid diagnostic tests for acute non-malarial fever in rural South and Southeast Asia: an international modified e-Delphi survey  BackgroundFever is a common presenting symptom in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
It was previously assumed that malaria was the cause in such patients, but its incidence has declined rapidly.
The urgent need to develop point-of-care tests for the most important causes of non-malarial acute febrile illness is hampered by the lack of robust epidemiological data.
We sought to obtain expert consensus on analytes which should be prioritized for inclusion in fingerprick blood-based multiplex lateral flow rapid diagnostic tests (LF-RDTs) targeted towards four categories of patients with acute non-malarial fever in South and Southeast Asian LMICs, stratified by age (paediatric vs. adult) and care setting (primary vs. secondary care).
We sought to obtain expert consensus on analytes which should be prioritized for inclusion in fingerprick blood-based multiplex lateral flow rapid diagnostic tests (LF-RDTs) targeted towards four categories of patients with acute non-malarial fever in South and Southeast Asian LMICs, stratified by age (paediatric vs. adult) and care setting (primary vs. secondary care).
Methodology/Principal FindingsWe conducted a two-round modified e-Delphi survey.
A total of 84 panellists were invited, consisting of seven each from 12 countries, divided into three regional panels (Mainland Southeast Asia, Maritime Southeast Asia, and South Asia).
Thirty-six panellists (43%) participated in the first round and 44 (52%) in the second.
There was consensus that such LF-RDTs should be incorporated into clinical decision support tools.
At a minimum, these LF-RDTs should be able to diagnose dengue and enteric fever in all patient categories.
There was a clear preference to develop LF-RDTs for pathogens not readily detected by existing technologies, and for direct diagnosis through antigen detection.
Pathogen biomarkers were prioritized over host inflammatory biomarkers, with CRP being the only one ranked consistently highly.
Conclusions/SignificanceOur results provide guidance on prioritizing analytes for inclusion in context-specific multiplex LF-RDTs and similar platforms for non-malarial acute febrile illness, for which there is an urgent unmet need.
AUTHOR SUMMARYIn rural South and Southeast Asia, most acute febrile illness was previously attributable to malaria but the incidence of malaria is declining.
To aid diagnosis and prognosis in patients presenting with the common symptom of acute fever with no localising features but in whom malaria has been excluded, there is an urgent need to develop minimally-invasive rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) which can test for multiple pathogen and host biomarkers.
Obtaining expert consensus opinions on what biomarkers these tests should detect will contribute greatly to their development, but there is a paucity of robust epidemiological data on the diverse non-malarial causes of acute fever.
We determined the biomarkers which should be included in region-specific fingerprick blood-based RDTs tailored to four patient categories differentiated by age and level of care, in the form of seven-item lists ranked in decreasing order of priority.
Our results provide essential region-specific guidance to aid development of RDTs for acute non-malarial fever, for which there was strong consensus for their inclusion in clinical decision-making tools for low- and semi-skilled healthcare staff.
An archetypes approach to malaria intervention impact mapping: a new framework and example application.
BackgroundAs both mechanistic and geospatial malaria modeling methods become more integrated into malaria policy decisions, there is increasing demand for strategies that combine these two methods.
This paper introduces a novel archetypes-based methodology for generating high-resolution intervention impact maps based on mechanistic model simulations.
MethodsFirst, dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques were applied to rasterized geospatial environmental and mosquito covariates to find archetypal malaria transmission patterns.
Next, mechanistic models were run on a representative site from each archetype to assess intervention impact.
Finally, these mechanistic results were reprojected onto each pixel to generate full maps of intervention impact.
The example configuration used ERA5 and Malaria Atlas Project covariates, singular value decomposition, k-means clustering, and the Institute for Disease Modelings EMOD model to explore a range of three-year malaria interventions primarily focused on vector control and case management.
Example intervention impact curves and maps highlighted archetype-specific variation in efficacy of vector control interventions.
ConclusionThis paper introduces a novel methodology which combines the richness of spatiotemporal mapping with the rigor of mechanistic modeling to create a multi-purpose infrastructure for answering a broad range of important questions in the malaria policy space.
It is flexible and adaptable to a range of input covariates, mechanistic models, and mapping strategies and can be adapted to the modelers setting of choice.
Serum biomarkers and anti-flavivirus antibodies at presentation as indicators of severe dengue  BackgroundDengue is the most common vector-borne viral disease worldwide.
Most cases are mild, but some evolve into severe dengue (SD), with high lethality.
Therefore, it is important to identify biomarkers of severe disease to improve outcomes and judiciously utilize resources.
Methods/Principal FindingsOne hundred forty-five confirmed dengue cases (median age, 42; range <1-91 years), enrolled from February 2018 to March 2020, were selected from an ongoing study of suspected arboviral infections in the Asuncion metropolitan area.
Cases included dengue virus types 1, 2, and 4, and severity was categorized according to the 2009 World Health Organization guidelines.
Serologic and biomarker (lipopolysaccharide binding protein and chymase) testing were performed on acute-phase samples by ELISA; additional serologic testing was performed with the multiplex pGOLD assay.
Complete blood counts and chemistries were performed at the discretion of the care team.
Age, gender, and pre-existing comorbidities were associated with SD vs. dengue with/without warning signs in logistic regression with odds ratios (ORs) of 1.06 (per year; 95% confidence interval, 1.02, 1.10), 0.12 (female; 0.03,0.5), and 9.82 (presence; 1.92, 50.24) respectively.
In binary logistic regression, for every unit increase in anti-DENV IgG in the pGOLD assay, odds of SD increased by 2.54 (1.19-5.42).
Platelet count, lymphocyte percent, and elevated chymase were associated with SD in a combined logistic regression model with ORs of 0.99 (1,000/L; 0.98,0.999), 0.92 (%; 0.86,0.98), and 1.17 (mg/mL; 1.03,1.33) respectively.
ConclusionsMultiple, readily available factors were associated with SD in this population.
These findings will aid in the early detection of potentially severe dengue cases and inform the development of new prognostics for use in acute-phase and serial samples from dengue cases.
Author SummaryDengue fever is an acute disease caused by dengue virus and transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes.
Dengue is the most common vector-borne viral disease worldwide affecting an estimated 50-100 million people and with 10,000 dengue-related deaths each year.
Most dengue cases present with nonspecific mild symptoms, but some will evolve into severe dengue, which can be fatal.
Early detection and subsequent timely treatment have been shown to decrease mortality among severe cases.
In this study we analyze demographic factors, clinical laboratory data, lipopolysaccharide binding protein and chymase to evaluate associations with disease severity.
This study was carried out in Paraguay, which is a hyperendemic country for dengue where the disease has been understudied.
A number of factors were found to be associated with severe disease in this population, including patient age, male gender, presence of comorbid illnesses, low platelet count, low lymphocyte percentage, and elevated chymase level.
Malaria prevention knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) among adolescents living in an area of persistent transmission in Senegal: Results from a cross-sectional study  IntroductionWhile malaria morbidity has sharply declined in several areas in Senegal, it remains an important problem in the southern part of the country, particularly among adolescents.
Understanding adolescents knowledge, attitudes, prevention and care-seeking practices is important to inform more targeted interventions aimed at optimizing adolescents uptake of malaria prevention and control measures.
This study assessed malaria-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) among adolescents living in a highly persistent transmission area in Senegal.
MethodsA community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 391 adolescents living in the Saraya health district.
A multistage random sampling technique was used to select households.
An electronic questionnaire developed on Open Data Kit (ODK), was used to collect data on socio-demographic characteristics, household assets, adolescents knowledge of malaria, as well as their attitudes with regards to malaria prevention, and care-seeking behaviors.
Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess factors associated with adolescents KAP towards malaria.
ResultsNearly, one-third of the participants had good knowledge of malaria (34.4%) and good practice in regards to malaria preventive measures (32.8%) while approximately three-quarters had a positive attitude (75.1%) and good care-seeking behavior (73.8%) regarding malaria.
Multivariate analysis revealed that a primary (aOR=5.43, p=0.002) or secondary level of education (aOR=10.41, p=0.000) was associated with good knowledge of malaria transmission, signs, and prevention measures.
Male individuals had lower knowledge compared to female ones (aOR=0.40, p=0.001).
Individuals belonging to households from the fourth (aOR=0.29, p=0.015), second (OR=0.13, p=0.000), and lowest (aOR=0.18, p=0.001) wealth quintiles were less likely to have a positive attitude towards malaria compared to those from households in the highest wealth quintile.
A positive attitude was two times more likely to be (aOR=2.32, p=0.011) associated with good practice of prevention measures compared to adolescents who demonstrated negative attitudes.
Individuals from households in the fourth (aOR=0.40, p=0.018), middle (aOR=0.32, P=0.03), and second (aOR=0.44, p=0.035) wealth quintiles were less likely to use malaria prevention measures compared to those from households in the highest wealth quintile.
ConclusionThe study revealed that adolescents, generally have poor levels of malaria knowledge and low uptake of malaria prevention and control interventions.
Targeted interventions for high-risk adolescents are needed, that focus on improving their knowledge of the disease and effective preventive measures, and on increasing their access to health care services and LLINs.
Can womens reports in client exit interviews be used to measure and track progress of antenatal care quality?
Evidence from a facility assessment census in Malawi  IntroductionExit interviews given their shorter recall period unlike household surveys provides an opportunity to capture routine performance and level of service quality at the facility level.
However, very few studies exist validating whether womens reports in exit interviews can reliably be used to measure quality of care.
This study contributes to the sparse literature by examining the validity and reliability of womens report of selected antenatal care (ANC) interventions in the exit interviews in Malawi.
MethodsUsing the 2013-2014 Malawi service provision facility census, we compared womens reports at exit interviews of ANC received with reports through direct observation by a trained third-party.
Six indicators of ANC common in both direct observation and client exit tool were identified.
These include; whether provider prescribed or gave fansidar for malaria prevention; whether provider prescribed or gave iron and folic tablets; whether provider explained side effects of iron and folic tablets; whether provider discussed importance of good nutrition during pregnancy; whether provider discussed delivery preparation and whether provider discussed pregnancy related complications.
Indicators considered to have both high individual accuracy (an AUC value of 0.70 or greater) and low population-level bias (0.75<IF<1.25) were considered to have acceptable validity.
To measure agreement, we calculating Kappa coefficient ({kappa}) and the prevalence adjusted bias adjusted kappa (PABAK).
Both {kappa} and PABAK values were interpreted as follows: almost perfect (>0.80), substantial (0.61-0.80), moderate (0.41-0.60), fair (0.21-0.40), slight (0.00-0.20) and poor (<0.00).
Using chi-squared tests we also examined factors that are associated with high agreement between exit interview reports and direct observations.
Resultsfor both validity and agreement measures, our findings show that womens self-reports in the exit interviews presented overall higher accuracy and agreement for indicators related to concrete, observable interventions.
In contrast, indicators related to counselling or advice given, performed less reliably.
The results also show that age, primiparous status, number of antenatal visit and type of health provider were associated with high level of agreement.
While household survey programmes such as the DHS and MICS are frequently relied on as data sources for measuring intervention coverage, triangulation of such findings with other data sources such as client exit interviews is important.
Modelling the impact of interventions on imported, introduced and indigenous malaria infections in Zanzibar, Tanzania  Malaria cases can be classified as imported, introduced or indigenous cases.
The World Health Organization definition of malaria elimination requires an area to demonstrate no new indigenous cases have occurred in the last three years.
Here, we present a malaria transmission model that incorporates human mobility and distinguishes between imported, introduced and indigenous cases.
We test the impact of several interventions on Zanzibar such as reactive case detection, reactive drug administration, treating infected travellers, and transmission reduction on Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania.
We find that the majority of new cases on both major islands of Zanzibar are indigenous cases, despite high case importation rates.
Combinations of interventions that increase the number of infections treated through reactive case detection or reactive drug administration can lead to substantial decreases in malaria incidence, but for elimination within the next 40 years, transmission reduction in both Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania is necessary.
The clinical pharmacology of tafenoquine in the radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria: an individual patient data meta-analysis  BackgroundTafenoquine is a newly licensed antimalarial drug for the radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria.
MethodsWe pooled individual data from 1102 patients with acute vivax malaria and 72 healthy volunteers (all with >70% of the population median whole blood glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PD] activity) who were studied in the pre-registration trials of tafenoquine.
Plasma tafenoquine concentrations were analysed under a population pharmacokinetic model.
A series of Bayesian logistic and Emax dose-response models were fitted to the primary outcome of any P. vivax recurrence within 4 months.
Acute vomiting and haemolysis were secondary outcomes.
The key exposure variables were: the mg/kg tafenoquine dose; pharmacokinetic summaries of parent compound exposure (AUC[0,{infty}), Cmax) and metabolism (terminal elimination half-life); and day 7 methaemoglobin concentration (%) as a measure of oxidative activity.
ResultsTafenoquine dose (mg/kg) was a major determinant of recurrence (odds ratio [OR]: 0.70 per mg/kg increase, 95% credible interval [CI]: 0.65-0.75).
After adjustment for dose, the tafenoquine terminal elimination half-life (OR: 1.15 per day increase, 95% CI: 1.06-1.25), and the day 7 methaemoglobin concentration (OR: 0.81 per absolute percentage point increase, 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.99), but not the parent compound exposure, were also associated with recurrence.
Under the Emax we estimate that the currently recommended 300mg dose in a 60kg adult ({approx}5mg/kg) results in approximately 70% of the maximal obtainable hypnozoiticidal effect.
Increasing the dose to 7.5mg/kg (i.e.
450mg) would result in 90% reduction in the risk of P. vivax recurrence.
Tafenoquine was well tolerated.
No patients had severe haemolysis.
Acute vomiting was not dose-related.
In patients with normal G6PD enzyme concentrations, tafenoquine dose was associated with minor post-treatment haemoglobin reductions on days 2 or 3 (0.02 g/dL per mg/kg increase [95% CI: 0.04 to 0.00]).
Conclusions and interpretationThe currently recommended 300mg adult dose for radical cure of vivax malaria has suboptimal efficacy.
Increasing to 450mg is predicted to increase radical cure rates substantially.
The production of oxidative metabolites is central to tafenoquines hypnozoiticidal efficacy.
Clinical trials of higher tafenoquine doses are now needed to characterise efficacy, safety and tolerability.
Malaria; risk factors within urban and rural settings in the sahelian region of Cameroon and the role of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes.
BackgroundCameroon is among the 11 countries that account for 92 % of malaria infection in sub-Saharan-Africa in 2018, and Maroua III Health District and her environs witnessed a malaria outbreak in 2013 with hundreds of deaths.
This study was aimed at understanding the risk factors of malaria in the urban and rural population and to investigate the level of mosquitos resistance to Deltamethrin and Permethrin.
MethodsIt was a cross-sectional community-based study carried out from August to October 2019, in which questionnaires were administered to 500 participants, to obtain information on demographics, socioeconomic, behavioral, and environmental factors thought to be associated with malaria infection in both rural and urban settings.
Blood samples were collected for the diagnosis of malaria.
Logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for malaria.
Mosquito resistance to Deltamethrin and Permethrin were investigated using the CDC Bottle Bioassay test.
ResultsMalaria prevalence was 52.2%, which was significantly higher (p = 0.016) in rural areas (57.6%) as compared to urban areas (46.8%).
The overall prevalence of asymptomatic malaria parasitemia in the population was 43.4% in contrast to symptomatic malaria which was 8.8%.
In rural areas, risk factors were households using treated bed nets older than 3 years (AOR: 2.45 95% CI: 1.30 to 4.61 P-value: 0.006); households whose water source are unprotected wells (AOR: 3.04 95% CI: 1.21 to 7.64 P-value: 0.018).
In urban areas, risk factors were households surrounded by farmland with crops (AOR: 2.08 95% CI: 1.14 to 3.80 P-value 0.017) and households using treated bed nets older than 3 years (AOR: 2.70 95% CI: 1.52 to 4.78 P-value 0.001).
The age group 2-10years was significantly associated (p<0.001) with malaria in both rural and urban settings of the district.
The geometric mean parasite density was found to decrease with increasing age of participants in the entire health district.
The overall mortality of Anopheles species was 93.57% (91.19% in rural and 95.83% in urban areas) for deltamethrin, which was more sensitive than 83.85% (85.24% in rural and 82.46% in urban areas) for permethrin.
ConclusionRelevant data for malaria control in Maroua III health district, a typical Sahelian environment, has been generated, and indicates that most of the burden of malaria is borne by school children.
Deltamethrine was more effective than permethrine in the control of mosquito populations within these areas.
Seasonal Dynamics of Anopheles stephensi and its Implications for Mosquito Detection and Emergent Malaria Control in the Horn of Africa  Invasion of the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi across the Horn of Africa threatens control efforts across the continent, particularly in urban settings where the vector is able to proliferate.
Malaria transmission across Africa is primarily determined by the abundance of dominant vectors, which often varies seasonally with rainfall.
We collate longitudinal catch-data from across its endemic range to better understand the vectors seasonal dynamics and explore the implications of this seasonality for malaria surveillance and control across the Horn of Africa.
Our results show that timing entomological surveys to coincide with rainy periods is unlikely to improve the likelihood of detecting An.stephensi.
Integrating these results into a model of malaria transmission, we show that timing indoor residual spraying campaigns to coincide with peak rainfall offers little improvement in reducing disease burden compared to starting in a random month.
Our results suggest that unlike other major malaria vectors in Africa, rainfall may be a poor guide to predicting the timing of peaks in An.stephensi-driven malaria transmission.
This highlights the urgent need for longitudinal entomological monitoring of the vector in its new environments given recent invasion and potential spread across the continent.
Climate change impacts on Zika and dengue risk in four Brazilian cities: projections using a temperature-dependent basic reproduction number  For vectorborne diseases the basic reproduction number[R] 0, a measure of a diseases epidemic potential, is highly temperature dependent.
Recent work characterizing these temperature dependencies has highlighted how climate change may impact geographic disease spread.
We estimated a temperature-dependent[R] 0(T), derived from a compartmental transmission model, characterizing Zika (and, for comparison, dengue) transmission potential.
We obtained historical temperature data for the 5-year period 2015-2019 and projections for 2045-2049 by fitting cubic spline interpolations to data from simulated atmospheric data provided by the CMIP-6 project (specifically, generated by the GFDL-ESM4 model), which provides projections under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP).
Our model predicts that the[R] 0(T) for Zika peaks at 2.7 around 30{degrees}C, while for dengue it peaks at 6.8 around 31{degrees}C. We find that the epidemic potential of Zika and dengue will increase beyond current levels in Brazil in all of the climate scenarios.
For Manaus, we predict that the annual[R] 0 range will increase from 2.1-2.5, to 2.3-2.7, for Recife we project an increase from 0.4-1.9 to 0.6-2.3, for Rio de Janeiro from 0-1.9 to 0-2.3, and for Sao Paulo from 0-0.3 to 0-0.7.
As Zika immunity wanes and temperatures increase, there will be increasing epidemic potential and longer transmission seasons, especially in regions where transmission is currently marginal.
Surveillance systems should be implemented and sustained for early detection.
We used a temperature-dependent infectious disease transmission model to derive a temperature-dependent basic reproduction number.
We then used historical temperature data and temperature projections for the years 2045-2049 to forecast Zika risk in four cities in Brazil under various climate change scenarios.
We also found little-to-no protective effect of increasing temperatures even in warmer climates like Manaus.
Our results indicate that preparation for future Zika outbreaks (and of those of other arboviruses including dengue) should include the implementation of national disease surveillance and early detection systems.
Factors affecting trust in clinical trials conduct: Views of stakeholders from a qualitative study in Ghana  IntroductionGlobally, there are signs of declining public trust in science, especially in biomedical research.
In Ghana, there are equally signs of public distrust in the conduct of biomedical research in Ghana.
Typical examples are the unsuccessful conduct of the Ebola vaccine trial and the initial refusal of parents to allow their children to receive the recently piloted malaria vaccine in Ghana.
MethodsThis was a cross-sectional exploratory study using qualitative research approach.
Forty-eight in-depth interviews and Key informant interviews were conducted with stakeholders.
Purposive sampling technique was used to select participants.
All the interviews were recorded, transcribed and coded into main and sub-themes using QSR Nvivo 12 software to aid thematic analysis.
Implementation factors such as perceived risks about clinical trials medicines, apprehensions on drawing and use of blood samples, poor informed consent administration and perceived no illness all negatively affected trust in clinical trials conduct.
Coverage and factor associated to the uptake of Intermittent preventive treatment for malaria during pregnancy (IPTp) in Cameroun in 2018: an analysis from the 2018 Cameroon Demographic Health Survey data  Malaria in pregnancy is a major public health issue, contributing to significantly increasing mother and children mortality and morbidity.
Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria using Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) is one of the key interventions recommended by WHO and in Cameroon to reduce the morbidity of Malaria in Pregnancy.
The present study aims to assess the distribution and determinants of poor uptake of IPTp-SP (< 3 doses) among pregnant women in Cameroon.
Data were collected using a questionnaire administered in face to face to mothers with at least one child under 5, selected using a 2-stage stratified sampling process.
Frequencies of mothers exposed to less than 3 doses of IPTp-SP were estimated with a 95% CI.
A case-control design was used to assess the association between key suspected determinants and being exposed to less than 3 doses of IPTp-SP.
This was measured by estimating crude and adjusted Odd-Ratios (ORs).
A total of 13527 childbearing age women were interviewed, of which 5528 (40.9%) met our selection criteria.
Among those, 845 (15.3%) had not attended any Antenatal care (ANC) visit, 1109 (20%) had attended 1 to 3 visits, 3379 (61.1%) had attended 4 to 7 visits and only 195 (3.5%) had attended at least 8 visits.
In all, 3398 (61.5%, CI: 60.2-62.8) had received less than 3 doses of IPTp-SP.
Maternal age below 26 years (aOR=1.17, CI: 1.01-1.35), residence in an area of lower malaria endemicity (aOR=1.26, CI: 1.00-1.58), residence in the Sahelian regions (aOR=5.81, CI: 2.46-13.69), and having attended less than 4 ANC visits (aOR=1.30, CI: 1.08-1.57) were predictors of poor uptake of IPTp-SP.
Conversely, residence in major cities (aOR=0.65, CI: 0.50-0.84), having attended a first ANC visit at 3 months or less of pregnancy (aOR=0.66, CI: 0.57-0.78) and having been followed on ANC by a medical doctor (aOR=0.22, CI: 0.13-0.35), were preventing factors for poor uptake of IPTp3+.
Highest level of education (aOR= 1.10, CI: 0.90-1.32) was not found associated with the uptake of IPTp-SP.
Therefore, only a third of pregnant women in Cameroon take an optimal dose of IPTp-SP.
Interventions to address identified determinants of low coverage of IPTp-SP like maternal age below 26 years, ANC characteristics or being resident of area with lower malaria endemicity ought to be tested.
A systematic review of Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic fever virus in Sub-Sahara Africa, 1969-2022  ABSTRCTIn Sub-Saharan Africa, CCHFV has been reported in some of the countries with resultant seroprevalences ranging from 1.65-44%, 0.37-75%, 19-74% amongst humans, ticks and cattle respectively using ELISA technique.
Strains classified as Africa clade 1,2 and 3 have been established to be circulating in Sub-Saharan Africa from few molecular studies carried out.
CCHFV has part of its nomenclature rooted in Africa, however, the actual spread of the virus across sub-Saharan Africa is poorly known.
Most researches, which were quite limited, carried out across Africa were on antibody detection using ELISA methods with little information on molecular characterization.
The aim of this review is to harmonize the studies carried out in Sub-Saharan Africa on CCHFV between 1969 -2022 with respect to seroprevalence, viral identification and isolation, molecular characterization and genomic analysis.
Articles are retrieved from public databases such as google search, PubMed, Google scholar and ResearchGate, filtered using PRISMA concept and data extracted from eligible articles and analyzed.
In this study the overall average seroprevalence of CCHFV in Humans, Ticks, Cattle, sheep and Goats are 13.6%, 18.1%, 44.3%, 11.3%, 16.3% respectively.
South Africa has the highest seroprevalence (20.8%) among humans and Uganda (2.5%) has the lowest.
The prevalence of CCHFV in many African countries is still yet unknown though there is clear evidence of exposure of people within the region to CCHFV.
Limitations in sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic techniques such as agar gel precipitation test, haemagglutination test and complement fixation test used at some instance suggest a need for more reliable techniques.
Authors summaryCrimea-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus is carried by ticks.
It has a high fatality rate among humans.
It is implicated in haemorrhagic fever with bleeding through the nose and mouth.
CCHFV is fast spreading across the world but little is known it in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Many individuals in this region are herders, they are daily exposed to ticks; they regularly come down with febrile illnesses that are most times misdiagnosed as either malaria or typhoid.
In the course of treating for malaria or typhoid, some die.
There is no awareness ongoing in the communities about this infection and its danger to the population, preventive measures with respect to personal hygiene, cleanliness of the abattoirs and general environments and the need to seek medical attention and avoid self-medication.
In this review it is shown that there is evidence of spread of CCHFV in Sub-Saharan Africa, however, there is paucity of information.
This lack is as result of many factors such as lack of funds for research, porous security that makes it difficult tracing, lack of effective diagnosis of viral pathogens and so on.
Identifying a minimal set of single nucleotide polymorphisms to classify the geographic origin of a P. falciparum sample from the pf3k database  Genetic sequencing of malaria parasites has the potential to become an important tool in routine surveillance efforts for the control and eradication of malaria.
For example, characterizing the epidemiological connectivity between different populations by assessing the genetic similarity of their parasites can offer insights for national malaria control programs and their strategic allocation of interventions.
Despite the increase of whole-genome sequencing of malaria parasites, the development of a small set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), often referred to as a barcode, or a panel of amplicons remains programmatically relevant for large-scale, local generation of genetic data.
Here, we present an application of a machine-learning method to classify the geographic origin of a sample and identify a small set of region-specific SNPs.
We demonstrate that this method can automatically identify sets of SNPs which complement the currently targeted loci from the malaria scientific community.
More specifically, we find that many of these machine-learned SNPs are near known and well-studied loci such as regions and markers linked to drug resistance, while also identifying new areas of the genome where function is less characterized.
A Comparison of Changes in Venous Lactate and Haematocrit during Fluid Resuscitation of Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever  BackgroundDengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) causes significant morbidity and mortality.
Judicious fluid resuscitation is the cornerstone of managing vascular leakage in DHF and haematocrit (HCT) measurement is used to monitor the response to fluid resuscitation.
Serum lactate level is a measure of tissue perfusion which can be a useful parameter to monitor adequate fluid therapy.
The usefulness of lactate in the management of DHF is poorly investigated.
Methodology and Principal FindingsA prospective observational study was conducted in two treatment centers in Sri Lanka recruiting 162 DHF patients, to study the correlation of venous lactate and HCT during fluid resuscitation.
Patients were recruited within 12 hours of diagnosis of the critical phase and venous lactate level was measured at each time of performing HCT, using a pre-validated handheld lactate analyzer.
Median lactate level was 1.3 (range 0.3 - 6 mmol/L) in the study population and 154 (95.2%) patients had median lactate levels less than 2 mmol/L.
The HCT values in the study participants ranged from 28 to 62, with a median value of 43.
There was no statistically significant correlation between the lactate and HCT values obtained at the same time.
In addition, a statistically significant reduction in venous lactate was not observed following administration of fluid boluses.
However, HCT reduction expected by administration of the fluid boluses was seen following dextran and crystalloid/dextran combination.
Capillary HCT increased following blood transfusion.
The highest lactate level measured in a patient was associated with an increase in hospital stay.
ConclusionsThis study concludes that venous lactate is not an appropriate parameter to monitor response to fluid therapy in uncomplicated DHF.
Author SummaryDengue viral infection causes asymptomatic disease to severe haemorrhagic fever causing organ failure and death.
Severe manifestations occur due to fluid extravasation during the critical phase of the illness and these patients with dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) require close monitoring and guided fluid therapy.
Adequacy of fluid resuscitation is guided by capillary haematocrit (HCT) measurement.
However, HCT does not reflect the tissue perfusion.
Venous lactate is a reliable measure of tissue perfusion is circulatory collapse.
Lactate is known to be a useful marker in identifying severe dengue disease.
The usefulness of venous lactate to predict tissue perfusion during fluid resuscitation of DHF has not been performed.
The present study was done to identify the usefulness of venous lactate measured by a hand-held lactate analyser in fluid resuscitation of DHF and to find the correlation of HCT and lactate values.
Results revealed that uncomplicated DHF patients did not have significantly elevated lactate levels and the HCT and lactate levels performed at the same time did not correlate.
Highest lactate level measured in a patient was associated with a longer hospital stay.
Therefore, venous lactate is not an appropriate marker to guide fluid therapy in uncomplicated DHF.
Spatial Dynamics of Malaria Transmission  The Ross-Macdonald model has exerted enormous influence over the study of malaria transmission dynamics and control, but it lacked features to describe parasite dispersal, travel, and other important aspects of heterogeneous transmission.
Here, we present a patch-based differential equation modeling framework that extends the Ross-Macdonald model with sufficient skill and complexity to support planning, monitoring and evaluation for Plasmodium falciparum malaria control.
We designed a generic interface for building structured, spatial models of malaria transmission based on a new algorithm for mosquito blood feeding.
The core dynamical components describing mosquito ecology and malaria transmission were decomposed, redesigned and reassembled into a modular framework.
Structural elements in the framework - human population strata, patches, and aquatic habitats - interact through a flexible design that facilitates construction of ensembles of models with scalable complexity to support robust analytics for malaria policy and adaptive malaria control.
We propose updated definitions for the human biting rate and entomological inoculation rates.
We present new formulas to describe parasite dispersal and spatial dynamics under steady state conditions, including the human biting rates, parasite dispersal, the "vectorial capacity matrix," a human transmitting capacity distribution matrix, and threshold conditions.
An R package that implements the framework, solves the differential equations, and computes spatial metrics for models developed in this framework has been developed.
Development of the model and metrics have focused on malaria, but since the framework is modular, the same ideas and software can be applied to other mosquito-borne pathogen systems.
Author summaryThe Ross-Macdonald model, a simple mathematical model of malaria transmission based on the parasite life-cycle, established basic theory and a set of metrics to describe and measure transmission.
Here, we extend the Ross-Macdonald model so it has the skill to study, simulate, and analyze parasite dispersal and heterogeneous malaria spatial transmission dynamics in a defined geographical area with malaria importation.
Heterogeneity in human epidemiology or behaviors - differences in age, immunity, travel, mobility, care seeking, vaccine status, bed net use, or any trait affecting transmission - can be handled by stratifying populations.
Mosquito spatial ecology and behaviors are responding to heterogeneous resource availability and weather, which affects adult mosquito dispersal, blood feeding, and egg laying in a structured set of aquatic habitats.
We propose new formulas for human biting rates and entomological inoculation rates that integrate exposure as humans move around.
We rigorously define parasite dispersal, and we develop matrices describing the spatial dimensions of vectorial capacity and parasite dispersal in mobile humans.
We relate these to the parasites overall reproductive success, local reproductive numbers and thresholds for endemic transmission.
The prevalence and factors associated with premature birth among post-delivery women in the Mbeya region: An analytical cross-sectional study  In Tanzania, there was an increase of prematurity rate from 11.4% in 2014 up to 16.60% in 2016 (1).
This is a hospital based analytical cross-sectional study which involved biopsychosocial model, which focused on identifying prevalence and associated factors for preterm births among post-delivery women in Mbeya region, one of Tanzania regions.
This study involved hospitals in Mbeya urban, Mbeya rural, Chunya, Kyela, Mbarali, Rungwe, Busokelo and Tukuyu districts, where the prevalence of preterm births in Mbeya found to be 39.1%.
The study pointed out that factors associated with preterm births were child spacing of <24months (AOR=3.058; 95% CI = 1.026-9.116: p-value 0.045), non-effective use of malaria prophylaxis during pregnancy (AOR=5.418; 95% CI =1.
p-value 0.008), twin pregnancy (AOR=4.657; 95% CI =2.112-10.223, p-value < 0.001), violence during pregnancy (AOR=2.059; p-value 0.048), lack of social support (AOR=1.993; p-value 0.022) and use of pica during pregnancy (AOR=1.880; p-value 0.029).
The study outcome revealed that the prevalence of preterm births in Mbeya Region is even higher.
Therefore, to minimize or eliminate the problem a deliberate effort to come up with strategies to improve family planning, applications of antimalaria prophylaxis, stop the use of pica and violence during pregnancy was highly recommended.
Using qPCR to compare the detection of Plasmodium vivax oocysts and sporozoites in Anopheles farauti mosquitoes between two DNA extraction methods  BackgroundCurrently, the gold standard to assess parasite developmental stages in mosquitoes is light microscopy.
Microscopy can miss low-density infections, is time-consuming and not species-specific.
This can place limitations on studies, especially when the infection status of larger mosquito populations is important and studies are done in co-endemic settings with multiple circulating parasite species.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been the alternative technique to evaluate the infectivity of mosquitoes especially in field studies however it is semi-quantitative.
Molecular techniques that have been used to detect the mosquito stages of malaria parasites including P. vivax.
Here, we present a quantitative real-time assay (qPCR) assay that can be used to detect low-density P. vivax oocyst and sporozoite infections.
Parasite detection via qPCR after performing the conventional DNA extraction versus direct qPCR following heating of the infected mosquito samples was compared.
MethodsColony reared Anopheles farauti mosquitoes were exposed to blood samples collected from infected individuals using a direct membrane feeding assay.
The fully fed mosquitoes were kept for 7 and 14 days post-feed before dissection to confirm presence of oocysts and sporozoites.
Infected mosquito guts and the salivary glands (with the head and thorax) were stored and DNA was extracted either by heating or by performing conventional column-based DNA extraction.
Following DNA extraction the infected samples were subjected to qPCR to detect P. vivax parasites.
ResultsDNA extraction of 1 or more oocysts by heating resulted in an overall sensitivity of 78% (57/73) and single oocysts infections were detected with a sensitivity of 82% (15/17) in the heating arm as well.
We observed a 60% (18/30) sensitivity with sporozoites where DNA was extracted using the conventional DNA extraction method prior to qPCR diagnosis.
We show that the heating method significantly improved the detection of oocysts over conventional DNA extraction.
There was no significant difference in the DNA copy numbers when comparing the detection of oocysts from the conventional DNA extraction versus heating.
There was also no significant difference in the detection rate of sporozoite samples when comparing the two DNA extraction protocols.
However, we observed that the DNA copy numbers of the sporozoites detected in the heating arm was significantly higher than in the conventional DNA extraction arm.
ConclusionWe have adapted a qPCR assay which, when coupled with heating to release DNA reduces sample processing time and cost.
Direct qPCR after heating will be a useful tool when investigating transmission blocking vaccines or antimalarials or when evaluating field caught mosquitoes for the presence of malaria parasites.
Plasmodium vivax relapse, reinfection and recrudescence estimation using genetic data  Malaria is a major public health concern.
Among the two most important causes of human malaria, Plasmodium vivax is the hardest to eliminate, owing largely to its ability to relapse (cause recurrent blood-stage infection following the activation of dormant liver-stage parasites called hypnozoites).
Recurrent vivax malaria can also follow a failure to treat a preceding blood-stage infection (recrudescence) and, in endemic settings, a new infectious mosquito bite (reinfection).
Understanding the cause of recurrent vivax malaria is critical for disease control efforts, e.g., to estimate the efficacy of a hypnozoiticidal drug, relapse needs to be separated from reinfection and recrudescence.
In this report we describe the Pv3R statistical model designed to estimate using P. vivax genetic data the probability that a recurrent P. vivax blood-stage infection is a relapse, reinfection or recrudescence (the Pv 3Rs).

A lightweight, automated neural network-based stage-specific malaria detection software using dimension reduction: The malaria stage classifier  Due to climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of malaria cases and deaths increased between 2019 and 2020 [1].
Reversing this trend and eliminating malaria worldwide requires improvements in malaria diagnosis, in which artificial intelligence (AI) has recently been demonstrated to have a great potential.
Here, we describe an AI-based approach that boosts the performance of light (LM), atomic force (AFM) and fluorescence microscopy (FM)-based malaria diagnosis.
As the main challenge, the stage-specific recognition of infected red blood cells (RBCs) usually requires large sets of microscopy images for training a neural network, which is difficult to obtain.
Our tool, the Malaria Stage Classifier, provides a fast, high-accuracy recognition that works even with limited training sets due to a smart reduction of data dimension.
Individual RBCs are extracted from an image, reduced to characteristic one-dimensional cross-sections, and classified.
Author summaryThe Malaria Stage Classifier is a software helping the user to detect and stage RBCs infected with malaria.
Accurate recognition of malaria infected RBCs still imposes a challenge in endemic regions, as it is time-consuming and subjective.
These deficiencies can be overcome by autonomous computer assisted recognition using neural networks (NNs).
The Malaria Stage Classifier offers a user-friendly interface for the stage-specific classification of malaria infected RBCs into four categories--healthy ones and three classes of infected ones according to the parasite age.
The use of data reduction, which forms the central element of the Malaria Stage Classifier, allows for a fast and accurate classification of RBCs.
It is applicable for light, atomic force, and fluorescence microscopy images and allows for retraining the implemented NN with new images.
No association between the Plasmodium vivax crt-o MS334 or In9pvcrt polymorphisms and chloroquine failure in a clinical cohort from Malaysia  Increasing reports of resistance to a frontline malaria blood-stage treatment, chloroquine (CQ), raise concerns for the elimination of Plasmodium vivax.
The absence of an effective molecular marker of CQ resistance in P. vivax greatly constrains surveillance of this emerging threat.
A recent genetic cross between CQ sensitive (CQS) and CQ resistant (CQR) NIH-1993 strains of P. vivax linked a moderate CQR phenotype with two candidate markers in P. vivax CQ resistance transporter gene (pvcrt-o): MS334 and In9pvcrt.
A recent genetic cross between CQ sensitive (CQS) and CQ resistant (CQR) NIH-1993 strains of P. vivax linked a moderate CQR phenotype with two candidate markers in P. vivax CQ resistance transporter gene (pvcrt-o): MS334 and In9pvcrt.
A recent genetic cross between CQ sensitive (CQS) and CQ resistant (CQR) NIH-1993 strains of P. vivax linked a moderate CQR phenotype with two candidate markers in P. vivax CQ resistance transporter gene (pvcrt-o): MS334 and In9pvcrt.
Longer TGAAGH motifs at MS334 were associated with CQ resistance, as were shorter motifs at the In9pvcrt locus.
In this study, high-grade CQR clinical isolates of P. vivax from Malaysia were used to investigate the association between the MS334 and In9pvcrt variants and treatment efficacy.
Amongst a total of 49 independent monoclonal P. vivax isolates assessed, high-quality MS334 and In9pvcrt sequences could be derived from 30 (61%) and 23 (47%), respectively.
Five MS334 and six In9pvcrt alleles were observed, with allele frequencies ranging from 2 to 76% and 3 to 71%, respectively.
None of the clinical isolates had the same variant as the NIH-1993 CQR strain, and none were associated with CQ treatment failure (all p>0.05).
Our findings suggest that the pvcrt-o MS334 and In9pvcrt markers cannot be used universally as markers of CQ treatment efficacy in an area of high-grade CQ resistance.
Further studies applying hypothesis-free genome-wide approaches are warranted to identify more effective CQR markers for P. vivax.
Monkeypox Post COVID19: Knowledge, Worrying, and Vaccine Adoption of the Arabic General Population  BackgroundThe outbreak of monkeypox was designated a global public health emergency by the World Health Organization on July 23, 2022.
There have been more reported 60000 cases worldwide, most of which are in places where monkeypox has never been seen due to the travel of people who have the virus.
This research aims to evaluate the Arabic general population on monkeypox disease, fears, and vaccine adoption after the WHO proclaimed a monkeypox epidemic and to compare these attitudes to those of the COVID-19 pandemic.
MethodsThis cross-sectional study was performed in some Arabic countries (Syria, Egypt, Qatar, Yemen, Jordan, Sudan, Algeria, and Iraq) between August 18 and September 7, 2022 to examine the Arabic people perspectives on monkeypox disease, fears, and vaccine adoption and to compare these attitudes to those of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The inclusion criteria were the general public residing in Arabic nations and older than 18.
The second portion assesses knowledge and anxieties about monkeypox, while the third section includes the generalized anxiety disorder (GAD7) scale.
Logistic regression analysis were performed to compute the adjusted odds ratios (aOR), and their confidence intervals (95%CI) using STATA (version 17.0)  ResultsA total of 3665 respondents from 17 Arabic countries were involved in this study.
Almost two third (n= 2427, 66.2%) of participants expressed more worried about COVID -19 than monkeypox diseases.
Regarding the major cause for concern about monkeypox, 39.5% of participants attributed their anxiety they or a member of their family may contract the illness, while 38.4% were concerned about another worldwide pandemic of monkeypox.
According to the GAD 7 score, 71.7% of respondents showed very low anxiety toward monkeypox.
43.8% of the participants scored poor levels of knowledge about monkeypox disease.
Participants with previous COVID-19 infection showed greater acceptance to receive the monkeypox vaccine 1.206 times than those with no previous infection.
A higher concern for the monkeypox than COVID-19 was shown by the participants who perceived monkeypox as dangerous and virulent 3.097 times than those who didnt.
Participants who have a chronic disease (aOR: 1.32; 95%CI: 1.09-1.60); participants worried about monkeypox (aOR: 1.21; 95%CI: 1.04-1.40); and perceived monkeypox as a dangerous and virulent disease (aOR: 2.25; 95%CI: 1.92-2.65); and excellent knowledge level (aOR: 2.28; 95%CI: 1.79-2.90) have emerged as significant predictors.
ConclusionOur study reported that three fourth of the participants were more concerned about COVID-19 than monkeypox disease.
As well, most of the participants have inadequate levels of knowledge regarding monkeypox disease.
Consequently, it is crucial to learn about monkeypox and spread information about its prevention.
Altitude, not potential larval habitat availability, explains pronounced variation in Plasmodium falciparum infection prevalence in the western Kenya highlands  BackgroundProgress in malaria control has stalled over the recent years.
MethodsWe collected finger-prick blood samples from 3061 individuals irrespective of clinical symptoms in 20 clusters in Busia in western Kenya and screened for Plasmodium falciparum parasites using qPCR and microscopy.
Clusters spanned an altitude range of 207 meters (1077-1284 m).
We mapped potential mosquito larval habitats and determined their number within 250 m of a household and distances to households using ArcMap.
ResultsAcross all clusters, P. falciparum parasites were detected in 49.8% (1524/3061) of individuals by qPCR and 19.5% (596/3061) by microscopy.
Across the clusters, prevalence ranged from 26% to 70% by qPCR.
Three to 34 larval habitats per cluster and 0-17 habitats within a 250m radius around households were observed.
Using a generalized linear mixed effect model (GLMM), a 5% decrease in the odds of getting infected per each 10m increase in altitude was observed, while the number of larval habitats and their proximity to households were not statistically significant predictors for prevalence.
Kitchen located indoors, open eaves, a lower level of education of the household head, older age, and being male were significantly associated with higher prevalence.
ConclusionPronounced variation in prevalence at small scales was observed and needs to be taken into account for malaria surveillance and control.
Estimating the malaria attributable fraction of fever in cohort studies through a before and after comparison of impact: Nagongera, Tororo, Uganda, 2011-2019  AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSMalaria is an important cause of fever across much of sub-Saharan Africa and other places where Plasmodium falciparum infection is highly prevalent.
Here, we estimate the fraction of fever that is attributable to malaria using data from two studies in Nagongera, Tororo, Uganda that followed cohorts of children and adults longitudinally from 2011-2019.
The study included three years before and five years after indoor residual spraying (IRS) sharply reduced mosquito populations, malaria exposure, and the prevalence of malaria infection.
MethodsWe estimate the malaria attributable fraction of fever (MAFF) by directly quantifying and comparing fever before and after IRS started.
We compared subjective (i.e., self-reported) and objective fever during scheduled and unscheduled visits (i.e., to seek care) in young children (under 5 years old), older children (aged 5-10 years), and adults (over 18 years old).
ResultsWe estimated that there were 78-90 total days per person, per year (pppy) with subjective fever during the pre-IRS baseline in young children; 52-58 in older children; and 38-46 days in adults.
After IRS, sub-clinical fever declined to 5-6 days pppy with fever in young children to around 3 in older children, and around 1 in adults: a 94% reduction in young children, 95% in older children, and 99% in adults.
Reductions in total fever prevalence for care seeking (during unscheduled visits) declined by around 50% in young children, 65% in older children, and 80% in adults.
In the before vs. after comparison, malaria accounted for 88% of objective fever during scheduled visits in young children, 75% in older children, and 91% in adults.
Total fever declined by 80-85% in children and 90-93% in adults.
During care seeking, malaria accounted for around 44% of objective fever in young children, but no meaningful differences were observed at other ages.
These patterns were accompanied by changes in care seeking and total fever.
Over the first few months of the study, care seeking rates increased in all groups, but then care seeking rates started a decline that continued until the study ended.
By the end of the study, care seeking rates had declined by more than 75% overall compared with the start.
ConclusionsThe fraction attributed to malaria differed by age and context.
In this study population with good access to care, fever was rare at the end of the study in the absence of malaria.
Based on the before vs. after comparison, malaria was directly or indirectly responsible for most subjective fever in the clinical setting, and it was also the dominant cause of objective fever.
Surprisingly, a large fraction of subjective fever that occurred before IRS, during both scheduled and unscheduled visits, occurred in people who tested negative for malaria.
The study draws attention to the importance of sub-clinical disease as a contributor to the burden of health in malaria endemic settings.

Exploring barriers to seeking treatment for human African trypanosomiasis due to T.b.
rhodesiense in communities around Vwaza Marsh Wildlife Reserve in Rumphi and Mzimba Districts, northern Malawi  BackgroundRhodesiense human African trypanosomiasis (r-HAT) remains a public health problem in Malawi, with the country reporting the highest number of cases of this acute form of sleeping sickness in the East African endemic region in 2019 and 2020.
This paper explores the bottlenecks to seeking health care among patients with r-HAT around the Vwaza Marsh Wildlife Reserve (VMWR) in Rumphi and Mzimba districts in northern Malawi.
Methodology/Principal FindingsThis qualitative study used key informant interviews (KIIs), in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) to collect data.
Study participants included health care workers, current and past r-HAT patients and their guardians, community leaders and traditional healers.
All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.
Content analysis was performed with NVIVO.
Since r-HAT has similar signs and symptoms to malaria, patients either self-medicate or are prescribed antimalarial treatment, delaying the initiation of r-HAT treatment.
While diagnosis of r-HAT can be done at health centre level, treatment requires hospitalization at the district hospital situated 60 kilometers away.
Due to high levels of poverty, patients struggle to afford transport to the district hospital and their upkeep during hospitalization; patients and their guardians explained how they sold their property to fund this.
In addition, patients fear undergoing very painful diagnostic lumbar puncture, which is very painful.
Belief that r-HAT is caused by witchcraft still prevails, which also delays initiation of treatment.
The delivery of r-HAT services is also affected by the transfer of trained health workers to other locations.
Conclusions/SignificanceAccess to r-HAT services, including treatment, could improve if community members were sensitized about the causes, signs and symptoms of the disease, and the fact that it can be effectively treated at hospital but not by traditional healers.
Provision of treatment for r-HAT by health facilities around the VMWR would eliminate transport costs for patients and their guardians.
Author SummarySince 2019, Malawi has reported the highest numbers of cases of rhodesiense human African trypanosomiasis.
This study found that patients and their families experience many challenges in seeking health care: the disease is misdiagnosed as malaria, leading to patients receiving the wrong treatment and late initiation of the right treatment; beliefs in witchcraft cause delays as patients seek treatment from traditional healers; high levels of poverty mean that patients struggle to fund transport to the district hospital, the only facility currently providing treatment, and their upkeep during periods of hospitalization; fear of undergoing the very painful diagnostic lumbar puncture; and the transfer of well-trained health workers away from the area.
Patients should also be able to access treatment at the nearby health facilities rather than the district hospital, which is situated a long way from the community.
Effect of human mobility in Dengue spreading: Study cases for Caldas (CO).
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), dengue is the most common acute arthropod-borne viral infection in the world.
The spread of dengue and other infectious diseases is closely related to human activity and mobility.
In this paper we analyze the effect on the total number of dengue cases within a population after introducing mobility restrictions as a public health policy.
To perform the analysis, we use a complex metapopulation in which we implement a compartmental propagation model coupled with the mobility of individuals between the patches.
This model is used to investigate the spread of dengue in the municipalities of Caldas (CO).
In the first scenario, the effect of restricting mobility is analyzed in three different ways: a) limiting the access to the endemic node but allowing the movement of its inhabitants, b) restricting the diaspora of the inhabitants of the endemic node but allowing the access of outsiders, and c) a total isolation of the inhabitants of the endemic node.
In this scenario, the best simulation results are obtained when endemic nodes are isolated during a dengue outbreak, obtaining a reduction of up to 22.51% of dengue cases.
We have found that this control measure reduces the number of total dengue cases in the network by up to 42.67%.
Author summaryFor the World Health Organization, dengue is a disease of public health concern.
In recent years there is an increasing trend in the number of dengue cases despite existing prevention and control campaigns.
The mobility of the population is considered an important factor in dengue dispersion.
In this paper, we are interested in addressing how restrictions to human mobility might affect the incidence of dengue in a region.
Electronic data review, client reminders, and expanded clinic hours for improving cervical cancer screening rates after COVID19 pandemic shutdowns: a multi-component quality improvement program  ObjectiveTo improve cervical cancer screening (CCS) rates, the East Boston Neighborhood Health Center (EBNHC) implemented a Quality Improvement (QI) initiative from March to August 2021.
MethodsStaff training was provided.
A 21-provider team validated overdue CCS indicated by electronic medical record data.
To improve screening, CCS-only sessions were created during regular clinic hours (n=5) and weekends/evenings (n=8).
Results6126 charts were reviewed.
Of the list of overdue patients, outreach was performed to 1375 patients to schedule the 13 sessions.
A total of 459 (33%) of patients completed screening, 622 (45%) could not be reached, and 203 (15%) canceled or missed appointments.
The proportion of total active patients who were up to date with CCS increased from 68% in March to 73% in August 2021.
Survey results indicated high patient satisfaction, and only 42% of patients would have scheduled CCS without outreach.
ConclusionsThe creation of a validated patient chart list and extra clinical sessions devoted entirely to CCS improved up-to-date CCS rates.
This information can be used by other community health centers to optimize clinical workflows for CCS.
Applications of artificial intelligence in predicting dengue outbreaks in the face of climate change: a case study along coastal India.
Climate-sensitive diseases can serve as critical case studies for assessing public health priorities in the face of epidemics.
Preliminary results denote that machine learning-based predictive modeling measures can be successfully applied to understanding environmental disease transmission dynamics.
Ultimately, machine learning models can be trained to detect climate-sensitive diseases early, diseases which might represent serious threats to human health, food safety, and economies.
We explore how machine learning can serve as a tool for better understanding climate-sensitive diseases, taking dengue dynamics along the Godavari River of coastal India as our case study.
We hypothesize that a climate-driven predictive model with controlled calibration can help us understand several of the most critical relationships and climate characteristics of climate-sensitive disease dynamics.
Field assessment of the burden and determinants of malaria transmission to inform tailoring of interventions (microstratification) in Ibadan and Kano metropolis: Study protocol  IntroductionRapid urbanization in Nigerian cities may likely result in small-scale variation in malaria transmission with a higher malaria burden in informal settlements and slums.
We are conducting field studies to understand how malaria risk varies at the smallest administrative units (wards) in two major Nigerian cities - Ibadan and Kano - to inform tailoring of interventions for cities in Nigerias National Malaria Strategic Plan.
Methods and AnalysisThis is a mixed-method research design involving qualitative and quantitative research methods.
Cross-sectional surveys will be conducted in the wet and dry seasons across wards in the study cities and within different settlement types at the household and health facility levels to map all-age and under-five malaria prevalence and evaluate related risk factors.
A 12-month longitudinal study among children under the age of 10 years will provide information on malaria seasonality in the two cities and related factors.
Entomological surveys will be used to undertaken for eight months (four months in each season) per city to assess local transmission risk in both cities.
Descriptive and regression analysis will be applied to study data to assess malaria prevalence, seasonality and related factors.
Mathematical models of malaria transmission for each study ward will be developed based on study data to inform assessment of the impact of various intervention scenarios specified by the NMEP on malaria transmission.

A cross-sectional study on knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) and risk factors for dengue seropositivity among children in Fortaleza, Brazil.
BackgroundDengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease that is associated with four serotypes of the dengue virus.
Children are vulnerable to infection with the dengue virus and the risk of severe dengue disease is the highest among infants and children, particularly those who have been previously infected with a different dengue serotype.
Sufficient knowledge, positive attitudes, and proper practices (KAP) are essential for dengue prevention and control.
This study aims to estimate the dengue seropositivity for study participants and to examine the association between households dengue-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP), and childrens risk of dengue seropositivity, while accounting for socioeconomic and demographic differences in Brazil.
Methodology/Principal FindingsThis analysis was based on a cross-sectional study from Fortaleza, Brazil between November 2019, and February 2020.
There were 392 households and 483 participant children who provided a sample of sufficient quality for serological analysis.
The main exposure was a households dengue-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices, assessed through a questionnaire to construct a composite KAP score categorized into three levels: low, moderate and high.
The main outcome is dengue immunoglobulin G(IgG) antibodies, collected using dried blood spots and assessed with Panbio Dengue IgG indirect ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) test commercial kits.
The estimated crude dengue seroprevalence among participating children (n=483) was 25.1%.
5% (n=20) of households achieved a score of over 75% for KAP, while most households achieved between 50% and 75% of the total scores (n=271, 69%), and 101 households scored lower than 50% of the total score (26%).
Each KAP domain was significantly and positively associated with the others.
We found high household KAP scores were associated with an increased risk of seropositivity (RR: 2.08, 95% CI: 1.09-3.97, p=0.027).
Household adult respondents education level of elementary school or higher was negatively associated with childrens relative risk of being seropositive (RR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.49-0.87, p=0.004).
The risk of seropositivity in older children (6-12 years old) was over 6 times that of younger children (2-5 years old) (RR: 6.15, 95% CI: 3.51-10.76, p<0.001).
Children living in households with sealed water tanks or no water storage had a lower relative risk of being seropositive (RR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55-0.99, p=0.041).
Conclusions/SignificanceOur results provide insight into the prevalence of dengue seropositivity in Fortaleza, Brazil in children, and certain demographic and socioeconomic characteristics associated with childrens risk of being seropositive.
They also suggest that KAP may not identify those more at risk for dengue, although understanding and enhancing households KAP is crucial for effective community dengue control and prevention initiatives.
Author summaryDengue fever has become an increasing threat to public health, with its global expansion and increased presence in dengue endemic countries.
This study provides insight into the prevalence of dengue seropositivity in children in Fortaleza, Brazil, a city which has been a hotspot for arbovirus infections.
We estimated seroprevalence for certain study population characteristics and identified characteristics that were associated with an increased risk of dengue seropositivity.
We also explored the associations of a composite measure of knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) with seropositivity and found an inverse relationship between KAP for dengue control and childrens seropositivity.
KAP could change due to previous infection experience, which is a potential limitation of using KAP as a potential predictor of dengue seropositivity in cross-sectional studies.
Despite this, KAP remains useful for identifying gaps in knowledge, attitude, and practice that can be used to inform public health measures, such as education campaigns.
Measures of social acceptability of interventions should also be considered for inclusion in similar studies, as it would provide an indication of likelihood of adoption of interventions, which provides additional insight for different dengue interventions.
Human biting activity, resting behavior and yellow fever virus transmission potential of Aedes mosquitoes in southwest Ethiopia  BackgroundYellow fever is an emerging and re-emerging viral disease transmitted through the bites of infective Aedes mosquitoes.
Several outbreaks of yellow fever have been documented in southern Ethiopia.Understanding the transmission cycle is pivotal to manage arboviral disease outbreaks.
Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate which species of Aedes mosquitoes contribute to the YF virus transmission and the outbreaks that have occurred, and their behaviors (biting and resting) in the region.
MethodsTwo districts were selected based on previous Yellow Fever (YF) outbreak history.
A longitudinal entomological sampling was carried out to collect adult Aedes mosquitoes using human landing catches, mechanical mouth aspirators and pyrethrum spreadsheet collection.
Adult mosquito collections were conducted twice a month for six months from February 2019 to July 2020.
Identification of mosquito species at the genus level was done using morphological keys and speciation using molecular techniques.
Aedes mosquitoes were pooled and tested for YFV, dengue virus (DENV, serotype 1-4) and chikungunya virus (CHKV) by qPCR.
Principal findingsA total of 1582 Aedes mosquitoes were collected; 669 (42.3%) from Boko Dawula and 913 (57.7%) from Ofa district.
Of the 406 Aedes mosquitoes molecularly characterized to the species level, the Aedes simpsoni complex accounted for 99.5% (404/406), while Aedes aegypti found in the Ofa district accounted for only 0.5% (2/ 406).
From the 934 Aedes simpsoni tested for viruses and none were positive.
The human biting activities of Aedes (Ae.)
simpsoni peaked at 8:00 - 9:00 hour and 16:00 - 17:00 hour, mostly outdoors, both within the villages and forests.
The leaves of Ensete (E.) ventricosum appear to be ideal resting places for Aedes (Ae.)
simpsoni complex was negative for arboviruses; morning and afternoon activities of the species coincide with human outdoor activities and may therefore pose the risk of viral infection.
The lower dominance of Aedes aegypti indicated that the major responsible vector for the occurrences of previous and current arboviral diseases was due to other mentioned Aedes species.
It is of great importance to improve surveillance activities of arboviruses in reservoir hosts and vectors to establish control measures.
Furthermore, the origin of bloodmeal and the mosquitos role in the transmission of arboviral diseases need further study to improve the understanding of this species.
Author SummaryAedes mosquitoes are the vector of most arboviruses infecting humans and animals.
In Ethiopia, yellow fever (YF) outbreak is frequently occurring and claiming the lives of several people.
Therefore, understanding the cycle of transmission is crucial in designing the prevention and control strategies for YF outbreaks.
We conducted an entomological sampling in two districts with recent YF outbreaks in southwestern Ethiopia to identify and characterize the behavior and ecology of the Aedes mosquito species playing role in transmission.
simpsoni complex was the predominant species identified in both study areas and tends to bite humans in the morning and afternoon when most people are active outdoors within the villages and forests.
Although none of the tested Ae.
simpsoni complex mosquitoes were positive for arboviruses, improving surveillance activities in reservoir hosts, including primates and vectors, could be a key to establishing prevention and control strategies.
Challenges in the distribution of antimicrobial medications in community dispensaries in Accra, Ghana  IntroductionCommunity distribution of medications in low- and middle-income countries has been shown to accelerate the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.
The distribution of medications is often carried out by private vendors operating under constrained conditions.
The aim of this study was to illuminate the challenges reported by employees of chemical shops and pharmacies throughout Accra.
Our objectives are twofold: to 1) assess obstacles and challenges faced by medicine vendors during their sales of antibiotic and antimalarial medications, and 2) identify opportunities for improving community-level stewardship of antimicrobials.
MethodsResponses to open-ended questions from a survey of 80 shopkeepers in pharmacies and chemical shops throughout Accra were analyzed using the socioecological model of public health.
ResultsOverall, shopkeepers most often reported constraints at the interpersonal and community levels of the socioecological model of public health.
These included the prohibitive costs of medicines, customer attitudes, and customers attempts at self-medication and uninformed antimicrobial use.
DiscussionThe safe and effective distribution of medications was truncated by three main sources of obstacles: financial insecurity among customers, challenges directly in the treatment of illnesses, and broader issues with the fragmented healthcare infrastructure affecting shopkeepers roles as health educators and gatekeepers of medicines.
ConclusionThese context-specific findings identify tractable challenges faced by medicine vendors in Ghana, with relevance to antimicrobial stewardship across resource-poor settings globally.
Addressing barriers faced by shopkeepers would provide an opportunity for significantly improving the provision of medications, and ultimately healthcare, at the community level.
Piloting a pragmatic clinical audit tool for quality improvement in rural paediatric care in northern Sierra Leone  Hospital admissions and their clinical outcomes can reflect the disease burden in a population and can be utilised as effective surveillance and impact monitoring tools.
Inadequate documentation of admissions and their outcomes have contributed to the poor quality of paediatric care in many health care settings in sub-Saharan Africa.
We have developed and piloted a simple tool for documentation of basic, standardised patient-level information on causes of admissions, diagnoses, treatments and outcomes in patients admitted to the paediatric ward of a district hospital in a rural community in Sierra Leone.
From 1 August 2019 to 31 July 2021, we used this tool to document the admissions, treatments and clinical outcomes of 1,663 children admitted to this hospital.
The majority of the children (1015, 62%) were aged between 12-59 months, were boys (942, 57%), were wasted (516, 31%), stunted (238 14%) or underweight (537, 32%).
More than half of the children lived more than 1 km distance from the hospital (876/1410, 62%).
Most were admitted before 4pm (1171/1626, 72%) and during weekdays (1231/1662, 74%).
The highest number of paediatric admissions occurred in November 2019 and the lowest in April 2020.
Severe malaria was the leading cause of admission.
More than 80% of the children were successfully treated and discharged home (1356/1663, 81.5%) while 122/1663 (7.3%) died.
Children aged under-five years who were underweight, and those who presented with danger signs (e.g.
signs of breathing difficulty, dehydration, head injury or severe infections) had a higher risk of death than children without these features (p<0.01; p=0.03; p=0.011 and p= 0.009, respectively).
Lack of systematic documentation of medical histories and poor record keeping of hospital admissions and outcomes can be overcome by using a simple tool.
Continuous use of the tool with regular audits could improve delivery of paediatric care in resource-limited settings.
An economic evaluation of Wolbachia deployments for dengue control in Vietnam  BackgroundDengue is a major public health challenge and a growing problem due to climate change.
The release of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with the intracellular bacterium Wolbachia is a novel form of vector control against dengue.
In this paper, we evaluate the potential economic impact and cost-effectiveness of scaled Wolbachia deployments as a form of dengue control in Vietnam - targeted at the highest burden urban areas.
MethodsTen settings within Vietnam were identified as priority locations for potential future Wolbachia deployments (using a population replacement strategy).
The effectiveness of Wolbachia deployments in reducing the incidence of symptomatic dengue cases was assumed to be 75%.
We assumed that the intervention would maintain this effectiveness for at least 20 years (but tested this assumption in the sensitivity analysis).
A cost-utility analysis and cost-benefit analysis were conducted.
ResultsFrom the health sector perspective, the Wolbachia intervention was projected to cost US$420 per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted.
From the societal perspective, the overall cost-effectiveness ratio was negative, i.e.
These results are contingent on the long-term effectiveness of Wolbachia releases being sustained for 20 years.
However, the intervention was still classed as cost-effective across the majority of the settings when assuming only 10 years of benefits.
ConclusionOverall, we found that targeting high burden cities with Wolbachia deployments would be a cost-effective intervention in Vietnam and generate notable broader benefits besides health gains.
Quantifying the impact of interventions against Plasmodium vivax malaria: a model for country-specific use  In order to evaluate the impact of various intervention strategies on Plasmodium vivax dynamics, we introduce a simple mathematical model that can be easily adapted to country-specific data.
The model includes case management, vector control, mass drug administration and reactive case detection interventions and is implemented in both deterministic and stochastic frameworks.
By simulating and comparing the impact of various intervention combinations on malaria risk and burden, this model can a useful tool for strategic planning, implementation and resource mobilization.
Pharmacometric assessment of primaquine induced haemolysis in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency  BackgroundPrimaquine is an 8-aminoquinoline antimalarial.
It is the only widely available treatment to prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax malaria.
The 8-aminoquinolines cause dose dependent haemolysis in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient (G6PDd) individuals.
G6PDd is common in malaria endemic areas but testing is often not available.
As a consequence primaquine is underused.
MethodsWe conducted a pharmacometric study to characterise the relationship between primaquine dose and haemolysis in G6PDd.
The aim was to explore shorter and safer primaquine radical cure regimens compared to the currently recommended 8-weekly regimen (0.75 mg/kg once weekly), potentially obviating the need for G6PD testing.
Hemizygous G6PDd healthy adult Thai and Burmese male volunteers were admitted to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Bangkok.
In Part 1, volunteers were given ascending dose primaquine regimens whereby daily doses were increased from 7.5 mg up to 45 mg over 15 to 20 days.
In Part 2, a single primaquine 45 mg dose was given.
Results24 volunteers were enrolled in Part 1, and 16 in Part 2 (13 participated in both studies).
In three volunteers, the ascending dose regimen was stopped because of haemolysis (n=1) and asymptomatic increases in transaminases (n=2; one was hepatitis E positive).
In Part 1, the median haemoglobin concentration decline was 3.7 g/dL (range: 2.1 to 5.9; relative decline of 26% [range: 15 to 40%]).
Primaquine doses up to 0.87 mg/kg/day were tolerated subsequently without clinically significant further falls in haemoglobin.
In Part 2, the median haemoglobin concentration decline was 1.7 g/dL (range 0.9 to 4.1; relative fall of 12% [range: 7 to 30% decrease]).
The ascending dose primaquine regimens gave 7 times more drug but resulted in only double the haemoglobin decline.
Conclusions and InterpretationIn patients with Southeast Asian G6PDd variants full radical cure treatment can be given in under three weeks compared with the current 8 week regimen.
Ultrasonographic Splenic Indices Among Paediatric and Adults with Sickle Cell Disease in Nigeria  BackgroundUltrasonography is an established and reliable method for assessing the spleen.
Because of variation due to genetic and other environmental factors including malaria endemicity, interpretation of splenic sizes requires a knowledge of the normal reference range for a given population.
The aim of this study was to determine spleen size in different age groups among healthy people in North-Eastern Nigeria and use this as a reference to determine spleen size amongst sickle cell disease (SCD) patients.
MethodsUsing a cross-sectional study design, spleen size was measured in healthy people of different age groups, and steady-state SCD patients (children and adults) using abdominal ultrasonography.
Using the age-group specific reference values obtained from the controls, spleens were classified into small, normal size, or enlarged among the SCD patients.
ResultsAbdominal ultrasonography was performed for 313 participants, comprising 109 (34.8%) healthy controls and 204 (65.2%) steady-state SCD patients.
However, 97(47.6%) of the SCD patients had no visible spleen.
Small, normal, and enlarged spleens were observed in 16.7% (n=18/107), 63.6% (n=68/107) and 19.6% (n=21/107) SCD patients, respectively.
Compared to the control group, splenic length was three-fold higher in the first two years of life in SCD patients, followed by a progressive age-related decline in size.
Enlarged spleens were detected among 5(2.4%) SCD patients by manual palpation method compared to 21 (19.6%) using ultrasonography.
ConclusionModel-based age-specific reference ranges and percentile curves for splenic dimensions based on ultrasonography among normal controls in North-Eastern Nigeria were established and may be of value in assessing spleen sizes among SCD patients living in malaria-endemic regions of Africa.
Regular spleen scans to assess changes in size can help identify SCD patients at risk of splenomegaly complications including subclinical acute sequestration and hypersplenism, and those who are developing splenic atrophy.
Dengue clinical features and predictors of severity in the diabetic patient: a retrospective cohort study on Reunion island, 2019  Aim: Diabetes mellitus is associated with both the risks of severe dengue and dengue-related deaths, however the factors characterizing dengue in the diabetic patient are ill-recognized.
The objective of this hospital-based cohort study was to identify the factors characterizing dengue and those able to predict dengue severity in the diabetic patient.
MethodsWe retrospectively analysed demographic, clinical and biological parameters at admission in the cohort of patients who consulted at the university hospital between January and June 2019 with confirmed dengue.
Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted.
ResultsOf 936 patients, 184 patients (20%) were diabetic.
One hundred and eighty-eight patients (20%) developed severe dengue according to the WHO 2009 definition.
Diabetic patients were older and had more comorbidities than non-diabetics.
In an age-adjusted logistic regression model, loss of appetite, altered mental status, high neutrophil to platelet ratios (>14.7), low haematocrit ([&le;] 38%), upper-range serum creatinine (>100 {micro}mol/l) and high urea to creatinine ratio (>50) were indicative of dengue in the diabetic patient.
In a modified Poisson regression model, four key independent variables were predictive of severe dengue in the diabetic patient: presence of diabetes complications, non-severe bleeding, altered mental status and cough.
Among diabetes complications, diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy, but not diabetic nephropathy nor diabetic foot, were predictive of severe dengue.
ConclusionAt hospital first presentation, dengue in the diabetic patient is characterized by deteriorations in appetite, mental and renal functioning, while severe dengue can be predicted by presence of diabetes complications, dengue-related non-severe haemorrhages, cough, and dengue-related encephalopathy.
Severe haemolysis during primaquine radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria: two systematic reviews and individual patient data descriptive analyses  BackgroundPrimaquine (PQ) kills Plasmodium vivax hypnozoites but can cause haemolysis in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.
MethodsWe did two systematic reviews: the first used data from clinical trials to determine the spectrum of definitions and frequency of haematological serious adverse events (SAE) related to PQ treatment of vivax malaria.
The second used data from prospective studies and case reports to describe the clinical presentation, management and outcome of  severe PQ-associated haemolysis necessitating hospitalisation.
FindingsIn the first review, SAEs were reported in 70 of 249 clinical trials.
There were 34 haematological SAEs amongst 9,824 patients with vivax malaria treated with PQ, 9 of which necessitated hospitalisation or blood transfusion.
Criteria used to define SAEs were diverse.
In the second review, 21 of 8,487 articles screened reported 163 patients hospitalised following PQ radical cure; 79.9% (123/154) of whom were prescribed PQ at [&ge;]0.5mg/kg/day.
Overall, 101 patients were categorised as having probable or possible  severe PQ-associated haemolysis, 96.8% of whom were G6PD deficient (<30% activity).
The first symptoms of haemolysis were mostly reported on day 2 or 3 (45.5%) and all patients were hospitalised within 7 days of PQ commencement.
57.9% (77/133) of patients had blood transfusion.
Seven (6.9%) patients with probable or possible haemolysis died.
InterpretationEven when G6PD testing is available, enhanced monitoring for haemolysis is warranted following PQ treatment.
Clinical review within the first 5 days of treatment may facilitate early detection and management of haemolysis.
More robust definitions of severe PQ-associated haemolysis are required.
Expanding the role of village malaria workers in Cambodia: implementation and evaluation of four health education packages  BackgroundEarly access to correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment is essential for malaria elimination, and in Cambodia this relies on village malaria workers (VMWs).
Decreasing malaria transmission leave VMWs with diminished roles.
MethodsDuring 2022, 120 VMWs attended training at local health centres on four health education packages: 1. hygiene and sanitation; 2. disease surveillance; 3. management of mild illness; 4. vaccination and antenatal care.
MethodsDuring 2022, 120 VMWs attended training at local health centres on four health education packages: 1. hygiene and sanitation; 2. disease surveillance; 3. management of mild illness; 4. vaccination and antenatal care.
MethodsDuring 2022, 120 VMWs attended training at local health centres on four health education packages: 1. hygiene and sanitation; 2. disease surveillance; 3. management of mild illness; 4. vaccination and antenatal care.
All training and evaluation sessions were documented through meeting minutes, and 19 focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted among VMWs and health centre personnel.
Audio-records of FGDs were transcribed and translated in English and underwent thematic analysis.
ResultsVMWs reported strong interest in the training and welcomed the expansion of their roles thus assuring their continued relevance.
VMWs prioritized disease surveillance and management of mild illness among the available training packages because these topics were seen as most relevant.
While training was considered comprehensible and important, the low literacy among VMWs was an impediment suggesting training materials need to be delivered visually.
ConclusionsThe transformation of VMWs into community health workers with roles beyond malaria is a promising approach for sustaining health care provision in remote areas.
Training needs to consider the low scientific literacy, time constraints and limited resources of VMWs.
Lineage-informative microhaplotypes for spatio-temporal surveillance of Plasmodium vivax malaria parasites  Challenges in understanding the origin of recurrent Plasmodium vivax infections constrains the surveillance of antimalarial efficacy and transmission of this neglected parasite.
Recurrent infections within an individual may arise from activation of dormant liver stages (relapse), blood-stage treatment failure (recrudescence) or new inoculations (reinfection).
Molecular inference of familial relatedness (identity-by-descent or IBD) based on whole genome sequence data, together with analysis of the intervals between parasitaemic episodes ("time-to-event" analysis), can help resolve the probable origin of recurrences.
Whole genome sequencing of predominantly low-density P. vivax infections is challenging, so an accurate and scalable genotyping method to determine the origins of recurrent parasitaemia would be of significant benefit.
We have developed a P. vivax genome-wide informatics pipeline to select specific microhaplotype panels that can capture IBD within small, amplifiable segments of the genome.
Using a global set of 615 P. vivax genomes, we derived a panel of 100 microhaplotypes, each comprising 3-10 high frequency SNPs within <200 bp sequence windows.
This panel exhibits high diversity in regions of the Asia-Pacific, Latin America and the horn of Africa (median HE = 0.70-0.81) and it captured 89% (273/307) of the polyclonal infections detected with genome-wide datasets.
Using data simulations, we demonstrate lower error in estimating pairwise IBD using microhaplotypes, relative to traditional biallelic SNP barcodes.
Our panel exhibited high accuracy in predicting the country of origin (median Matthews correlation coefficient >0.9 in 90% countries tested) and it also captured local infection outbreak and bottlenecking events.
The informatics pipeline is available open-source and yields microhaplotypes that can be readily transferred to high-throughput amplicon sequencing assays for surveillance in malaria-endemic regions.
Analyses of vaccine-specific circulating and bone marrow-resident B cell populations reveal benefit of delayed vaccine booster dosing with blood-stage malaria antigens  We have previously reported primary endpoints of a clinical trial testing two vaccine platforms for delivery of Plasmodium vivax malaria DBPRII: viral vectors (ChAd63, MVA) and protein/adjuvant (PvDBPII with 50{micro}g Matrix-M adjuvant).
Delayed boosting was necessitated due to trial halts during the pandemic and provides an opportunity to investigate the impact of dosing regimens.
Here, using flow cytometry - including agnostic definition of B cell populations with the clustering tool CITRUS - we report enhanced induction of DBPRII-specific plasma cell and memory B cell responses in protein/adjuvant versus viral vector vaccinees.
Within protein/adjuvant groups, delayed boosting further improved B cell immunogenicity as compared to a monthly boosting regimen.
Consistent with this, delayed boosting also drove more durable anti-DBPRII serum IgG.
In an independent vaccine clinical trial with the P. falciparum malaria RH5.1 protein/adjuvant (50{micro}g Matrix-M) vaccine candidate, we similarly observed enhanced circulating B cell responses in vaccinees receiving a delayed final booster.
Notably, a higher frequency of vaccine-specific (putatively long-lived) plasma cells were detected in the bone marrow of these delayed boosting vaccinees by ELISPOT and correlated strongly with serum IgG.
Finally, following controlled human malaria infection with P. vivax parasites in the DBPRII trial, in vivo growth inhibition was observed to correlate with DBPRII-specific B cell and serum IgG responses.
In contrast, the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were impacted by vaccine platform but not dosing regimen, and did not correlate with in vivo growth inhibition in a challenge model.
Taken together, our DBPRII and RH5 data suggest an opportunity for dosing regimen optimisation in the context of rational vaccine development against pathogens where protection is antibody-mediated.
Seroprevalence of Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika at the epicenter of the congenital microcephaly epidemic in Northeast Brazil: a population-based survey  BackgroundThe Dengue viruses (DENV) serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 were re-introduced in the Northeast Brazil from the 1980s until 2010s.
Zika (ZIKV) and Chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses were introduced around 2014 and caused large outbreaks in 2015 and 2016.
However, the true extent of the ZIKV and CHIKV outbreaks and the risk factors associated with exposure remain vague.
MethodsWe conducted a stratified multistage household serosurvey among residents aged between 5 and 65 years in the city of Recife, Northeastern Brazil, from August 2018 to February 2019.
The city neighborhoods were stratified according to high, intermediate, and low socioeconomic strata (SES).
Previous ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV infections were detected by IgG based enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) .
Recent ZIKV and CHIKV infections were assessed through IgG3 and IgM ELISA, respectively.
Design-adjusted seroprevalence were estimated by age group, sex, and SES.
The ZIKV seroprevalence was adjusted to account for the cross-reactivity with dengue.
Individual and household-related risk factors were analyzed through regression models to calculate the force of infection.
Odds Ratio (OR) were estimated as measure of effect.
Principal findingsA total of 2,070 residents were investigated.
The forces of infection for high SES were lower for all three viruses as compared to low SES.
Overall, DENV seroprevalence was 88.7% (CI95%:87.0-90.4), (81.2% (CI95%:76.9-85.6) in the high SES and 90.7% (CI95%:88.3-93.2) in the low).
The overall adjusted ZIKV seroprevalence was 34.6% (CI95%:20.0-50.9), (47.4% (CI95%:31.8-61.5) in the low SES and 23.4% (CI95%:12.2-33.8) in the high).
CHIKV seroprevalence was 35.7% (CI95%:32.6-38.9), (38.6% (CI95%:33.6-43.6) in the low SES and 22.3% (CI95%:15.8-28.8) in the high).
ZIKV seroprevalence increased with age while CHIKV seroprevalence was almost constant through age.
The serological markers of recent infections for ZIKV and CHIKV were 1.5% (CI95%:0.1-3.7) and 3.5% (CI95%:2.7-4.2) respectively.
ConclusionsOur results confirmed continued DENV transmission and intense ZIKV and CHIKV transmission during the 2015/2016 epidemics followed by ongoing low-level transmission.
The study also highlights that a significant proportion of the population is likely still susceptible to be infected by ZIKV and CHIKV, raising questions on herd immunity and antibody detection thresholds and the reasons underlying cease of the ZIKV epidemic in 2017/18.
Author summaryThe extent and population burden of the Zika and Chikungunya epidemics in Northeast Brazil remains speculative since seroprevalence studies have often been restricted to specific populations and limited by ZIKV and DENV antibody cross-reactivity.
Here we conducted a seroepidemiologicla study in the city of Recife, a metropolitan area in Northeastern Brazil using a design stratified by socio-economic status (SES).
We also determined the sensitivity and specificity of the assays used and selected optimum cut-offs, which were and later confirmed by selecting a subset of samples to on which more specific virus neutralizations tests were performed.
The result indicated that 89% of the population (older than 5 years of age) had previous dengue infection, compatible with our previous serosurvey.
The assay sensitivity and specificity seroprevalences for ZIKV was 34.6% and CHIKV 35.7%, indicating high transmission during the outbreaks (2015/2016).
Interestingly, the age distribution profiles of ZIKV and CHIKV seroprevalence were remarkably different.
These differences cannot be explained by differences in mosquito exposure alone.
A gene network implicated in the joint-muscle pain, brain fog, chronic fatigue, and bowel irregularity of Ehlers-Danlos and "long" COVID19 syndromes.
ObjectivesCharacterization of tissue laxity and dysautonomia symptoms in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) uncovered similarities with those of post-infectious SARS-CoV-2 or long COVID19, prompting detailed comparison of their findings and influencing genes.
MethodsHolistic assessment of 1261 EDS outpatients for 120 history-physical findings populated a deidentified database that includes 568 patients with 317 variant genes obtained by commercial NextGen sequencing.
Findings were compared to 15 of long COVID19 compiled in an extensive review, genes to 104 associated with COVID19 severity in multiple molecular studies.
ResultsFifteen symptoms common to Ehlers-Danlos versus long COVID19 ranged from brain fog (27-80 versus 30-70%), chronic fatigue (38-91; 30-60%), dyspnea (32-52; 29-52%) to irritable bowel (67-89; 14-78%), muscle weakness (22-49; 15-25%), and arthritis (32-94; 15-27%).
Genes relevant to EDS included 6 identical to those influencing COVID19 severity (F2, LIFR, NLRP3, STAT1, T1CAM1, TNFRSF13B) and 18 similar including POLG-POLD4, SLC6A2-SLC6A20, and NFKB1-NFKB2.
Both gene sets had broad genomic distribution, many mitochondrial genes influencing EDS and many involved with immunity-inflammation modifying COVID19 severity.
Recurring DNA variants in EDS that merit evaluation in COVID19 resistance include those impacting connective tissue elements--51 in COL5 (joint), 29 in COL1/2/9/11 (bone), 13 in COL3 (vessel), and 18 in FBN1 (vessel-heart)--or neural function--93 in mitochondrial DNA, 28 in COL6/12, 16 in SCN9A/10A/11A, 14 in POLG, and 11 in genes associated with porphyria.
Implied networks of nuclear and mitochondrial genes are linked to findings like brain fog, fatigue, and frailty in EDS, their similarity to long COVID19 supporting shared therapies for disorders affecting a minimum 0.1% of the global population.
Risk factors for arboviral seropositivity in children in Teso South Sub County, Western Kenya  Arboviruses are responsible for epidemics and are emerging and re-emerging in sub-Saharan Africa.
However, the risk factors for arboviral diseases are poorly described in Kenyan children.
This study determined risk factors for seropositivity to Yellow fever (YFV), Dengue (DENV), Chikungunya (CHIKV) and West Nile (WNV) viruses among children at two facilities in Teso Sub-County in Western Kenya.
In a hospital-based cross-sectional survey, the risk factors for seropositivity to the arboviruses were assessed.
Eligible children aged 1 to 12 (n = 656) who visited Alupe Sub County Hospital and KEMRI Alupe Clinic in Teso Sub County were recruited.
Blood drawn from these children was screened for antibodies to YFV, DENV, CHIKV and WNV using Indirect Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays.
Descriptive statistics were used to summarise seroprevalence, socio-demographic, clinical and environmental variables.
Binomial logistic regression described the relationship between the risk factors and arbovirus seropositivity.
Seropositivity to at least one arbovirus was found in 27.7%, with 15.7% being positive for DENV, 9.6% for WNV, 5.6% for CHIKV and 4.4% for YFV.
The factors that significantly increased the risk to at least one of the arboviruses were: age 6-9 years (by 18%, p=0.006) compared to those 1-3 years, school attendance (by 66%, p=0.000) compared to none, the primary caregiver being "Other" (by 17%, p=0.026) and not the parent, the use of Olyset (by 7%, p=0.039), or an unknown mosquito net (by 26%, p=0.020) compared to Permanet.
The risk of yellow fever seropositivity was increased where vegetation was close to the house (by 5%, p=0.042) compared to where vegetation was far.
The risk was decreased by the use of an unknown bed net (by 4%, p=0.046) compared to Permanet and having a past history of rash (by 6%, p=0.018).
For Dengue Fever, females were at an increased risk (by 8%, p=0.002) compared to males and having water bodies near the house (7%, p=0.030).
The risk of chikungunya was increased by school attendance (by 25%, p=0.021) compared to not, the use of mosquito repellents (by 10%, p=0.006) compared to no interventions and having had a rash in the past (by 6%, p=0.043).
The risk was decreased by roofing with iron sheets (by 3%, p=0.048) compared to grass-thatching.
WNV seropositivity risk was higher in those aged 3-6 years (by 8%, p=0.004) and 6-9 years (by 15%, p=0.004) than in those aged 1-3 years.
It was increased in those attending school (by 37%, p=0.006) compared to those not, and those using Olyset (by 11%, p=0.000) or an unknown bed net (by 30%, p=0.001) compared to Permanet.
The risk was lower by between 25% and 33% (p<0.003) in those in pre-school, in lower and upper primary compared to those not in school.
These factors are amenable to interventions that can be implemented to prevent and reduce arbovirus infections in children in endemic areas in Kenya.
Author SummaryYellow fever, Dengue, Chikungunya and West Nile are viruses (Arboviruses) transmitted to humans by mosquitoes.
These infections are common in Sub-Saharan Africa and often affect children.
However, the risk factors associated with arboviral infections are not well described, and yet, knowledge of these predisposing factors in children is essential for early diagnosis, correct treatment, and prevention.
We recruited 656 children aged between 1-12 years who sought health services at Alupe Sub-County Hospital and KEMRI Alupe Clinic in Teso Sub-County, Western Kenya.
Out of 656 participants, 182 (27.7%) were seropositive for at least one of the four arboviruses, 29 (4.4%) for Yellow Fever, 102 (15.7%) for Dengue, 36 (5.6%) for Chikungunya and 62 (9.6%) for West Nile virus.
These behavioural, environmental, sociodemographic and clinical factors that influence arbovirus seropositivity are amenable to interventions that can be implemented within the community to reduce the risk and prevalence of arboviruses in children in endemic areas in Kenya.
Resource allocation strategies to achieve malaria eradication  BackgroundLarge reductions in the global malaria burden have been achieved in the last decades, but plateauing funding poses a challenge for progressing towards the ultimate goal of malaria eradication.
MethodsUsing previously published mathematical models of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax transmission incorporating insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) as an illustrative intervention, we sought to identify the global funding allocation that maximized impact under defined objectives and across a range of global funding budgets.
ResultsWe found that the optimal strategy for case reduction closely mirrored an allocation framework that prioritizes funding for high-transmission settings, resulting in total case reductions of 76% (optimal strategy) and 66% (prioritizing high-transmission settings) at intermediate budget levels.
Allocation strategies that had the greatest impact on case reductions were associated with lesser near-term impacts on the global population at risk, highlighting a trade-off between reducing burden and "shrinking the map" through a focus on near-elimination settings.
The optimal funding distribution prioritized high ITN coverage in high-transmission settings endemic for P. falciparum only, while maintaining lower levels in low-transmission settings.
However, at high budgets, 62% of funding was targeted to low-transmission settings co-endemic for P. falciparum and P. vivax.
However, at high budgets, 62% of funding was targeted to low-transmission settings co-endemic for P. falciparum and P. vivax.
ConclusionsThese results support current global strategies to prioritize funding to high-burden P. falciparum-endemic settings in sub-Saharan Africa to minimize clinical malaria burden and progress towards elimination but highlight competing goals of reducing the global population at risk and addressing the burden of P. vivax.

Superior antibody immunogenicity of a RH5 blood-stage malaria vaccine in Tanzanian infants as compared to adults  BackgroundRH5 is the leading blood-stage candidate antigen for inclusion in a Plasmodium falciparum malaria vaccine, however, its safety profile and ability to induce functional immune responses in a malaria-endemic population are unknown.
Characterising safety and immunogenicity is key to refine and progress next-generation RH5-based blood-stage malaria vaccines to field efficacy assessment.
MethodsA Phase 1b, single-center, dose-escalation, age de-escalation, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in Bagamoyo, Tanzania.
Healthy adults (18-35 years), young children (1-6 years) and infants (6-11 months) were recruited to receive a priming dose of viral-vectored ChAd63 RH5 (or rabies control vaccine) followed by a booster dose of MVA RH5 (or rabies control vaccine) 8 weeks later.
The primary outcomes were the number of solicited and unsolicited adverse events following vaccination and the number of serious adverse events over the whole study period.
All participants receiving at least one dose of vaccine were included in the primary analyses.
FindingsBetween 12th April and 25th October 2018 a total of 63 adults, children and infants were recruited and primed and 60 of these were boosted, all completing six months of follow-up post-priming vaccination.
Vaccinations were well-tolerated with participants reporting predominantly mild reactogenicity, with profiles comparable between ChAd63 RH5, MVA RH5 and rabies vaccine groups, and across the age groups.
No serious adverse events were reported during the study period.
RH5-specific T cell, B cell and serum antibody responses were induced by vaccination.
Higher anti-RH5 serum IgG responses were observed post-boost in the 1-6 year old children (median 93 {micro}g/mL; range: 31-508 {micro}g/mL) and infants (median 149 {micro}g/mL; range: 29-352 {micro}g/mL) as compared to adults (median 14 {micro}g/mL; range: 9-15 {micro}g/mL).
These contracted over time post-boost, but the same hierarchy of responses across the age groups was maintained to end of follow-up at 16 weeks post-boost (day 168).
Vaccine-induced anti-RH5 antibodies were functional showing growth inhibition activity (GIA) in vitro against P. falciparum blood-stage parasites.
The highest levels were observed in the 6-11 month old infants, with 6/11 showing >60% GIA following dilution of total IgG to 2.5 mg/mL (median 61%; range: 41-78%).
InterpretationThe ChAd63-MVA RH5 vaccine regimen shows an acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile and encouraging immunogenicity in children and infants residing in a malaria-endemic area.
The levels of functional GIA observed in the RH5 vaccinated 6-11 month old infants are the highest levels reported to-date following human vaccination.
These data support onward clinical development of RH5-based blood-stage vaccines that aim to protect against clinical malaria in young African infants.

Reanalysis of cluster randomized trial data to account for exposure misclassification using a per-protocol and complier-restricted approach  The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of the Applying Wolbachia to Eliminate Dengue (AWED) trial estimated a protective efficacy of 77.1% for participants resident in areas randomised to receive releases of wMel-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, an emerging dengue preventive intervention.
The limiting assumptions of ITT analyses in cluster randomised trials and the mobility of mosquitoes and humans across cluster boundaries indicate the primary analysis is likely to underestimate the full public health benefit.
Using spatiotemporally-resolved data on the distribution of Wolbachia mosquitoes and on the mobility of AWED participants (n = 6,306), we perform complier-restricted and per-protocol re-examinations of the efficacy of the Wolbachia intervention.
Increased intervention efficacy was estimated in all analyses by the refined exposure measures.
The complier-restricted analysis returned an estimated efficacy of 80.7% (95% CI: 65.9, 89.0) and the per-protocol analysis estimated 82.7% (71.7, 88.4) efficacy when comparing participants with an estimated wMel exposure of[&ge;] 80% compared to those with <20%.
These reanalyses demonstrate how human and mosquito movement can lead to underestimation of intervention effects in trials of vector interventions and indicate that the protective efficacy of Wolbachia is even higher than reported in the primary trial results.
Cryptic transmission and re-emergence of Cosmopolitan genotype of Dengue Virus Serotype 2 within Ho Chi Minh City and Southern Vietnam  BackgroundDengue virus (DENV) is a major global public health threat and causes substantial morbidity and mortality in hyperendemic countries like Vietnam with its largest city, Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), recently experiencing its largest DENV outbreak in over a decade.
Despite this, there is currently a lack of data on circulating DENV serotypes/genotypes and monitoring of transmission dynamics within HCMC, which presents a challenge for the design and implementation of effective DENV mitigation strategies.
MethodsWe generated 45 DENV envelope (E) gene sequences from human plasma samples collected in southern Vietnam between 2017 and 2022.
We applied phylogenetic methods to infer the probable route of virus introductions into HCMC and its surrounding areas, as well as their approximate timing, using additional sequences from Southern and South-east Asia.
FindingsWe found evidence of the co-circulation of multiple DENV serotypes/genotypes and the re-emergence of the DENV-2 Cosmopolitan genotype in southern Vietnam.
Furthermore, we detected at least three independent seeding events of the Cosmopolitan genotype into Vietnam, the earliest of which is estimated to have occurred two years before the earliest sampling date, providing evidence of at least two seasons of cryptic transmission.
InterpretationOur findings emphasize the urgent need for comprehensive DENV surveillance in HCMC and Vietnam to guide appropriate and effective public health responses and improve understanding of recent outbreak dynamics in Vietnam and neighbouring countries.
Such efforts may also help predict epidemic dynamics of DENV in future seasons.
FundingThis work was supported by the Wellcome Trust [106680] and Wellcome Trust [226052/Z/22/Z]  Evidence before this studyDengue virus (DENV) is a significant threat to global health causing high levels of morbidity and economic damage.
With the limited surveillance infrastructure for DENV, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, little is currently known about the transmission dynamics in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) and Vietnam presenting a challenge for the design and implementation of DENV mitigation strategies.
Added value of this studyGenomic epidemiology is a powerful approach to gain insights into the spatio-temporal dynamics of viruses and to detect new viral variants.
Our analyses shows the existence of multiple co-circulating DENV-2 genotypes in southern Vietnam with multiple distinct and continued introductions of the Cosmopolitan genotype into HCMC over multiple years.
Implications of all the available evidenceFindings from this study will assist local and regional dengue surveillance and control programs as well as adding to our understanding on DENV genomic epidemiology and transmission dynamics.
Critically, current dengue screening and surveillance methodology should be modified to enable detection of these novel lineages.
The emergence of these genotypes and their impact on dengue evolution need to be explored on a larger scale.
We plan to integrate these findings into a DENV forecasting tool being developed as part of Wellcome funded multidisciplinary project - DART (Dengue Advanced Readiness Tools), which aims to build an integrated digital system for dengue outbreak prediction and monitoring.
Epidemiology of Plasmodium malariae and 	Plasmodium ovale spp.
in a highly malaria-endemic country: a longitudinal cohort study in Kinshasa Province, Democratic Republic of Congo  BackgroundIncreasing reports suggest that non-falciparum species are an underappreciated cause of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, but their epidemiology is not well-defined.
This is particularly true in regions of high P. falciparum endemicity such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where 12% of the worlds malaria cases and 13% of deaths occur.
Methods and FindingsThe cumulative incidence and prevalence of P. malariae and P. ovale spp.

infection detected by real-time PCR were estimated among children and adults within a longitudinal study conducted in seven rural, peri-urban, and urban sites from 2015-2017 in Kinshasa Province, DRC.
Participants were sampled at biannual household survey visits (asymptomatic) and during routine health facility visits (symptomatic).
Participant-level characteristics associated with non-falciparum infections were estimated for single- and mixed-species infections.
Among 9,089 samples collected from 1,565 participants over a 3-year period, the incidence of P. malariae and P. ovale spp.

infection was 11% (95% CI: 9%-12%) and 7% (95% CI: 5%-8%) by one year, respectively, compared to a 67% (95% CI: 64%-70%) one-year cumulative incidence of P. falciparum infection.
Incidence continued to rise in the second year of follow-up, reaching 26% and 15% in school-age children (5-14yo) for P. malariae and P. ovale spp., respectively.

Non-falciparum malaria was more prevalent in rural and peri-urban vs. urban sites, in school-age children, and among those with P. falciparum co-infection.
Non-falciparum malaria was more prevalent in rural and peri-urban vs. urban sites, in school-age children, and among those with P. falciparum co-infection.
A crude association was detected between P. malariae and any anemia in the symptomatic clinic population, although this association did not hold when stratified by anemia severity.
No crude associations were detected between non-falciparum infection and fever prevalence.
falciparum remains the primary driver of malaria morbidity and mortality in the DRC.
However, non-falciparum species also pose an infection risk across sites of varying urbanicity and malaria endemicity within Kinshasa, DRC, particularly among children under 15 years of age.
As P. falciparum interventions gain traction in high-burden settings like the DRC, continued surveillance and improved understanding of non-falciparum infections are warranted.
Human SARS-CoV-2 challenge resolves local and systemic response dynamics  The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the cellular disease dynamics remains limited.
In our unique COVID-19 human challenge study we used single cell genomics of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in 16 seronegative individuals challenged with preAlpha-SARS-CoV-2.
Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific timepoints or infection status.
We observed that the interferon response in blood precedes the nasopharynx, and that nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in transient but later in sustained infection, and thus correlated with preventing sustained infection.
Ciliated cells showed an acute response phase, upregulated MHC class II while infected, and were most permissive for viral replication, whilst nasal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively.
We resolve 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs.
Our novel computational pipeline (Cell2TCR) identifies activated antigen-responding clonotype groups and motifs in any dataset.
Emerging viruses are an underestimated cause of undiagnosed febrile illness in Uganda  BackgroundViruses that cause acute febrile illness (AFI) in sub-Saharan Africa cause a spectrum of disease from mild to life-threatening.
Viral infection is often undiagnosed, as routine diagnostics are insufficient to capture the diversity of circulating pathogens.
Methods1281 patients with fever of 2-7 days were prospectively recruited from three sites in Uganda as part of the CDC-UVRI AFI Study and screened with enhanced diagnostics.
Plasma from 233 undiagnosed patients was analysed using metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS).
Confirmatory testing was carried out by PCR and serology.
FindingsThirty-eight viral pathogens were identified by mNGS in 35/233 (15%) undiagnosed patients including Measles, Hepatitis A/B/E viruses, Human immunodeficiency virus-1, Rhinovirus, Rotavirus-like virus, Human herpesvirus 6B, Human parainfluenza virus 3 and Enteroviruses.
Four high-consequence arboviruses were found in six patients; Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus, dengue virus and yellow fever virus.
Le Dantec virus, last reported in 1969, was detected and confirmed by serology in one patient (and a contact of that patient).
The majority of patients (23/30; 76%) diagnosed with an acute viral infection were treated with antibiotics and/or (12/30; 40%) antimalarials.
InterpretationAFI in Uganda is commonly associated with undiagnosed viral infection, including high-consequence and rarely reported viruses.
MNGS alongside diagnostic serology is a powerful method for clinical surveillance to investigate circulating viral pathogens.
Cost-effective diagnostic assays should be adapted according to regional needs for testing.

ANAEMIA IN CHILDREN AGED 7 MONTHS TO 12 YEARS AND ASSOCIATED FACTORS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY OF CHILDREN ADMITTED AT THE EFFIDUASE DISTRICT HOSPITAL AND AHMADIYYA MISSION HOSPITAL, GHANA.
A number of factors have been identified as influencing the prevalence of anaemia in children.
In the Sekyere East district, an increasing trend of children with severe anaemia leading to haemotransfusion has been observed.
Over a three-month period (June to August 2022) approximately one hundred (100) children were haemotransfused due to severe anaemia in the Effiduase district hospital.
Specifically, the study sought to explore the prevalence of childhood anaemia and its associated factors in the district.
Purposive sampling technique which is a non-probability (non-randomized) was used to select children and their guardians to partake in the study.
SPSS statistical software version 25 was used to analyze quantitative data of this study and data were presented in frequencies using tables.
This study has accentuated high prevalence of anaemia in the Sekyere East district looking at the various findings brought to light by the Haemoglobin (Hb) blood analysis, Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) blood tests and the Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin (MCH) test results.
The findings from the study have also shown that malaria in children is significantly associated with the onset of childhood anaemia.
The study additionally revealed moderate nutritional intake of food products very rich in iron, vitamin B12 and folate nutrients necessary to curb anaemia in children.
In conclusion, study findings therefore underscore the need for multi-faceted approaches that address both malaria control and nutrition in order to reduce anaemia among the children in the Sekyere East district.
Zika Virus looming epidemic in Pakistan: seroprevalence findings by plaque reduction neutralization test in the Sindh Region of Pakistan  BackgroundZika virus (ZIKV) has emerged as a cause of febrile illness in children and adults globally.
West Asian and Middle Eastern countries have not yet experienced the widespread emergence of ZIKV.
In Pakistan, detection of ZIKV antibodies have been reported.
In order to determine if ZIKV is circulating in the Sindh region of Pakistan, patients presenting to healthcare centers with an acute febrile dengue-like illness were evaluated for ZIKV infection.
MethodsDengue virus (DENV) screening in patients was performed using a commercial ELISA Rapid Test NS1 antigen capture test.
All DENV negative samples were tested for Zika virus, using a commercial IgM capture ELISA kit.
Additionally, a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) was performed to measure neutralizing antibodies.
Singleplex, two-step Real-time PCR using general primers and probes was performed for the detection of Zika virus nucleic acid.
ResultsPatients with acute dengue-like illness (DLI) presenting at healthcare centers in different sites throughout the Sindh region of Pakistan were recruited.
A total of 745 patient samples were tested for ZIKV via IgM ELISA and RT-PCR.
Thirty-seven samples (4.9%) tested positive for ZIKV IgM without any cross-reactivity to other flaviviruses tested simultaneously.
These were considered as presumptive positive for ZIKV, selected presumptive positive samples (n=20) were confirmed using PRNT50 using Vero cells.
All 20 samples showed ZIKV neutralization at PRNT50.
ConclusionsOur study provides evidence that ZIKV is circulating in the Sindh region of Pakistan and is a probable cause of clinical dengue-like illness (DLI) cases that are seen seasonally in Pakistan.
Antenatal care attendance, intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy and knowledge on malaria: A cross sectional study in a government and a private district Hospitals  Ghana has made significant strides in maternal healthcare under the National Health Insurance Scheme, but more effort is required to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 3.1 target of <70 deaths/100,000 live births from the current 308 deaths/100,000.
This study sought to investigate knowledge about ANC, ANC attendance, knowledge about malaria and IPTp among pregnant women, visiting a government Hospital in Mafi-Adidome (a rural community) and a private Hospital in Battor-Dugame (a rural-urban community) in the Volta region (a high malaria endemic area in Ghana).
A total of 1295 consenting pregnant women participated in the study.
Information on sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge about ANC, IPTp and knowledge about malaria were collected by questionnaire.
Chi-square tests were used to compare proportions of variables across the two study sites.
Higher proportion (70.8%) of participants accessing Battor Catholic Hospital showed adequate knowledge about ANC than 38.1% in Adidome Government Hospital (X2(7) =105.11; p<0.001).
Also, higher numbers (46.6%) in Battor Catholic Hospital showed adequate knowledge on the timing for IPTp administration than 21.1% in Adidome Government Hospital (X2(2) =83.37; p<0.001).
Although knowledge about malaria was generally low (0-33.3%) at both health centres, high proportions of participants (>80%) possess and use mosquito bed nets for malaria prevention.
A lower proportion (46.6%) of participants in Battor Catholic Hospital made the WHO recommended 4-7 visits compared to 50.2% participants in Adidome Government Hospital.
Age, marital status, employment and education influenced utilization of antenatal and delivery services.
More sensitization on the importance of ANC and hospital delivery is needed in the study areas.
A blended learning approach for capacity strengthening to improve the quality of integrated HIV, TB, and Malaria services during antenatal and postnatal care in LMICs: A feasibility study  The blended learning (BL) approach to training health care professionals is increasingly adopted in many countries because of high costs and disruption to service delivery in the light of severe human resource shortage in low resource settings.
The Covid-19 pandemic increased the urgency to identify alternatives to traditional face-to-face (f2f) education approach.
A four-day f2f antenatal care (ANC) and postnatal care (PNC) continuous professional development course (CPD) was repackaged into a 3-part BL course; 1) self-directed learning (16 hours) 2) facilitated virtual sessions (2.5 hours over 3 days) and 3) 2-day f2f sessions.
A mixed methods design was used.
A total of 89 healthcare professionals, were purposively selected.
Quantitative data was collected through an online questionnaire and skills assessments, analyzed using STATA 12 software.
Majority of participants (86%) accessed the online sessions using a mobile phone from home and health facilities.
The median (IQR) time of completing the self-directed component was 16 hours, IQR (8, 30).
A multi-disciplinary team comprising of 42% nurse-midwives, 28% doctors, 20% clinical officers and 10% other healthcare professionals completed the BL course.
Participants liked the BL approach due to its flexibility in learning, highly educative/relevant content, mixing of health worker cadres and CPD points.
Aspects that were noted as challenging were related to personal log-in details and network connectivity issues during the self-directed learning and facilitated virtual sessions respectively.
The blended learning approach to ANC-PNC in-service training was found to be feasible, cost saving compared to the face-to-face approach and acceptable to health care professionals in LMICs.
Short-term health system responses to epidemics across hard-to-reach areas in sub-Saharan Africa: A scoping review protocol  BackgroundEpidemics and disease outbreaks are the occurrence of cases of disease in excess of what would be normally expected.
Epidemic-prone diseases, including emerging and re-emerging diseases, constitute the greatest threat to public health security and disruption of social and economic development.
In the past 20 years, the sub-Saharan region has witnessed a marked increase in the number of outbreaks in pandemics, such as cholera, dengue, A/H5N 1 influenza, and rift valley fever, among others.
This study thus details a scoping review of short-term health system responses to epidemics across hard-to-reach areas in sub-Saharan Africa.
MethodsA scoping review will be undertaken following PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews.
A modified Donabedian framework will be used to help in understanding approaches used in the immediate health system responses to disease outbreaks.
In addition, manual searches will be carried out through related articles and websites.
OutcomeWe anticipate developing a document that will show the different approaches health systems responded with to epidemics in the short term and that will contribute to strengthening future short-term responses to disease outbreaks by identifying best practices and innovative ideas.
Reasons for mosquito net non-use in malaria-endemic countries: A review of qualitative research published between 2011 and 2021.
Mosquito nets, particularly insecticide-treated nets [ITNs], are the most recommended method of malaria control in endemic countries.
We present a systematic review of qualitative research published in the past decade to assess the growth and quality of qualitative papers about net non-use and examine and update the current understanding.
A comprehensive literature search was carried out in MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Global Health, in addition to a citation search of the initial review.
The critical appraisal assessment tool was used to ensure quality.
Thematic synthesis was used to extract, synthesise, and analyse study findings.
Compared to the initial review, the results showed a ten-fold increase in qualitative research on the reasons for mosquito net non-use between 2011 and 2021.
In addition, the quality of the research has improved, with more than 90% of the papers receiving high scores, using the critical appraisal assessment tool.
More than two-thirds of the studies were carried out in Africa, with lead African researchers in African institutions.
Despite the distribution of free mosquito nets in malaria-endemic countries, new challenges to their use continue to emerge.
The most common reasons for net non-use across all regions of Malaria endemic countries were discomfort and perceived ineffectiveness of nets.
Technical challenges and improper net use dominated East and South African regions, signifying the need for dedicated and region-specific measures and strategies to ensure the continued usage of mosquito nets, particularly ITNs.
Improving malaria case management with artemisinin-based combination therapies and malaria rapid diagnostic tests in private medicine retail outlets in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review  Private medicine retailers (PMRs) such as pharmacies and drug stores account for a substantial share of treatment-seeking for fever and malaria, but there are widespread concerns about quality of care, including inadequate access to malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs).
This review synthesizes evidence on the effectiveness of interventions to improve malaria case management in PMRs in sub-Saharan Africa (PROSPERO #2021:CRD42021253564).
We conducted a narrative synthesis by intervention category.
There was strong evidence that small and large-scale ACT subsidy programmes (without RDTs) increased the market share of quality-assured ACT in PMRs, including among rural and poorer groups, with increases of over 30 percentage points in most settings.
Interventions to introduce or enhance RDT use in PMRs led to RDT uptake among febrile clients of over two-thirds and dispensing according to RDT result of over three quarters, though some studies had much poorer results.
Introducing Integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) was also effective in improving malaria case management.
However, there were no eligible studies on RDT or iCCM implementation at large scale.
There was limited evidence that PMR accreditation (without RDTs) increased ACT uptake.
Key evidence gaps include evaluations of RDTs and iCCM at large scale, evaluations of interventions including use of digital technologies, and robust studies of accreditation and other broader PMR interventions.
INVESTIGATING HEALTH PROFESSIONALS UNDERSTANDING AND RISK PERCEPTION OF THE EFFECT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON HEALTH.
The study investigated health professionals understanding and risk perception of climate change in the Sunyani Municipality by focusing on health professionals knowledge on climate change, examining health professionals risk perception of climate change on health and identifying the co-benefits of climate change mitigation.
This quantitative oriented cross-sectional study randomly selected 400 health professionals across the Regional Hospital, SDA Hospital and Municipal Hospital as respondents.
Quantitative data was analyzed using SPSS Version 25.
There was a statistical relationship between respondents perception that climate change can lead to death (P<0.001) and their awareness of the risk of climate change impact on health.
There was a general likelihood of an increase in malaria (Mean=2.98), Dengue fever (Mean=3.16), Cholera (Mean= 3.18), schistosomiasis (Mean=3.27), Meningococcal meningitis (Mean=3.85) and Influenza (Mean=3.73) due to climate change.
These actions positively affect health and climate and they include: Giving up red meat (Mean=3.21), Walking and cycling instead of using cars (Mean=3.27), Reducing rural-urban migration (Mean=3.46), Reducing air pollution from emission of fossil fuel (Mean=3.63).
A majority of 65% of respondents agreed to the incorporation of climate change related course work into nursing/medical school curricula as a policy to mitigate climate change.
The general risk perception of health professionals towards climate change impact on health was high.
Climate change mitigation is beneficial to human populations.
Characterisation of populations at risk of sub-optimal dosing of artemisinin-based combination therapy in Africa  IntroductionSelection of resistant malaria strains occurs when parasites are exposed to inadequate antimalarial drug concentrations.
The proportion of uncomplicated falciparum malaria patients at risk of being sub-optimally dosed with the current World Health Organization (WHO) recommended artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) is unknown.
This study aims to estimate this proportion and the excess number of treatment failures (recrudescences) associated with sub-optimal dosing in Sub-Saharan Africa.
MethodsSub-populations at risk of sub-optimal dosing include wasted children <5 years of age; patients with hyperparasitaemia; pregnant women; people living with HIV; and overweight adults.
Country-level data on population structure were extracted from openly accessible data sources.
Pooled adjusted Hazard Ratios for PCR-confirmed recrudescence were estimated for each risk group from published meta-analyses using fixed-effect meta-analysis.
ResultsIn 2020, of 153.1 million uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria patients in Africa, the largest risk groups were the hyperparasitaemic patients (13.2 million, 8.6% of uncomplicated malaria cases) and overweight adults (10.3 million, 6.7% of uncomplicated cases).
The excess total number of treatment failures ranged from 323,247 for a 98% baseline ACT efficacy to 1,292,987 for a 92% baseline ACT efficacy.
ConclusionAn estimated 1 in nearly 4 people with uncomplicated confirmed P. falciparum malaria in Africa are at risk of receiving a sub-optimal antimalarial drug dosing.
This increases the risk of antimalarial drug resistance and poses a serious threat to malaria control and elimination efforts.
Changes in antimalarial dosing or treatment duration of current antimalarials may be needed and new antimalarials development should ensure sufficient drug concentration levels in these sub-populations that carry a high malaria burden.
HIV prevalence and associated factors in married women: analysis of the 2015 national health survey (IMASIDA)  BackgroundThe 2021 human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) global report indicated that women and girls in sub-Saharan Africa remained the most affected groups, accounting for 62% of new infections in the region.
In 2021 in Mozambique, the HIV prevalence rate among the adult population was 12.5%, with a rate of 15.4% among women of reproductive age.
Our study assessed HIV prevalence and associated factors among married women in Mozambique.
MethodologyA cross-sectional epidemiological study was carried out using secondary data extracted from the 2015 Immunization, Malaria and HIV/AIDS (IMASIDA) survey in Mozambique.
Married women (civil marriage and common law marriage) of reproductive age (15-49 years) were included.
We applied sample weights for data analysis.
ResultsOut of the 3,006 married women included in the study, 20.1% fell within the 20-24 age group (n=603), and the average age was 30 years (SD=8.9 years).
HIV prevalence was 6.9%.
Factors significantly associated with HIV infection were age group 35-49 years (aOR=2.5; CI [1.3-4.6]; p=0.005) compared to age group 15-24 years, lack of formal education and primary education compared to higher education (aOR 7.7; CI [1.1-52.9], p=0.038 and aOR=9.8; CI [1.6-60.1]; p=0.014 respectively), having an uncircumcised partner (aOR=1.9; CI [1.2-3.1]; p=0.008), and having three or more lifetime sex partners compared to one sex partner (aOR=3.6; CI [2.9-7.3]; p< 0.001).
Women who were in one lifelong union had a lower risk of HIV positivity compared to women who hadmore than one union (aOR=0.5; CI[0.3-0.8] p=0.005).
ConclusionThe factors that contributed to a greater odds of HIV-positivity in this group of married Mozambican women were older age, low levels of education, having an uncircumcised partner and having more than one sexual partner throughout ones lifetime.
In order to have maximum effect, HIV prevention and control campaigns in Mozambique should be tailored tothese "higher-risk" populations.
Tafenoquine following G6PD screening versus primaquine for the treatment of vivax malaria in Brazil: a cost-effectiveness analysis using a transmission model  BackgroundMalaria transmission modelling has demonstrated the potential impact of semi-quantitative glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) testing and treatment with single-dose tafenoquine for Plasmodium vivax radical cure.
MethodsWe explored the cost-effectiveness of using tafenoquine after G6PD screening as compared to usual practice (7-day low-dose primaquine (0.5 mg/kg/day) without G6PD screening) in Brazil using a 10-year time horizon with 5% discounting considering four scenarios: 1) tafenoquine for adults only assuming 66.7% primaquine treatment adherence, 2) tafenoquine for adults and children aged >2 years assuming 66.7% primaquine adherence, 3) tafenoquine for adults only assuming 90% primaquine adherence, 4) tafenoquine for adults only assuming 30% primaquine adherence.
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated by dividing the incremental costs by the disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted.
These were compared to a willingness to pay threshold of US$7,800 for Brazil, and one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
One-way sensitivity analyses showed that the results were most sensitive to severity and mortality due to vivax malaria, the lifetime and number of semi-quantitative G6PD analysers needed, cost per malaria episode and per G6PD test strips, and life expectancy.
All scenarios had a 100% likelihood of being cost-effective at the willingness to pay threshold.
ConclusionsTafenoquine prescribed after a semi-quantitative G6PD testing is highly likely to be cost-effective in Brazil.
Implementation and effectiveness outcomes of Community Health Advocacy Teams to improve long-lasting insecticide net distribution and use in six districts in Ghana: a one-group pre-post-test study.
Malaria remains a leading cause of illness and death especially among children and pregnant women in Ghana.
Despite the efforts made by the National Malaria Elimination Programme (NMEP), including distribution of Long-Lasting Insecticide Nets (LLIN) to households through periodic Point Mass Distribution (PMD) campaigns and continuous channels (antenatal, schools and postnatal), there is a gap between access and use of LLINs in Ghana.
An effective and functional community-based group that would seek to improve the effectiveness of LLIN distribution before, during, after PMD Campaigns and continuous distribution at the community level could help address this gap.
The study employed a one-group pre-post study design and measured implementation outcomes (acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility) and effectiveness outcomes (LLIN awareness, LLIN access, willingness to purchase LLIN, and LLIN use) among 800 community households.
The CHAT intervention was implemented for four months across six districts in the Eastern and Volta regions of Ghana.
The data were downloaded directly from REDCap and analyzed statistically (descriptive and McNemar test of association) using SPSS 22 software.
After the implementation period, the majority of respondents in all six districts indicated that the CHAT intervention was acceptable (89.8%), appropriate (89.5%), and feasible (90%).
Household members awareness of, access to, willingness to purchase, and use of LLINs increased significantly over the four-month period that the CHAT intervention was implemented.
The study concludes that CHAT is an acceptable, appropriate, and feasible intervention for supporting the National Malaria Programme in LLIN PMD and for engaging in Social and Behaviour Change Communication activities through the continuous channels of distribution.
Additionally, the CHAT demonstrates short-term effectiveness outcomes in terms of creating LLIN awareness, providing access to LLIN, and encouraging Ghanaian community members to be willing to purchase and use LLINs.
Covid19Vaxplorer: a free, online, user-friendly COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Comparison Tool  BackgroundThere are many COVID-19 vaccines currently available, however, Low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) still have large proportions of their populations unvaccinated.
Decision-makers must decide how to effectively allocate available vaccines (e.g.
boosters or primary series vaccination, which age groups to target) but LMIC often lack the resources to undergo quantitative analyses of vaccine allocation, resulting in adhoc policies.
We developed Covid19Vaxplorer (https://covid19vaxplorer.fredhutch.org/), a free, user-friendly online tool that simulates region-specific COVID-19 epidemics in conjunction with vaccination with the purpose of providing public health officials worldwide with a tool for vaccine allocation planning and comparison.
MethodsWe developed an age-structured mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 vaccination.
The model considers vaccination with up to three different vaccine products, primary series and boosters.
The model is embedded in an online tool, Covid19Vaxplorer that was optimized for its ease of use.

Covid19Vaxplorer connects the user to the mathematical model and simulates, in real time, region-specific epidemics.
The tool then produces key outcomes including expected numbers of deaths, hospitalizations and cases, with the possibility of simulating several scenarios of vaccine allocation at once for a side-by-side comparison.
ResultsWe provide two usage examples of Covid19Vaxplorer for vaccine allocation in Haiti and Afghanistan, which had as of Spring 2023 2% and 33% of their populations vaccinated, and show that for these particular examples, using available vaccine as primary series vaccinations prevents more deaths than using them as boosters.
Covid19Vaxplorer allows users in 183 regions in the world to compare several vaccination strategies simultaneously, adjusting parameters to their local epidemics, infrastructure and logistics.
Environmental predictors of malaria infection in Sussundenga, Mozambique  Malaria is highly sensitive to environmental conditions, including climate variability and land use practices.
Ecologically, Sussundenga district has a significantly lower elevation compared to the Zimbabwe border and a more tropical climate compared to southern and northern Mozambique due to high seasonal rainfall.
We aimed to evaluate the effects of climate and environmental factors at the household level on rapid diagnostic test results for Malaria in Sussundenga, Mozambique.
Additionally, we collected satellite data on day and night land surface temperatures and evapotranspiration which we assessed at 1- and 2-week lags.
We spatially and temporally joined these data with malaria infection data at the household level.
Using this database, we assessed whether these environmental factors were good predictors for having a positive rapid diagnostic test result using spatio-temporal models that accounted for the underlying correlation structure.
The results from modeling of the ecological predictors of malaria infection and spatial maps provided in this study could aid in developing frameworks to mitigate malaria transmission and predict future malaria transmission in this region.
Understanding how environmental changes impacts malaria transmission and infection at the household level may have important implications for vector control and disease surveillance strategies utilized by the district.
Characterising information loss due to aggregating epidemic model outputs  BackgroundCollaborative comparisons and combinations of epidemic models are used as policy-relevant evidence during epidemic outbreaks.
Typically, modellers contribute a probabilistic summary at each time-step.
MethodsWe compared July 2022 projections from the European COVID-19 Scenario Modelling Hub.
Five modelling teams projected incidence in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Spain.
We created a probabilistic ensemble drawn from all trajectories, and compared to ensembles from a median across each models quantiles, or a linear opinion pool.
We measured the predictive accuracy of individual trajectories against observations, using this in a weighted ensemble.
We repeated this sequentially against increasing weeks of observed data.
ResultsBy collecting modelled trajectories, we showed policy-relevant epidemic characteristics.
Trajectories contained a right-skewed distribution well represented by an ensemble of trajectories or a linear opinion pool, but not models quantile intervals.
Ensembles weighted by performance typically retained the range of plausible incidence over time, and in some cases narrowed this by excluding some epidemic shapes.
ConclusionsWe observed several information gains from collecting modelled trajectories rather than quantile distributions, including potential for continuously updated information from a single model collection.

Understanding the fine-scale heterogeneity and spatial drivers of malaria transmission using model-based geostatistical methods in Kenya  Malaria remains a public health concern.
Monitoring the fine-scale heterogeneity of the malaria burden enables more targeted control efforts.
Although malaria indicator surveys (MIS) have been crucial in evaluating the progress of malaria control interventions, they are only designed to provide a cross-sectional national and regional malaria disease burden.
Recent advances in geostatistical methods allow us to interpolate national survey data to describe subnational disease burden that is crucial in informing targeted control.
A binomial geostatistical model employing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) parameter estimation methods is used to understand the spatial drivers of malaria risk in Kenya and to predict malaria risk at a fine-scale resolution, including identifying hotspots.
A total of 11,549 children aged six months to 14 years from 207 clusters were sampled in this survey and used in the present analysis.
The national malaria prevalence based on the data was 8.4%, with the highest in the lake endemic zone (18.1 %) and the lowest in the low-risk zone (<1 %).
The analysis shows that elevation, proportion of ITN distributed, rainfall, temperature and urbanization covariates are all significant predictors of malaria transmission.
The 5x5 Km resolution maps show that malaria is heterogeneous in Kenya, with hotspot areas in the lake endemic area, the coastal areas, and some parts of the shores of Lake Turkana and Kajiado.
The high-resolution malaria prevalence maps produced as part of the analysis have shown that Kenya has additional malaria hotspots, especially in areas least expected.
These findings call for a rethinking of malaria burden classification in some regions for effective planning, implementation, resource mobilization, monitoring, and evaluation of malaria interventions in the country.
Analysis of the malaria profiles in high-risk incidence municipalities in the Brazilian Amazon using Principal Component Analysis in the period 2011-2013 and 2017-2019  BackgroundMalaria still is one of the most relevant infectious diseases in Brazil with 184,869 cases in 2019 and 62.8% of these cases occurred in only 6.2% of municipalities that had high transmission.
The incidence of malaria is influenced by environmental, socioeconomic, demographic, and structural factors (organization and effectiveness of health services, land use, and infrastructure).
MethodsWe use data from the Malaria Epidemiological Surveillance System aggregated by period and municipality, maintained by the Ministry of Health, from 2007 to 2019, and combine it with data from the National Institute for Space Researchs - Satellite Monitoring of Brazilian Amazon Forest Deforestation Project, 2010 Demographic Census Microdata and Registry of Health Establishments to analyze socioeconomic, demographic, environmental and health factors in two distinct periods.
We use the Principal Component Analysis algorithm to create different principal components characteristics patterns in high-risk municipalities.
ResultsThe Principal Component Analysis allowed the creation of three profiles of high-risk municipalities combining the contribution of different demographic, socioeconomic, environmental, and health characteristics with the contribution of the municipalities in each principal component.
The first group with a vulnerability profile, that is, high-risk municipalities with cases more associated with vulnerability characteristics, the second group is one with a profile of occupation and working age, of high-risk municipalities with cases more related to socioeconomic and demographic variables linked with specific occupations and a working-age population and the third group with municipalities that has a mixed profile associated with different characteristics related to of P. falciparum in contrast of P. vivax cases, such as the municipality of Rio Preto da Eva, which for the cases of P. vivax, may be more related to children under 5 years and differently, P. falciparum in this municipality could be more related to gold panning, deforestation and the presence of large bodies of water.

ConclusionsThere are particularities in socioeconomic, demographic, environmental, and health characteristics for infection by both types of Plasmodium and high-risk municipalities that become necessary to understand the differences in the profile of the population affected by malaria together with the environment in which they live, the weather, forest, hydrography and health conditions to assess the structure in these regions, in addition to analyzing the cases of P. falciparum separately from the cases of P. vivax, showing us that understand the socio-environmental determinants at the local level is essential for the success of malaria prevention and control strategies.

Two Decades of Endemic Dengue in Bangladesh (2000-2022): Trends, Seasonality, and impact of Temperature and Rainfall Patterns on transmission dynamics  BackgroundThe objectives of this study were to compare the dengue virus (DENV) infection, deaths, case-fatality ratio, as well as meteorological parameters between the first and and the recent decade (2000-2010 vs. 2011-2022) and to understand the trends, seasonality, and impact of change of temperature and rainfall pattern on transmission dynamics of Dengue in Bangladesh  MethodsFor the period 2000-2022, dengue cases and death data from Bangladeshs Ministry of Health and Family Welfares website, and meteorological data from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department were analyzed.
Mann-Kendall and Sens slop tests were used for trends and variations and fitted a time series Poisson regression model to identify the impact of meteorological parameters on the incidence of dengue cases.
A forecast of dengue cases was performed using an autoregressive integrated moving average model.
ResultsOver the past 22 years, a total of 244,246 dengue cases were reported including 849 deaths (Case fatality ratio [CFR] =0.34%).
The mean annual number of dengue cases increased eight-fold during the second decade, with 2216 cases during 2000-2011 vs. 18,321 during 2012-2022.
The mean annual deaths have doubled (21 vs. 46) although the overall CFR had decreased to one-third (0.69 vs 0.24).
Between the periods, the annual temperature increased by 0.49 {degrees}C, and rainfall decreased by 314 mm despite increasing unusual rainfall in the pre-and-post monsoon period.
An increasing trend of dengue cases is observed with a much stiffer rise after 2018.
Monthly mean temperature (Incidence risk ratio [IRR]: 1.26), first-lagged rainfall (IRR: 1.08), and second-lagged rainfall (IRR: 1.17) were significantly associated with monthly dengue incidence.
ConclusionsThe increased local temperature and unusual rainfall might have contributed to the increased incidence of DENV infection in Bangladesh.
Community engagement, vector control, and destruction of mosquito habitats are key to controlling dengue.
Impact of four years of annually repeated indoor residual spraying (IRS) with Actellic 300CS on routinely reported malaria cases in an agricultural setting in Malawi  Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is one of the main vector control tools used in malaria prevention.
This study evaluates IRS in the context of a privately run campaign conducted across a low-lying, irrigated, sugarcane estate from Illovo Sugar, in the Chikwawa district of Malawi.
The effect of Actellic 300CS annual spraying over four years (2015-2018) was assessed using a negative binomial mixed effects model, in an area where pyrethroid resistance has previously been identified.
With an unadjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 0.38 (95% CI: 0.32 - 0.45) and an adjusted IRR of 0.50 (95% CI: 0.42-0.59), IRS has significantly contributed to a reduction in case incidence rates at Illovo, as compared to control clinics and time points outside of the six month protective period.
More research is needed on the duration and timing of IRS programmes.
Effect of household use of multiple micronutrient-fortified bouillon on micronutrient status among women and children in two districts in the Northern Region of Ghana: Protocol for the Condiment Micronutrient Innovation Trial (CoMIT), a community-based randomized controlled trial  IntroductionMicronutrient deficiencies are prevalent in West Africa, particularly among women of reproductive age (WRA) and young children.
Bouillon is a promising food fortification vehicle due to its widespread consumption.
This study aims to evaluate the impact of multiple micronutrient-fortified bouillon cubes, compared to control bouillon cubes (fortified with iodine only), on micronutrient status and hemoglobin concentrations among lactating and non-lactating WRA and young children in northern Ghana.
MethodsThis randomized, controlled doubly-masked trial will be conducted in the Kumbungu and Tolon districts in the Northern Region of Ghana, where prior data indicate multiple micronutrient deficiencies are common.
Participants will be: 1) non-pregnant non-lactating WRA (15-49 y), 2) children 2-5 y, and 3) non-pregnant lactating women 4-18 months postpartum.
Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive household rations of one of two types of bouillon cubes: 1) a multiple micronutrient-fortified bouillon cube containing vitamin A, folic acid, vitamin B12, iron, zinc, and iodine, or 2) a control cube containing iodine only.
Each participants household will receive a ration of bouillon cubes every 2 weeks, and households will be advised to prepare meals as usual, using the study-provided cubes.
The trial duration will be 9 months for non-pregnant non-lactating WRA and children, and 3 months for lactating women.
Secondary outcomes will include change in prevalence of micronutrient deficiency and anemia; dietary intake of bouillon and micronutrients; inflammation, malaria, and morbidity symptoms; and child growth and development.
Are viral loads in the febrile phase a predictive factor of dengue disease severity?
BackgroundAs many studies have shown conflicting results regarding the extent of viraemia and clinical disease severity, we sought to investigate if viraemia during early dengue illness is associated with subsequent clinical disease severity.
Methodology/Principal Findings424 adult patients, in whom the dengue virus (DENV) serotype could be identified, who presented within the first 4 days of illness, were recruited from a tertiary care hospital from Sri Lanka from September 2016 to September 2022 following informed written consent.
To characterize subsequent clinical disease severity, all patients were followed throughout their illness daily and disease severity classified according to WHO 1997 and 2009 disease classification.
315 patients had DF, 109 progressed to develop DHF and of those 17 developed shock (DSS).
Although the viral loads were higher in the febrile phase in patients who progressed to develop DHF than in patients with DF this was not significant (p=0.15).
Significant differences were observed in viral loads in patients infected with different DENV serotypes (p=0.0001), with patients infected with DENV2 having the lowest viral loads and the highest viral loads in DENV1.
Although those infected with DENV2 had lower viral loads, infection with DENV2 was significantly associated with a higher risk of developing DHF (p=0.016, Odds ratio 1.8; 95% CI 1.116 to 2.905).
Based on the WHO 2009 disease classification, 268 had dengue with warning signs (DWW), 139 dengue without warning signs (DWoWS), and 17 had severe dengue (SD).
No significant difference was observed in the viral loads between those with SD, DWW and DWoWS (p=0.34).
Conclusions/SignificanceViral loads in the febrile phase do not appear to significantly associate with subsequent clinical disease severity in a large Sri Lankan cohort.
Author summaryAs many studies have shown conflicting results regarding the extent of viraemia and clinical disease severity, we sought to investigate if viraemia during early dengue illness was associated with subsequent clinical disease severity.
We assessed the viral loads and subsequent clinical disease severity in 424 patients, during early illness, to determine if viral loads associate with disease subsequent disease severity.
Although the viral loads were higher in early illness in patients who progressed to develop dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) than in patients with dengue fever, this was not significant.
Significant differences were observed in viral loads in patients infected with different DENV serotypes, with patients infected with DENV2 having the lowest viral loads and the highest viral loads in DENV1.
Although those infected with DENV2 had lower viral loads, infection with DENV2 was significantly associated with a higher risk of developing DHF.
Therefore, viral loads in early illness, do not appear to strongly associate with subsequent clinical disease severity in this Sri Lankan cohort.
LLIN Evaluation in Uganda Project (LLINEUP) - Plasmodium infection prevalence and genotypic markers of insecticide resistance in Anopheles vectors from 48 districts of Uganda  BackgroundIn 2017-2019, we conducted a large-scale, cluster-randomised trial (LLINEUP) to evaluate long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) treated with a pyrethroid insecticide plus the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO LLINs), as compared to conventional, pyrethroid-only LLINs across 104 health sub-districts (HSDs) in Uganda.
In LLINEUP, and similar trials in Tanzania, PBO LLINs were found to provide greater protection against malaria than conventional LLINs, reducing parasitaemia and vector density.
In the LLINEUP trial, cross-sectional entomological surveys were carried out at baseline and then every 6 months for two years.
In each survey, ten households per HSD were randomly selected for indoor household entomological collections.
ResultsOverall, 5395 female Anopheles mosquitoes were collected from 5046 households.
The proportion of mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium falciparum did not change significantly over time, while infection with non-falciparum malaria decreased in An.
gambiae s.s, but not An.
The frequency of genetic markers associated with pyrethroid resistance increased significantly over time, but the rate of change was not different between the two LLIN types.
The knock-down resistance (kdr) mutation Vgsc-995S declined over time as Vgsc-995F, the alternative resistance mutation at this codon, increased.
Vgsc-995F appears to be spreading into Uganda.
ConclusionsDistribution of LLINs in Uganda was associated with reductions in parasite prevalence and vector density, but the proportion of infective mosquitoes remained stable, suggesting that the potential for transmission persisted.
The increased frequency of markers of pyrethroid resistance indicates that LLIN distribution favoured the evolution of resistance within local vectors and highlights the potential benefits of resistance management strategies.

Updating estimates of Plasmodium knowlesi malaria risk in response to changing land use patterns across Southeast Asia  BackgroundPlasmodium knowlesi is a zoonotic parasite that causes malaria in humans.
The pathogen has a natural host reservoir in certain macaque species and is transmitted to humans via mosquitoes of the Anopheles Leucosphyrus Group.
The risk of human P. knowlesi infection varies across Southeast Asia and is dependent upon environmental factors.
Understanding this geographic variation in risk is important both for enabling appropriate diagnosis and treatment of the disease and for improving the planning and evaluation of malaria elimination.
However, the data available on P. knowlesi occurrence are biased towards regions with greater surveillance and sampling effort.
Predicting the spatial variation in risk of P. knowlesi malaria requires methods that can both incorporate environmental risk factors and account for spatial bias in detection.
Methods & ResultsWe extend and apply an environmental niche modelling framework as implemented by a previous mapping study of P. knowlesi transmission risk which included data up to 2015.
We reviewed the literature from October 2015 through to March 2020 and identified 264 new records of P. knowlesi, with a total of 524 occurrences included in the current study following consolidation with the 2015 study.
The modelling framework used in the 2015 study was extended, with changes including the addition of new covariates to capture the effect of deforestation and urbanisation on P. knowlesi transmission.
DiscussionOur map of P. knowlesi relative transmission suitability estimates that the risk posed by the pathogen is highest in Malaysia and Indonesia, with localised areas of high risk also predicted in the Greater Mekong Subregion, The Philippines and Northeast India.
These results highlight areas of priority for P. knowlesi surveillance and prospective sampling to address the challenge the disease poses to malaria elimination planning.
Author SummaryPlasmodium knowlesi is a parasite that can cause malaria when it infects humans.
Although most people do not experience severe illness from Plasmodium knowlesi infection, a small number will develop serious or even fatal disease.
The parasite is found naturally in some monkeys throughout Southeast Asia, and spreads from these monkeys to humans through mosquitoes.
Previous research predicted where the risk of being infected is highest according to what we know about the environment across Southeast Asia, such as if there are forests in an area or if the altitude is high.
In this work, we extend this previous research with more up-to-date data on environmental conditions and infections to predict the risk of being infected with Plasmodium knowlesi.
We show that the risk Plasmodium knowlesi poses to humans is high across much of Southeast Asia, and that the disease will continue to challenge national goals to eliminate malaria.
Current and lagged associations of meteorological variables and Aedes mosquito indices with dengue incidence in the Philippines  BackgroundDengue is an increasing health burden that has spread throughout the tropics and sub-tropics.
There is currently no effective vaccine and control is only possible through integrated vector management.
Early warning systems to alert potential dengue outbreaks are currently being explored but despite showing promise are yet to come to fruition.
This study addresses the use of meteorological variables for predicting both entomological indices and dengue incidences and assesses the added value of additionally using entomological indices for predicting dengue incidences.
Methodology/Principal FindingsEntomological surveys were carried out monthly for 14 months in six sites spread across three environmentally different cities of the Philippines.
Meteorological and dengue data were acquired.
Non-linear generalized additive models were fitted to test associations with the meteorological variables and both entomological indices and dengue cases.
Rain and the diurnal temperature range (DTR) contributed most to explaining the variation in both entomological indices and number of dengue cases.
DTR and minimum temperature also explained variation in dengue cases occurring one and two months later.
The number of adult mosquitoes did associate with the number of dengue cases, but contributed no additional value for predicting dengue cases.
Conclusions/SignificanceThe use of meteorological variables to predict future risk of dengue holds promise.
The lack of added value of using entomological indices confirms several previous studies and given the onerous nature of obtaining such information, more effort should be placed on improving meteorological information at a finer scale to evaluate efficacy in early warning of dengue outbreaks.
Author summaryDengue is a widespread mosquito-borne disease.
Mosquitoes are sensitive to temperature and rainfall and hence there have been efforts to identify such variables for predicting dengue outbreaks.
Several mosquito indices are measured routinely by national surveillance systems, but which vary considerably in their success of predicting dengue outbreaks.
This study explored the current and lagged associations of meteorological variables with mosquito indices and dengue incidence.
Associations of mosquito indices with dengue were also explored.
Rain and the diurnal temperature range (DTR) contributed most to explaining the variation in both entomological indices and number of dengue cases.
DTR and minimum temperature also explained variation in dengue cases occurring one and two months later.
Mosquito indices did not provide any additional predictive power of dengue incidences.
Given the onerous nature of measuring mosquito indices, advanced warning systems might be improved using meteorological variables measured at finer scales than that traditionally available.
Analytic optimization of Plasmodium falciparum marker gene haplotype recovery from amplicon deep sequencing of complex mixtures  Molecular epidemiologic studies of malaria parasites commonly employ amplicon deep sequencing (AmpSeq) of marker genes derived from dried blood spots (DBS) to answer public health questions related to topics such as transmission and drug resistance.
As these methods are increasingly employed to inform direct public health action, it is important to rigorously evaluate the risk of false positive and false negative haplotypes derived from clinically-relevant sample types.
We performed a control experiment evaluating haplotype recovery from AmpSeq of 5 marker genes (ama1, csp, msp7, sera2, and trap) from DBS containing mixtures of DNA from 1 to 10 known P. falciparum reference strains across 3 parasite densities in triplicate (n=270 samples).
While false positive haplotypes were present across all parasite densities and mixtures, we optimized censoring criteria to remove 83% (148/179) of false positives while removing only 8% (67/859) of true positives.
Post-censoring, the median pairwise Jaccard distance between replicates was 0.83.
We failed to recover 35% (477/1365) of haplotypes expected to be present in the sample.
Haplotypes were more likely to be missed in low-density samples with <1.5 genomes/{micro}L (OR: 3.88, CI: 1.82-8.27, vs. high-density samples with [&ge;]75 genomes/{micro}L) and in samples with lower read depth (OR per 10,000 reads: 0.61, CI: 0.54-0.69).
Furthermore, minority haplotypes within a sample were more likely to be missed than dominant haplotypes (OR per 0.01 increase in proportion: 0.96, CI: 0.96-0.97).
Finally, in clinical samples the percent concordance across markers for multiplicity of infection ranged from 40%-80%.
Taken together, our observations indicate that, with sufficient read depth, haplotypes can be successfully recovered from DBS while limiting the false positive rate.
The impact of climate change and natural climate variability on the global distribution of Aedes aegypti  Aedes aegypti spread pathogens affecting humans, including the dengue, Zika and yellow fever viruses.
Anthropogenic climate change is altering the spatial distribution of Ae.
aegypti and therefore the locations at risk of vector-borne disease.
In addition to climate change, natural climate variability, resulting from internal atmospheric processes and interactions between climate system components (e.g.
atmosphere-land, atmosphere-ocean) determines climate outcomes.
However, the combined effects of climate change and natural climate variability on future Ae.
aegypti spread have not been assessed fully.
We developed an ecological model in which Ae.
aegypti population dynamics depend on climate variables (temperature and rainfall).
We used 100 projections from the Community Earth System Model, a comprehensive climate model that simulates natural climate variability as well as anthropogenic climate change, in combination with our ecological model to generate a range of equally plausible scenarios describing the global distribution of suitable conditions for Ae.
aegypti up to 2100.
Like other studies, we project the poleward expansion of Ae.
For example, by 2100, climatic conditions in London may be suitable for Ae.
aegypti for between one and five months in the year, depending on natural climate variability.
Our results demonstrate that natural climate variability yields different possible future Ae.
aegypti spread scenarios.
This affects vector-borne disease risks, including the potential for some regions to experience outbreaks earlier than expected under climate change alone.

Investigating a causal role for neutrophil count on P. falciparum severe malaria: a Mendelian Randomization study  BackgroundMalaria caused by P. falciparum imposes a tremendous public health burden on people living in sub-Saharan Africa.
Severe malaria is associated with high morbidity and mortality and results from complications such as cerebral malaria, severe anaemia or respiratory distress.
Individuals living in malaria endemic regions often have a reduced circulating neutrophil count due to a heritable phenomenon called  benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN).
Neutrophils defend against bacterial infections but have been shown to be detrimental in pre-clinical malaria models, raising the possibility that reduced neutrophil counts modulate severity of malaria in susceptible populations.
We tested this hypothesis by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of circulating neutrophil count and a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis of neutrophil counts on severe malaria in individuals of predominantly African ancestry.
ResultsWe carried out a GWAS of neutrophil count in individuals associated to an African continental ancestry group within UK Biobank (N=5,976).
We identified previously unknown loci regulating neutrophil count in a non-European population.
This was followed by a two-sample bi-directional MR analysis between neutrophil count and severe malaria (MalariaGEN, N=17,056).
We identified 73 loci (r2=0.1) associated with neutrophil count, including the well-known rs2814778 variant responsible for BEN.
The greatest evidence for an effect was found between neutrophil count and severe anaemia, although the confidence intervals crossed the null.
MR analyses failed to suggest evidence for an effect of the combined severe malaria syndromes or individual subtypes (severe malaria anaemia, cerebral malaria, other severe malaria) on neutrophil count.
ConclusionOur GWAS of neutrophil count revealed unique loci present in individuals of African ancestry.
We note that a small sample-size reduced our power to identify variants with low allele frequencies and/or low effect sizes in our GWAS.
Our work highlights the need for conducting large-scale biobank studies in Africa and for further exploring the link between neutrophils and severe malarial anemia.
Malaria trends in districts that were targeted and not-targeted for seasonal malaria chemoprevention in children under five years of age in Guinea, 2014 - 2021  BackgroundSeasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) is one of the main interventions recommended by WHO to prevent and reduce childhood malaria.
Since 2015, Guinea has implemented SMC targeting children aged 3-59 months (CU5) in districts with high and seasonal malaria transmission.
ObjectiveWe assessed the programmatic impact of SMC in Guineas context of scaled-up malaria intervention programming by comparing malaria-related outcomes in 14 districts that had (n = 8) or had not (n = 6) been targeted for SMC.
MethodUsing routine health management information system data, we calculated the district-level monthly test positivity rate (TPR) and monthly uncomplicated and severe malaria incidence for the whole population and disaggregated age groups (<5yrs and [&ge;]5yrs of age).
Changes in malaria indicators through time were analyzed by calculating the district-level compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2014 to 2021; we used statistical analyses to describe the time trend of the number of tested clinical cases, TPR, uncomplicated malaria incidence, and severe malaria incidence.
ResultThe CAGR of TPR of all age groups was statistically lower in SMC (median = -7.8%, range [IQR] = -9.7%, -5.5%) compared to non-SMC (median = -3.0%, IQR = -3.0%, -1.2%) districts.
Similarly, the CAGR in uncomplicated malaria incidence was significantly lower in SMC (median = 1.8%, IQR = -0.9%, 3.5%) compared to non-SMC (median = 11.5%, IQR = 8.8%, 14.0%) districts.
For both TPR and uncomplicated malaria incidence the observed difference was also significant age disaggregated.
The CAGR of severe malaria incidence showed that all age groups experienced a decline in severe malaria in both SMC and non-SMC districts.
However, this decline was significantly higher in SMC (median = -22.3%, IQR= -27.6%, -18.2%) than in non-SMC (median = -5.1%, IQR= - 7.7; -3.6) districts for the entire population, as well as both CU5 and people over 5 years of age.
ConclusionOur results provide evidence to support that--even in an operational programming context--adding SMC to the comprehensive package of malaria interventions yields a positive epidemiological impact and results in greater reduction in TPR, as well as the incidence of uncomplicated and severe malaria in CU5.
Circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and co-infection with Plasmodium falciparum in Equatorial Guinea  The impact of COVID-19 in Africa has been a big concern since the beginning of the pandemic.
However, low incidence of COVID-19 case severity and mortality has been reported in many African countries, although data are highly heterogeneous and, in some regions, like Sub-Saharan Africa, very scarce.
Many of these regions are also the cradle of endemic infectious diseases like malaria.
The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, the diversity and origin of circulating variants as well as the frequency of co-infections with malaria in Equatorial Guinea.
For this purpose, we conducted antigen diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, and microscopy examinations for malaria of 1,556 volunteers at six health centres in Bioko and Bata from June to October 2021.
Nasopharyngeal swab samples were also taken for molecular detection of SARS-COV-2 by RT-qPCR and whole genome viral sequencing.
We report 3.0% of SARS-CoV-2 and 24.4% of malaria prevalence over the sampling in Equatorial Guinea.
SARS-CoV-2 cases were found at a similar frequency in all age groups, whereas the age groups most frequently affected by malaria were children (36.8% [95% CI 30.9-42.7]) and teenagers (34.7% [95% CI 29.5-39.9]).
We found six cases of confirmed co-infection of malaria and SARS-CoV-2 distributed among all age groups, representing a 0.4% frequency of co-infection in the whole sampled population.
Interestingly, the majority of malaria and SARS-CoV-2 co-infections were mild.
We obtained the genome sequences of 43 SARS-CoV-2 isolates, most of which belong to the lineage Delta (AY.43) and that according to our pandemic-scale phylogenies were introduced from Europe in multiple occasions (7 transmission groups and 17 unique introductions).
This study is relevant in providing first-time estimates of the actual prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in this malaria-endemic country, with the identification of circulating variants, their origin, and the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 and malaria co-infection.
A cluster-randomized trial of client and provider-directed financial interventions to align incentives with appropriate case management in retail medicine outlets: results of the TESTsmART Trial in western Kenya  ACTs are responsible for a substantial proportion of the global reduction in malaria mortality over the last ten years.
However, inexpensive ACTs available in retail outlets have contributed substantially to their overconsumption.
We supportead point-of-care malaria testing (mRDTs) in 39 retail medicine outlets in western Kenya and randomized them to three study arms; control arm offering subsidized RDT testing for 0.4USD, client-directed intervention where all clients who received a positive RDT at the outlet were eligible for a free (fully subsidized) first-line ACT, and a combined client and provider directed intervention where clients with a positive RDT were eligible for free ACT and outlets received 0.1USD for every RDT performed.
Our primary outcome was the proportion of ACT dispensed to individuals with a positive diagnostic test.
Secondary outcomes included proportion of clients tested at the outlet and adherence to diagnostic test results.
43% of clients chose to test at the outlet.
Test results informed treatment decisions and resulted in targeting of ACTs to confirmed malaria cases - 25.3% of test-negative clients purchased an ACT compared to 75% of untested clients.
Client-directed and client+provider-directed interventions did not offer further improvements, compared to the control arm, in testing rates (RD=0.09, 95%CI:-0.08,0.26) or dispensing of ACTs to test-positive clients (RD=0.01,95% CI:-0.14, 0.16).
We conclude that mRDTs could reduce ACT overconsumption in the private retail sector, but incentive structures are difficult to scale and their value to private providers is uncertain.
Targeted malaria elimination interventions reduce Plasmodium falciparum infections up to 3 kilometers away  Malaria elimination interventions in low-transmission settings aim to extinguish hot spots and prevent transmission to nearby areas.
In malaria elimination settings, the World Health Organization recommends reactive, focal interventions targeted to the area near malaria cases shortly after they are detected.
A key question is whether these interventions reduce transmission to nearby uninfected or asymptomatic individuals who did not receive interventions.
Here, we measured direct effects (among intervention recipients) and spillover effects (among non-recipients) of reactive, focal interventions delivered within 500m of confirmed malaria index cases in a cluster-randomized trial in Namibia.
The trial delivered malaria chemoprevention (artemether lumefantrine) and vector control (indoor residual spraying with Actellic) separately and in combination using a factorial design.
We compared incidence, infection prevalence, and seroprevalence between study arms among intervention recipients (direct effects) and non-recipients (spillover effects) up to 3 km away from index cases.
We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios accounting for spillover effects.
The combined chemoprevention and vector control intervention produced direct effects and spillover effects.
In the primary analysis among non-recipients within 1 km from index cases, the combined intervention reduced malaria incidence by 43% (95% CI 20%, 59%).
In secondary analyses among non-recipients 500m-3 km from interventions, the combined intervention reduced infection by 79% (6%, 95%) and seroprevalence 34% (20%, 45%).
Accounting for spillover effects increased the cost-effectiveness of the combined intervention by 37%.
Our findings provide the first evidence that targeting hot spots with combined chemoprevention and vector control interventions can indirectly benefit non-recipients up to 3 km away.
Significance StatementIn settings where malaria transmission is declining and approaching elimination, new malaria cases are clustered in space and time.
Prior studies have found that targeting prophylactic antimalarial drugs and vector control in the area around newly detected malaria cases reduced community-wide malaria.
Here, we found that when antimalarials and vector control were delivered as a combined strategy in the area near recent cases, malaria incidence was reduced up to 3 kilometers away among individuals who did not receive interventions.
Overall, our findings suggest that combined, targeted malaria interventions can reduce local transmission and support their use for malaria elimination.
Food fraud: insights from investigating a near-fatal poisoning with global implications  Risks of food fraud have been exacerbated by ongoing supply-chain shortages and reduced regulatory oversight caused by the COVID19 pandemic.
Since food fraud cases involve adulterants that are deliberately disguised, resulting poisonings are especially difficult to investigate and treat.
We encountered a near-fatal poisoning with "weight-loss candlenuts" that are readily available online.
We leveraged state-of-the-art high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and discovered that commonly used spectral libraries and toxin/poison standards panels do not contain the materials needed to identify the causative agents of this nearly lethal poisoning.
By building new methods, we ultimately found  Nuez de la India contain high levels of uncommon cardiac glycosides, while deploying HRMS as a novel  chemical fingerprinting tool revealed them to be mislabeled yellow oleander seeds.
Our work presents a rapid investigative strategy to empower future investigations, and provides guiding principles to food safety programs for treating, and indeed preventing, these potentially fatal poisonings that are increasing worldwide.
Asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum Carriage at the End of the Dry Season is Associated with Subsequent Infection and Clinical Malaria in Eastern Gambia  BackgroundChronic carriage of asymptomatic low-density Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia in the dry season may support maintenance of acquired immunity that protects against clinical malaria.
However, the relationship between chronic low-density infections and subsequent risk of clinical malaria episodes remains unclear.
MethodsIn a 2-years study (December 2014 to December 2016) in eastern Gambia, nine cross-sectional surveys using molecular parasite detection were performed in the dry and wet season.
During the 2016 malaria transmission season, passive case detection identified episodes of clinical malaria.
ResultsAmong the 5,256 samples collected, 444 (8.4%) were positive for P. falciparum.
A multivariate model identified village of residence, male sex, age [&ge;]5 years old, anaemia, and fever as independent factors associated with P. falciparum parasite carriage.
Infections did not cluster over time within the same households or recurred among neighbouring households.
Asymptomatic parasite carriage at the end of dry season was associated with a higher risk of infection (Hazard Ratio, HR= 3.0, p< 0.0001) and clinical malaria (HR= 1.561, p= 0.057) during the following transmission season.
Age and village of residence were additional predictors of infection and clinical malaria during the transmission season.
ConclusionChronic parasite carriage during the dry season is associated with an increased risk of malaria infection and clinical malaria.
Association between insecticide-treated bed net use and Burkitt lymphoma incidence in children in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review and population-level analysis  BackgroundBurkitt lymphoma (BL) is one of the most common childhood cancers in sub-Saharan Africa and aetiologically linked to malaria.
However, evidence for an effect of malaria interventions on BL is limited.
The aim of this study was to investigate the potential population-level association between large-scale rollout of insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) in sub-Saharan Africa in the 2000s and BL incidence.
MethodsWe conducted a systematic review in Embase, Global Health and MEDLINE to assemble all available data on BL incidence rates in children aged 0-15 years in malaria-endemic sub-Saharan African countries between Jan 1, 1990 and Feb 27, 2023.
We calculated pooled estimates of BL incidence in sub-Saharan Africa for the time periods before and after ITN introduction.
We used model estimates of sub-national ITN use to assess the association between average population ITN use and childhood BL incidence rates in a negative binomial regression model.
ResultsWe included 23 studies comprising 66 datapoints on BL incidence based on 5,226 cancer cases from locations with large-scale ITN use in 17 countries.
BL rates were 44% (95% CI 12-64%) lower in the time period after ITN introduction compared to before.
The pooled incidence rate of BL was 1.36 (95% CI 0.88-2.10) and 0.76 (95% CI 0.50-1.16) per 100,000 person-years before and after introduction of ITNs, respectively.
After adjusting for potential confounders, a 1% increase in average ITN use in the population in the 10 years before BL data collection was associated with a 2% (95% CI 1-4%) reduction in BL incidence.
ConclusionThese findings suggest that large-scale rollout of ITNs in the 2000s was associated with a reduction in childhood BL burden in sub-Saharan Africa.
Although published data may not be representative of all incidence rates across sub-Saharan Africa, our study highlights a potential additional benefit of malaria control programmes.
Design and selection of drug properties to increase the public health impact of next-generation seasonal malaria chemoprevention: a modelling study  BackgroundSeasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) is recommended for disease control in settings with moderate to high Plasmodium falciparum transmission and currently depends on administration of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine with amodiaquine.
However, poor regimenadherence and the increasedfrequencyof sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistant parasite mutations may threaten SMCs effectiveness.
We need guidance to de-risk the development of drug compounds for malaria prevention.
MethodsWe combined an individual-based malaria transmission model that has explicit parasite growth with drug pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models.
Global sensitivity analyses identified trade-offs between drug elimination half-life, maximum killing effect, and SMC coverage, and optimisation identified minimum requirements to maximise malaria burden reductions.
FindingsModel predictions show that preventing infection for the entire period between SMC cycles is more important than drug curative efficacy for clinical disease effectiveness outcomes, but similarly important for impact on prevalence.
When four SMC cycles are deployed to children under five years with high levels of coverage (69% of children receiving all cycles), drug candidates require a duration of protection half-life of >23 days (elimination half-life >10 days) to achieve >75% clinical incidence and severe disease reductions (measured over the intervention period in the target population, compared with no intervention across a range of modelled scenarios).
High coverage is critical to achieve these targets, requiring >60% of children received all SMC cycles and >90% of children at least one cycle regardless of the drugs duration.
InterpretationWhile efficacy is crucial for malaria prevalence reductions, chemoprevention development should select drug candidates for their duration of protection to maximise burden reductions, with the duration half-life determiningcycle timing.
Dengue Viremia Kinetics and Effects on Platelet Count and Clinical Outcomes: An Analysis of 2340 Patients from Vietnam  BackgroundViremia is a critical factor in understanding the pathogenesis of dengue infection, but limited data exist on viremia kinetics.
This study aimed to investigate the kinetics of viremia and its effects on subsequent platelet count, severe dengue, and plasma leakage.
MethodsWe pooled data from three studies conducted in Vietnam between 2000 and 2016, involving 2340 dengue patients with daily viremia measurements and platelet counts after symptom onset.
Viremia kinetics were assessed using a random effects model that accounted for left-censored data.
The effects of viremia on subsequent platelet count and clinical outcomes were examined using a landmark approach with a random effects model and logistic regression model with generalized estimating equations, respectively.
The rate of viremia decline was derived from the model of viremia kinetics.
ResultsViremia levels rapidly decreased following symptom onset, with variations observed depending on the infecting serotype.
DENV-1 exhibited the highest mean viremia levels during the first 5-6 days, while DENV-4 demonstrated the shortest clearance time.
Higher viremia levels were associated with decreased subsequent platelet counts from day 6 onwards.
Elevated viremia levels on each illness day increased the risk of developing severe dengue and plasma leakage.
However, the effect size decreased with later illness days.
A more rapid decline in viremia is associated with a reduced risk of the clinical outcomes.
ConclusionsThis study provides comprehensive insights into viremia kinetics and its effect on subsequent platelet count and clinical outcomes in dengue patients.
Our findings underscore the importance of measuring viremia levels during the early febrile phase for dengue studies and support the use of viremia kinetics as outcome for phase-2 dengue therapeutic trials.
Exploring the Accuracy of Differentiation-Based Regressive Models in Disease Forecasting  Predictive models have been able to foresee outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and map Ebola outbreaks1.
It can therefore be assumed that predictive analytics can reduce the amount of economic and non-economic burden caused by other epidemics as well, with COVID-19 being an obvious example.
Model-based cost-effectiveness analysis of a multiplex lateral flow rapid diagnostic test for acute non-malarial febrile illness in rural South and Southeast Asian primary care  BackgroundMultiplex lateral flow rapid diagnostic tests (LF-RDTs) may aid management of patients with acute non-malarial fever (NMFI) in rural South and Southeast Asia.
We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness in Cambodia and Bangladesh of a putative, as-yet-undeveloped LF-RDT capable of diagnosing enteric fever and dengue, as well as measuring C-reactive protein (CRP) to guide antibiotic prescription, in primary care patients with acute NMFI.
MethodsA country-specific decision tree model-based cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from a health system plus limited societal perspective considering the cost of antimicrobial resistance.
Parameters were based on data from a large observational study on the regional epidemiology of acute febrile illness, published studies, and procurement price lists.
Costs were expressed in 2022 US dollars, and cost-effectiveness evaluated by comparing incremental cost-effectiveness ratios with conservative opportunity cost-based willingness-to-pay thresholds and the more widely used threshold of per capita GDP.
FindingsCompared to standard of care, LF-RDT-augmented clinical assessment was dominant in Cambodia, being more effective and cost-saving.
The cost per DALY averted in Bangladesh was $482, slightly above the conservative opportunity cost-based willingness-to-pay threshold of $388 and considerably lower than the GDP-based threshold of $2,687.
The intervention remained dominant in Cambodia and well below the GDP-based threshold in Bangladesh when antimicrobial resistance costs were disregarded.
InterpretationThese findings provide guidance for academic, industry, and policymaker stakeholders involved in acute NMFI diagnostics.
RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe diagnosis and management of acute non-malarial febrile illness in rural South and Southeast Asian low- and middle-income countries remains challenging; multiplex lateral flow rapid diagnostic tests have been proposed as a possible solution.
In view of the scant evidence on the epidemiology of acute non-malarial febrile illness in this region, we recently conducted an international Delphi survey to identify priority analytes for inclusion in such a putative test with capillary blood as the substrate.
The main finding was that this test should be able to diagnose enteric fever and dengue, at a minimum; there was also support for including C-reactive protein as a means of differentiating viral from non-viral causes of NMFI to guide empirical antibiotic prescribing.
However, we could not identify any economic evaluations of the cost-effectiveness of any such multiplex tests following a search of standard databases using the keywords  fever,  febrile,  multiplex,  South Asia and  Southeast Asia on 2 March 2023.
Implications of all the available evidenceThe cost-effectiveness of this putative multiplex lateral flow rapid diagnostic test is dependent not only on its inherent performance and pricing, but on context-specific factors.
Histomorphometric features of placentae from women having malaria and HIV coinfection with preterm births  BackgroundMalaria and HIV are associated with preterm births possibly due to partial maternal vascular malperfusion resulting from altered placental angiogenesis.
There is a paucity of data describing structural changes associated with malaria and HIV coinfection in the placentae of preterm births thus limiting the understanding of biological mechanisms by which preterm birth occurs.
ObjectivesThis study aimed to determine the differences in clinical characteristics, placental parenchymal histological, and morphometric features of the terminal villous tree among women with malaria and HIV coinfection having preterm births.
MethodsTwenty-five placentae of preterm births with malaria and HIV coinfection (cases) were randomly selected and compared to twenty-five of those without both infections (controls).
Light microscopy was used to determine histological features on H&E and MT-stained sections while histomorphometric features of the terminal villous were analyzed using image analysis software.
Clinical data regarding maternal age, parity, marital status, level of education, gestational age and placental weight were compared.
ResultsPlacental weight, villous perimeter and area were significantly lower in cases as compared to controls 454g vs. 488g, 119.32{micro}m vs. 130.47{micro}m, and 937.93{micro}m2 vs. 1132.88{micro}m2 respectively.
ResultsPlacental weight, villous perimeter and area were significantly lower in cases as compared to controls 454g vs. 488g, 119.32{micro}m vs. 130.47{micro}m, and 937.93{micro}m2 vs. 1132.88{micro}m2 respectively.
ResultsPlacental weight, villous perimeter and area were significantly lower in cases as compared to controls 454g vs. 488g, 119.32{micro}m vs. 130.47{micro}m, and 937.93{micro}m2 vs. 1132.88{micro}m2 respectively.
ResultsPlacental weight, villous perimeter and area were significantly lower in cases as compared to controls 454g vs. 488g, 119.32{micro}m vs. 130.47{micro}m, and 937.93{micro}m2 vs. 1132.88{micro}m2 respectively.
Increased syncytial knots and accelerated villous maturity were significantly increased in the cases.
The relative risk of development of partial maternal vascular malperfusion was 2.1 (CI: 1.26-3.49).
ConclusionThese findings suggest that malaria and HIV coinfection leads to partial maternal vascular malperfusion that may lead to chronic hypoxia in the placenta and altered weight, villous perimeter and surface area.
This may represent a mechanism by which malaria and HIV infection results in pre-term births.
A novel duplex qualitative real-time PCR assay for the detection and differentiation of Plasmodium ovale curtisi and Plasmodium ovale wallikeri malaria  BackgroundP.
ovale spp.
infections are endemic across multiple African countries and are caused by two distinct non-recombining species, P. ovale curtisi (Poc) and P. ovale wallikeri (Pow).
infections are endemic across multiple African countries and are caused by two distinct non-recombining species, P. ovale curtisi (Poc) and P. ovale wallikeri (Pow).
In this study, we developed a new duplex assay for the detection and differentiation of Poc and Pow that can be used to improve our understanding of these parasites.
MethodsRepetitive sequence motifs were identified in available Poc and Pow genomes and used for assay development and validation.
We evaluated the analytical sensitivity and specificity of the best-performing assay using a panel of samples from Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), then validated its performance using 55 P. ovale spp.
samples and 40 non-ovale Plasmodium samples from the DRC.
Poc and Pow prevalence among symptomatic individuals sampled across three provinces of the DRC were estimated.
ResultsThe best-performing Poc and Pow targets had 9 and 8 copies within the reference genomes, respectively.
Our duplex assay had 100% specificity and 95% confidence lower limits of detection of 4.2 and 41.2 parasite genome equivalents/{micro}l for Poc and Pow, respectively.
Species was determined in 80% of all P. ovale spp.-positive field samples and 100% of those with >10 parasites/{micro}l. Most P. ovale spp.
Species was determined in 80% of all P. ovale spp.-positive field samples and 100% of those with >10 parasites/{micro}l. Most P. ovale spp.

Species was determined in 80% of all P. ovale spp.-positive field samples and 100% of those with >10 parasites/{micro}l. Most P. ovale spp.
field samples from the DRC were found to be Poc infections.
ConclusionsWe identified promising multi-copy targets for molecular detection and differentiation of Poc and Pow and used them to develop a new duplex real-time PCR assay that performed well when applied to diverse field samples.
Though low-density Pow infections are not reliably detected, the assay is highly specific and can be used for high-throughput studies of P. ovale spp.
epidemiology among symptomatic cases in malaria-endemic countries like the DRC.
Author SummaryNon-falciparum malaria is gaining attention, especially in settings where P. falciparum transmission is declining.
Plasmodium ovale curtisi (Poc) and wallikeri (Pow) are neglected parasites that can cause relapsing malaria and are thought to differ in clinical symptomatology and latency.
However, existing diagnostic assays have limited ability to detect and distinguish Poc and Pow and are not well-suited for high-throughput use, hindering our understanding of P. ovale spp.
Mining recently available Poc and Pow reference genomes, we identify new multi-copy targets for molecular detection and develop a novel duplex qualitative real-time PCR assay capable of species differentiation.
The assay is highly specific and requires short turn-around time.
While sensitivity can be improved for low-density Pow infections, this new assay can be used for high-throughput studies of symptomatic P. ovale spp.
infections in malaria-endemic countries.
We apply this tool to samples collected during a large study conducted in the DRC and investigate P. ovale spp.
epidemiology across health centers in three provinces.
Regional variation and epidemiological insights in malaria underestimation in Cameroon  Malaria, caused by Plasmodium parasites and transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes, is most common in tropical regions, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Despite significant global effort to control and eradicate the disease, many cases and deaths are still reported yearly.
These efforts are hindered by several factors, including the severe underestimation of cases and deaths, especially in Africa, making it difficult to assess the disease burden accurately.
We used a mathematical model of malaria, incorporating the underestimation of cases and seasonality in mosquito biting rate, to study the disease dynamics in Cameroon.
Using a Bayesian inference framework, we calibrated our model to the monthly reported malaria cases in ten regions of Cameroon from January 2019 to December 2021 to quantify the underestimation of cases and estimate other important epidemiological parameters.
We performed Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components analysis to understand regional disparities, looking at underestimation rates, population sizes, healthcare personnel, and healthcare facilities per 1,000 people.
We found varying levels of underestimation of cases across regions, with the East region having the lowest underestimation (14%) and the Northwest region with the highest (70%).
The mosquito biting rate peaks once every year in most of the regions, except in the Northwest region where it peaks every 6.02 months and in Littoral every 15 months.
We estimated a median mosquito biting rate of over five bites per day for most of the regions with Littoral having the highest (9.86 bites/day).
Two regions have rates below five bites per day: Adamawa (4.78 bites/day) and East (4.64 bites/day).
The notably low estimation of malaria cases in Cameroon underscore the pressing requirement to bolster reporting and surveillance systems.
Regions in Cameroon display a range of unique features, which may contribute to the differing levels of malaria underestimation.
Author summaryO_LIWe used a deterministic mathematical model of malaria that incorporated the underestimation of cases and seasonality in the biting rate of mosquitoes to retroactively study the dynamics of the disease in Cameroon from January 2019 to December 2021.
C_LIO_LIWe found varying levels of underestimation of malaria cases across regions in Cameroon, with the East region having 14% underestimation and the Northwest region having 70%.
C_LIO_LIWe found consistent malaria-induced death rates and natural immunity duration across Cameroon.
We estimated that the mosquito biting rate for the Northwest region oscillated with a period of 6.02 months, while those of the remaining regions had a period of 12 months or more.
Most regions had median mosquito biting rates exceeding five bites per day, with the Littoral having the highest (9.86 bites/day).
In comparison, two regions had rates below five bites per day: Adamawa (4.78 bites/day) and East (4.64 bites/day).

High prevalence of asymptomatic and sub-patent Plasmodium falciparum infections in Urban Bouake, Cote dIvoire, but no hrp2 deletions: Implications for Malaria Control  Asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infections are common in endemic settings, yet diagnosing these infections remains challenging because they are often below the limit of detection of conventional light microscopy (LM) or rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs).
Deletions of the hrp2/3 gene, encoding the protein detected by the most sensitive class of RDTs, present a further threat.
In this study, the prevalence of asymptomatic and sub-patent P. falciparum infections was characterized in the rainy season in the city of Bouake, Central Cote dIvoire.
A cross-sectional survey was conducted in nine neighborhoods of Bouake, Cote dIvoire, in 2016.
Matched LM, RDTs, and varATS qPCR, were used to determine the prevalence of P. falciparum infections and to compare the performance of the different diagnostic methods.
P. falciparum hrp2/3 deletions were typed by digital PCR.
Among 2313 individuals, malaria prevalence was 10.8% by microscopy, 13.0% by RDT, 35.1% by qPCR, and 37.3% (863/2313) when all three methods were combined.
96.4% (832/863) of individuals with P. falciparum infections did not report a recent fever.
57.1% (493/863) of infections were sub-patent.
The prevalence was highly heterogeneous across the neighborhoods, ranging from 15% to 55.2%, and differed among age groups (<5 years: 17.7%, 5-14 years: 42.7%, [&ge;]15 years: 35.9%).
Compared to varATS qPCR, LM and RDT had a low sensitivity of 24.3% and 34.2%, respectively, although both methods were highly specific (>96%).
Sub-microscopic malaria infections were more prevalent in [&ge;]15-year-olds (69.9%, 349/499) and in the neighborhood of Dar es Salam (75.9%, 44/58).
No hrp2 deletions were observed, and two samples carried hrp3 deletion/wild-type mixed infections.
The high prevalence of asymptomatic and sub-patent infections prompts the implementation of strategies targeting these parasite reservoirs to achieve reductions in malaria burden in this high-transmission city of Cote dIvoire.
Experience in the validation of a rapid test for NS1 and IgM for early diagnosis during a dengue epidemic in Colombia  Dengue has a broad spectrum of syndromic presentations, making clinical diagnosis difficult in regions where acute febrile syndrome has multiple etiologies.
Rapid tests for detecting NS1 and IgM are broadly proposed for the early diagnosis of dengue; however, their implementation in primary care settings is inconsistent, and the relevance of IgM detection in this context has not been firmly established.
Our study aimed to describe the experience of validating an NS1-IgM rapid test in primary care settings in Bucaramanga, Colombia, during a dengue epidemic (2018 to 2020).
We tested blood samples from 568 patients with a clinical diagnosis of dengue using the Bioline Dengue Duo rapid test and RT-PCR as a reference to estimate sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (SE, SP, PPV, and NPV, respectively).
The prevalence of infection was 32.9% (95%CI: 29.1, 36.8), whereas SE and SP were 83.4% and 72.7% for NS1 without statistical heterogeneity across disease duration.
NS1s PPV and NPV were 60.0% and 89.9% at the observed prevalence.
Our results show that NS1 and IgM rapid tests (POCT) are feasible in the primary care setting.
The contribution of the NS1 test was indisputable, with high-performance levels far superior to those of the IgM test.
The NS1+IgM combination did not offer a significant advantage over NS1 alone.
Protocol for a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) study of participants in the FEVER Randomized Controlled Trial: Does fever control prevent brain injury in malaria?
BackgroundDespite eradication efforts, [~]135,000 African children sustained brain injuries as a result of central nervous system (CNS) malaria in 2021.
Newer antimalarial medications rapidly clear peripheral parasitemia and improve survival, but mortality remains high with no associated decline in post-malaria neurologic injury.
A randomized controlled trial of aggressive antipyretic therapy with acetaminophen and ibuprofen (Fever RCT) for malarial fevers being conducted in Malawi and Zambia began enrollment in 2019.
MethodsThis observational magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ancillary study will obtain neuroimaging and neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes in children previously enrolled in the Fever RCT at 1- and 12-months post discharge.
Analysis will compare the odds of any brain injury between the aggressive antipyretic therapy and usual care groups based upon MRI structural abnormalities.
For children unable to undergo imaging without deep sedation, neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes will be used to identify brain injury.
DiscussionNeuroimaging is a well-established, valid proxy for neurological outcomes after brain injury in pediatric CNS malaria.
This MRI ancillary study will add value to the Fever RCT by determining if treatment with aggressive antipyretic therapy is neuroprotective in CNS malaria.

BackgroundMalaria remains one of the leading causes of morbidity, and mortality in Uganda.
A large proportion of malaria symptomatic patients seek healthcare in the private sector.
However, availability and affordability are major barriers to access to effective treatment.
The private sector copayment mechanism in Uganda aims to increase availability and affordability of antimalarial agents.
Our study assessed the availability, price, and market share of quality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) in private drug outlets after over a decade of copayment mechanism in the private sector in Uganda.
MethodsThis was a cross-sectional survey of anti-malarial agents in private drug outlets in high (Tororo, and Apac districts) and low (Kabale and Mbarara districts) malaria transmission settings.
Following the World Health Organization Health Action International (WHO/HAI) criteria, an audit of the antimalarial agents was done using a checklist to determine availability, price, and market share of QAACTs.
Data was entered in Epi-data and analyzed in STATA ver 14.0 at 95% confidence level.
ResultsA total of twenty-eight (28) private drug outlets (pharmacies and drug shops) were included in the survey.
One in seven Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) in the drug outlets were quality assured (QAACTs).
Artemether-lumefantrine (AL), 8.9% (11/124) and Artesunate-Amodiaquine (AQ), 7.3% (9/124) were the only QAACTs present in the drug outlets at the time of the survey.
The majority, 86.1%% (124/144) of antimalarial agents present in stock in the drug outlets were artemisinin based.
The most common, 38.9% (56/144) ACT in the drug outlets was Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DHP).
Most, 69.4% (100/144) of the antimalarial agents were in high malaria transmission settings.
The cost of ACT antimalarial agents is high in the country, USD 1.4 (Artemether-Lumefantrine, AL), USD 2.4 (Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine, DP), the first line and second-line agents respectively for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Uganda.
There was a statistically significant difference between the dispensing price of the  Green leaf ACTs and the recommended price (p<0.001).
ConclusionQuality assured artemisinin-based combination therapies (QAACTs) are not common in private drug outlets in low and high malaria transmission settings.
All the drug outlets had at least one ACT antimalarial agent present on the day of the survey.
There is need for awareness creation, surveillance, and monitoring of the implementation of Copayment mechanism in the country.
CR1 variants contribute to FSGS susceptibility across multiple populations.
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome with an annual incidence in the United States in African-Americans compared to European-Americans of 24 cases and 5 cases per million, respectively.
Among glomerular diseases in Europe and Latin-America, FSGS was the second most frequent diagnosis, and in Asia the fifth.
We expand previous efforts in understanding genetics of FSGS by performing a case-control study involving ethnically-diverse groups FSGS cases (726) and a pool of controls (13,994), using panel sequencing of approximately 2,500 podocyte-expressed genes.
A novel significant association was observed for the gene encoding complement receptor 1 (CR1).
High-risk rare variants in CR1 in the European-American cohort were commonly observed in Latin-and African-Americans.
Therefore, a combined rare and common variant analysis was used to replicate the CR1 association in non-European populations.
The CR1 risk variant, rs17047661, gives rise to the Sl1/Sl2 (R1601G) allele that was previously associated with protection against cerebral malaria.
Pleiotropic effects of rs17047661 may explain the difference in allele frequencies across continental ancestries and suggest a possible role for genetically-driven alterations of adaptive immunity in the pathogenesis of FSGS.
Association between HIV/AIDS, Medical Male Circumcision and Traditional Circumcision in Mozambique, 2015  BackgroundThe WHO AFRO region continues to be severely impacted by HIV and a global public health problem.
In Mozambique, as of 2015, HIV prevalence was estimated to be 12.5% among adults.
Medical male circumcision (MMC) has been promoted as a national prevention strategy to reduce the risk of HIV in men.
We aimed to analyze the association between HIV infection, medical male circumcision and traditional male circumcision among men in Mozambique.
MethodsCross-sectional data from the 2015 Mozambican National and Demographic Health Survey of Immunization, Malaria, and HIV/AIDS (IMASIDA) were used in this analysis.
In this study, considered medical male circumcision (MMC) and medical circumcision (MC).
In addition, blood samples were collected from participants and tested for HIV antibodies.
All analyses were weighted and adjusted for the complex survey design to ensure results and approximate population parameters of interest.
Chi-square tests and multiple logistic regression were used in the analyses to assess the associations between male circumcision and HIV infection.
ResultsA total unweighted sample of 4733 men aged 15-49 consented to the survey and were interviewed.
Of those who participated, 4236 consented to an HIV test.
Nationally, 62.6% (95% CI 59.6-65.6) of men aged 15-49 years were circumcised.
Traditional circumcision was the most common form of circumcision at 32.9% (95% CI 30.1-35.8), followed by MMC at 21.7% (95% CI 19.6-24.1), 8.0% (95% CI 6.5-9.9) did not know whether it was traditional or medical.
The prevalence of HIV was highest at 13.4% among uncircumcised men (13.4%, 95% CI 11.3-15.7), and significantly lower among traditionally circumcised men (8.5%, 95% CI 6.8-10.6) and among medically circumcised men (7.5%, 95% CI 5.7-9.6).
In multivariable analysis, men circumcised by a medical practitioner had almost 50% reduced odds of infection with HIV compared to uncircumcised men (aOR=0.52; 95% [CI=0.34-0.78], p=0.002), whereas men who were circumcised by traditional methods had a 29% reduced risk, but not significantly different than uncircumcised men (aOR=0.71; 95% [CI=0.47-1.07], p=0.098).
ConclusionWe found that HIV prevalence was lower among men aged 15-49 years who were circumcised, and the odds of being HIV positive was about 50% lower among men who were circumcised by a medical practitioner, suggesting a reduced risk of HIV infection.
Although Mozambique has not achieved the UNAIDS goal of 80% men circumcised at the time of the IMASIDA 2015 survey, we encourage the continued expansion of voluntary medical male circumcision.
Prevalence of plasmodium infection and associated risk factors among household members in Southern Ethiopia: Mult-site cross-sectional study  Despite continuous prevention and control strategies in place, malaria remains a major public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa including Ethiopia.
This study is, therefore, aimed to determine the prevalence of plasmodium infection and associated risk factors in selected rural kebeles in southern Ethiopia.
A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted between January and June 2019.
Mult-stage sampling techniques were employed to select the study districts and kebeles from four zones.
Blood sample were taken from 1674 participants by finger prick and thin and thick smears were examined by microscopy.
Socio-demographic data as well as risk factors for malaria infection were collected using questionnaires.
Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to analyze the data.
The overall prevalence of malaria in the study localities was 4.5% (76/1674).
The prevalence was varied among the study localities with high prevalence in Bashilo (14.6%; 33/226) followed by Mehal Korga (12.1%; 26/214).
Plasmodium falciparum was the dominant parasite accounted for 65.8% (50/76), while P. vivax accounted 18.4% (14/76).
Co-infection of P. falciparum and P. vivax was 15.8% (12/76).
Co-infection of P. falciparum and P. vivax was 15.8% (12/76).
Co-infection of P. falciparum and P. vivax was 15.8% (12/76).
The prevalence of malaria was 7.8% (27/346) in age less than 5 years and 7.5% (40/531) in 5-14 years.
The age groups >14years were less likely infected with plasmodium parasite (AOR=0.14, 95% CI 0.02-0.82).
Asymptomatic individuals more likely had malaria infection (AOR = 28.4, 95% CI 011.4-70.6).
Individuals living proximity to mosquito breeding sites have higher malaria infection (AOR = 6.17, 95% CI 2.66 - 14.3).
Malaria remains a public health problem in the study localities with lower age group and asymptomatic individuals had higher plasmodium infection.
Thus, malaria prevention and control strategies targeting children and asymptomatic cases are crucial to reduce malaria related morbidity and mortality.
Assessing the impact of housing improvement and ivermectin administration to cattle on malaria transmission in southwest Ethiopia: A study protocol for a community-based cluster randomized control trial  IntroductionThe transmission of malaria and other infectious diseases can be linked to housing conditions.
For malaria, poor housing conditions can result in higher indoor transmission rates compared to improved houses.
The current study aims to introduce a new approach known as the push-pull strategy.
This strategy involves screening houses to prevent mosquitoes from entering the houses and administering ivermectin to cattle to kill mosquitoes in the household compound.
With this approach, we anticipate reducing mosquito bites and, subsequently, malaria incidence.
MethodsThis study is a cluster randomized control trial in malaria-endemic Kebeles (villages -the smallest administrative unit) near the southern Rift Valley Lakes in the Gamo Zone of Ethiopia.
The trial is open-labeled and four-armed with 60 clusters.
The unit of randomization is a cluster ("Limat Budin" with 30-35 households) with an equal number of households in each arm.
Each cluster will receive one of the following interventions: house screening (n=15), ivermectin cattle treatment (n=15), a combination of house screening and ivermectin cattle treatment (n=15), or no intervention (control arm, only a standard malaria prevention intervention; n=15).
All clusters will continue with the essential malaria interventions such as bed nets and, according to the Ministry of Health policy.
A total of 1912 households with 9060 individuals will be included in the study.
The studys primary outcome is determining malaria incidence among all age groups in the intervention groups compared to the control arm.
Over two years, we will screen study participants every four months to measure epidemiologic and serologic endpoints.
Additionally, we will conduct bimonthly entomological assessments in 480 households with equal numbers in each arm for two years.
All household members will undergo malaria testing using microscopy, with results confirmed through molecular methods to determine malaria prevalence and incidence.
Children under five will also be tested for anemia with the Hemocue 301+ analyzer.
We will use serological markers and entomological indices to estimate the human exposure to parasites and mosquito bites.
DiscussionThis is the first randomized control trial to assess the effectiveness of the push-pull strategy in controlling malaria in Ethiopia.
This innovative approach aims to decrease the number of malaria-carrying mosquitoes indoors and outdoors, reduce human exposure to mosquito bites and parasites, and ultimately lower malaria incidence.
Moreover, this strategy has the potential to ease the burden of malaria illness and aid in reducing household poverty.
EthicsThe trial has been approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Review Board (IRB/1423/2023) and the Animal Ethics Review Committee (AMU/AREC/12/2015) of Arba Minch University.
Additionally, policymakers will be informed of the results and possibly incorporate them into the national malaria control toolbox.
Automatic mapping of high-risk urban areas for Aedes aegypti infestation based on building facade image analysis  BackgroundDengue, Zika, and chikungunya, whose viruses are transmitted mainly by Aedes aegypti, significantly impact human health worldwide.
Despite the recent development of promising vaccines against the dengue virus, controlling these arbovirus diseases still depends on mosquito surveillance and control.
Identifying higher-risk areas in a municipality and directing control efforts towards them could improve it.
One tool for this is the premise condition index (PCI); however, its measure requires visiting all buildings.
We propose a novel approach capable of predicting the PCI based on facade street-level images, which we call PCINet.
MethodologyOur study was conducted in Campinas, a one million-inhabitant city in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
We surveyed 200 blocks, visited their buildings, and measured the three traditional PCI components (building and backyard conditions and shading), the facade conditions (taking pictures of them), and other characteristics.
We trained a deep neural network with the pictures taken, creating a computational model that can predict buildings conditions based on the view of their facades.
We evaluated PCINet in a scenario emulating a real large-scale situation, where the model could be deployed to automatically monitor four regions of Campinas to identify risk areas.
Principal findingsPCINet produced reasonable results in differentiating the facade condition into three levels, and it is a scalable strategy to triage large areas.
The entire process can be automated through data collection from facade data sources and inferences through PCINet.
The facade conditions correlated highly with the building and backyard conditions and reasonably well with shading and backyard conditions.
The use of street-level images and PCINet could help to optimize Ae.
aegypti surveillance and control, reducing the number of in-person visits necessary to identify buildings, blocks, and neighborhoods at higher risk from mosquito and arbovirus diseases.
aegypti require intensive work and considerable financial resources, are time-consuming, and are commonly affected by operational problems requiring urgent improvement.
The PCI is a good tool for identifying higher-risk areas; however, its measure requires a high amount of human and material resources, and the aforementioned issues remain.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach capable of predicting the PCI of buildings based on street-level images.
This first work combines deep learning-based methods with street-level data to predict facade conditions.
Considering the good results obtained with PCINet and the good correlations of facade conditions with PCI components, we could use this methodology to classify building conditions without visiting them physically.
Although we have a long road ahead, our results show that PCINet could help to optimize Ae.
aegypti and arbovirus surveillance and control, reducing the number of in-person visits necessary to identify buildings or areas at risk.
The role of Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles funestus in malaria transmission within houses with different characteristics in South-eastern Tanzania  BackgroundMalaria vectors persist predominantly in houses lacking screened windows, doors, and eave space, leading to ongoing transmission.
Some other vectors adapt their feeding behavior to sustain reproduction.
This study evaluates the role of primary malaria vectors on malaria transmission in relation to house characteristics in Kilombero Valley.
MethodsMosquito data collection was done using three methods: a CDC light trap, a miniaturized double net trap (DN-Mini trap), and a Prokopack aspirator through 222 households that were randomly selected in the three villages, namely Ebuyu, Chirombora, and Mzelezi.
The houses are characterized during mosquito collections, and the Geographical Position System (GPS) was used to geolocate the sampled houses.
Morphological identification was done on the collected sample (i.e., fed, part-fed, gravid, and unfed), and a sub-sample was sent to the laboratory to assess the sibling species, blood meal, and sporozoite.
ResultsA total of 1542 Anopheline mosquitoes were collected, of which 79.1% (n= 1219) were An.
funestus and 20.3% (n= 313) were An.
arabiensis as primary malaria vectors, while the secondary malaria vector was 0.6% (n = 10).
Out of 487 anopheline mosquitoes assayed for plasmodium falciparum sporozoite, 92.8% (n = 13) of An.
funestus was reported to be dominant while An.
arabiensis was dominant by 7.2% (n = 1).
funestus was the only species that had a blood meal and was found to feed on humans (88.16%, n = 134), dogs (11.18% n = 17), and a mixture of both human and chicken blood meal.
In addition to that, the house with screened eave space had fewer An.
funestus compared to the house with open eave space (RR = 0.978, p =0.864), while the house with a brick wall had a higher An.
funestus compared with the house with a mud wall (RR = 0.690, p =0.107).
ConclusionAnopheles funestus remained the dominant malaria vector responsible for all transmissions in the villages.
funestus, which contributes about 92.8% of infections in the village.
Additionally, the house design appears to play a significant role in facilitating malaria vectors to continue transmitting malaria.
Characterizing mobility patterns and malaria risk factors in semi-nomadic populations of Northern Kenya  While many studies have characterized mobility patterns and disease dynamics of individuals from settled populations, few have focused on more mobile populations.
Highly mobile groups are often at higher disease risk due to their regular movement that may increase the variability of their environments, reduce their access to health care, and limit the number of intervention strategies suitable for their lifestyles.
Here, we worked with four semi-nomadic communities in Central Turkana, Kenya to 1) characterize mobility patterns of travelers from semi-nomadic communities and 2) test the hypothesis that semi-nomadic individuals are at greater risk of exposure to malaria during seasonal migrations than when staying at their semi-permanent settlements.
From March-October, 2021, we conducted a study in semi-nomadic households (n=250) where some members traveled with their herd while others remained at the semi-permanent settlement.
Participants provided medical and travel histories, demographics, and a dried blood spot for malaria testing before and after the travel period.
Further, a subset of travelers was given GPS loggers to document their routes.
Four travel patterns emerged from the logger data, Long Term, Transient, Day trip, and Static, with only Long Term and Transient trips being associated with malaria cases detected in individuals who carried GPS devices.
After completing their trips, travelers had a higher prevalence of malaria than those who remained at the household (9.2% vs 4.4%), regardless of gender, age group, and catchment area.
These findings highlight the need to develop intervention strategies amenable to mobile lifestyles that can ultimately help prevent the transmission of malaria.
Does community-based health insurance affect lifestyle and timing of treatment seeking behavior?
Evidence from Ethiopia  There has been a growing concern about the financial sustainability of community-based health insurance (CBHI) schemes in developing countries recently.
We respond to this concern by investigating the effects of being insured on household lifestyle -Preventive Care- and the timing of treatment seeking behavior in the context of Ethiopias CBHI scheme.
Using three rounds of household panel data and a fixed-effects household model, we do not find a significant impact on preventive care activities.
However, we find that participation in CBHI increases delay in treatment-seeking behavior for malaria, tetanus, and tuberculosis symptoms.
Therefore, it is essential to identify the primary causes of delays in seeking medical services and implement appropriate interventions aimed at encouraging insured individuals to seek early medical attention when signs of diseases emerge.
HIGH AND UNSUSTAINABLE COST OF CONTROLLING THE DENGUE VECTOR AEDES AEGYPTI IN THE PERUVIAN AMAZON  ObjectivesVector control is the method of prevention and control of dengue outbreaks used in Peru.
With the objective of calculating the costs incurred in vector control, an estimation of the costs of Aedes aegypti control of the Regional Health Directorate of Loreto, during the execution of the regional plan for surveillance and control of A. aegypti was carried out.
Materials and methodsDocumentation was reviewed, and interviews were conducted with stakeholders about the costs of A. aegypti control interventions in its adult and larval stages, during 2017 and 2018.
ResultsIt was found that the costs incurred in the control of the dengue vector in the Loreto Region in the two years studied amount to: 3,807,858 and 4,066,380 soles during 2017 and 2018 respectively, 1175,264 and 11210,232 dollars at the exchange rate of 2017 and 2018, however, the effect of the control activities is short-lived.
ConclusionsThe high cost involved in vector control with the methods currently used and the short duration of its effect makes it unsustainable so studies should be conducted to find other more efficient methods of dengue control.
Recent cross-sectional prevalence studies in sub-Saharan Africa for communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases and conditions: a scoping review  BackgroundCross-sectional prevalence studies provide benefits to policymakers, epidemiologists, trialists, and the future health of target and general populations.
Too few of these studies are performed in hotspots of traditional global health disease burden.
This results in a lack of recent, local, accurate prevalence estimates to inform policy, epidemiology, and the design of interventional randomized controlled trials that may be conducted in these regions.
ObjectiveThis scoping review aims to establish a novel dataset usable as an observational baseline.
The topic being analyzed is the set of characteristics describing recently published prospective cross-sectional prevalence studies in sub-Saharan Africa for humans affected with communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases and conditions.
MethodsThis scoping review conducted a systematic literature search of PubMed.
The search identified publications in the last four years describing completed cross-sectional prevalence studies in sub-Saharan Africa.
Data extraction was performed on a random sample of the final dataset.
ResultsThis scoping review identified 868 titles and abstracts through our systematic search.
Through our screening process, 394 of these were candidates eligible for inclusion in our dataset.
Ultimately, 363 were in the final dataset.
Of the 38 studies in the random sample, this scoping review found a large portion of the studies completed with no funding.
Malaria was the predominant disease studied, followed by parasitic intestinal infection and malnutrition.
ConclusionsCross-sectional prevalence studies are happening in sub-Saharan Africa for many communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases and conditions.
Many studies are self-funded by the principal investigator.
Plasmodium vivax genomic surveillance in the Peruvian Amazon with Pv AmpliSeq assay  BackgroundPlasmodium vivax is the most predominant malaria species in Latin America, constituting 71.5% of malaria cases in 2021.
With several countries aiming for malaria elimination, it is crucial to prioritize effectiveness of national control programs by optimizing the utilization of available resources and strategically implementing necessary changes.
To support this, there is a need for innovative approaches such as genomic surveillance tools that can investigate changes in transmission intensity, imported cases and sources of reintroduction, and can detect molecular markers associated with drug resistance.
Methodology/Principal FindingsHere, we apply a modified highly-multiplexed deep sequencing assay: Pv AmpliSeq v2 Peru.
The tool targets a newly developed 41-SNP Peru barcode for parasite population analysis within Peru, the 33-SNP vivaxGEN-geo panel for country-level classification, and 11 putative drug resistance genes.
It was applied to 230 samples from the Peruvian Amazon (2007 - 2020), generating baseline surveillance data.
We observed a heterogenous P. vivax population with high diversity and gene flow in peri-urban areas of Maynas province (Loreto region) with a temporal drift.
In comparison, in an indigenous isolated area, the parasite population was genetically differentiated (FST=0.07-0.09) with moderate diversity and high relatedness between isolates in the community.
In a remote border community, a clonal P. vivax cluster was identified, with distinct haplotypes in drug resistant genes and ama1, more similar to Brazilian isolates, likely representing an introduction of P. vivax from Brazil at that time.
In a remote border community, a clonal P. vivax cluster was identified, with distinct haplotypes in drug resistant genes and ama1, more similar to Brazilian isolates, likely representing an introduction of P. vivax from Brazil at that time.
In a remote border community, a clonal P. vivax cluster was identified, with distinct haplotypes in drug resistant genes and ama1, more similar to Brazilian isolates, likely representing an introduction of P. vivax from Brazil at that time.
To test its applicability for Latin America, we evaluated the SNP Peru barcode in P. vivax genomes from the region and demonstrated the capacity to capture local population clustering at within-country level.
Conclusions/SignificanceTogether this data shows that P. vivax transmission is heterogeneous in different settings within the Peruvian Amazon.
Genetic analysis is a key component for regional malaria control, offering valuable insights that should be incorporated into routine surveillance.
Author SummaryLatin America is aiming towards malaria elimination.
Genomic surveillance is crucial for a countrys malaria strategy, aiding in understanding and stopping the spread of the disease.
While widely used for another malaria species (Plasmodium falciparum), limited tools exist for tracking P. vivax, a significant player in malaria-endemic areas outside of Africa, and the primary cause of malaria in Latin America.
In this study, we used a new tool, Pv AmpliSeq v2 Peru assay, to examine the genetic makeup of malaria parasites in the Peruvian Amazon.
This tool helps us see how the parasites from different areas are connected and tracks markers that could indicate resistance to drugs.
We found that the parasites from remote areas in the Amazon were genetically different from parasites in areas surrounding the main city of Iquitos, and parasites in a remote border community were genetically more similar to Brazilian parasites.
We also show that the Pv AmpliSeq v2 Peru assay can be used to study parasites from other countries in Latin America, highlighting the broader application in the region.
Considering that parasites are not constrained by borders and can easily spread between neighboring countries, a regional approach can be crucial for malaria elimination.
Social determinants of recovery from ongoing symptoms following COVID-19 in two UK longitudinal studies: a prospective cohort study  BackgroundSocial gradients in COVID-19 exposure, illness severity, and mortality have been observed in multiple international contexts.
Whether pre-existing social factors affect recovery from ongoing symptoms following COVID-19 and long COVID is less well understood.
MethodsWe analysed data on self-perceived recovery following self-reported COVID-19 illness in two United Kingdom community-based cohorts, COVID Symptom Study Biobank (CSSB) (N = 2548) and TwinsUK (N = 1334).
Composite variables quantifying socio-demographic advantage and disadvantage prior to the COVID-19 pandemic were generated from sex, ethnic group, education, local area deprivation and employment status.
Associations between self-perceived recovery and composite variables were tested with multivariable logistic regression models weighted for inverse probability of study participation, adjusting for potential confounding by age, region and pre- pandemic health factors, and potential mediation by COVID-19 illness characteristics and adverse experiences during the pandemic.
Further analyses tested associations between recovery and individual socio-demographic variables reflecting status prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic.
FindingsSocio-demographic gradients in recovery were observed, with unadjusted recovery rate varying between 50% and 80% in CSSB and 70% and 90% in TwinsUK based on composite socio-demographic variables.
Likelihood of recovery was lower for individuals with more indicators of pre-pandemic social disadvantage in both cohorts (CSSB: odds ratio, OR = 0.74, 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.62-0.88, TwinsUK: OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.64-0.98 per disadvantage) and higher with more social advantages (CSSB: OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.08-1.47, TwinsUK: OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.09-1.70 per advantage).
Associations were neither explained by differences in COVID-19 illness severity or timing, nor adverse social experiences during the pandemic, which were themselves inversely associated with recovery.
InterpretationStrong social inequalities in the likelihood of recovery from COVID-19 were observed, with ongoing symptoms several months after coronavirus infection more likely for individuals with multiple indicators of social disadvantage.

Plain language summaryAcross the world acute COVID-19 illness has affected the most disadvantaged in society the most.
In our study, we asked people from two UK-based health studies if they still had symptoms after having COVID-19.
In both studies, people who were more disadvantaged were more likely to still have symptoms long after having COVID-19.
We also saw that people who had negative experiences during the pandemic such as losing their job, being unable to afford their bills or not being able to access health & social care services were less likely to recover.
More work is needed to understand how and why recovery was so different for people with different circumstances.
Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSTo search for previous reports on associations between recovery from COVID-19 and socio-demographic factors, we screened abstracts identified from the PubMed search query on December 21, 2023: "((COVID-19) AND ((recovery) OR (convalescence) OR (" ongoing symptoms")) AND ((socioeconomic) OR (sociodemographic) OR (social) OR (gradient))) AND LitCLONGCOVID[filter]", where LitCLONGCOVID is a filter for articles relating to long COVID (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/help/#covid19-article-filters), which returned 210 results published between July, 2020 and December, 2023.
A small number (N = 11) of studies contained direct measures of recovery from COVID-19 in terms of presence/absence of ongoing symptoms relating to COVID-19 illness, either as perceived by the individual or inferred from current symptom reports.
Of these, most focused on associations with COVID-19 illness factors such as severity and symptomatology, and prior health indicators.
Of the few studies (N = 8) that tested associations with socio-demographic variables, the range of socio-demographics tested was limited and/or follow-up time typically restricted to 6-12 months since symptom onset.
In these studies, associations with recovery were reported for age (N = 4), sex (N = 7), race/ethnicity (N = 2), local area deprivation (N = 1), and education level (N = 1).
Associations between long-term symptoms and education or income have been reported in single separate studies.
Monthly bulletins up to March 2023 from the UK Coronavirus Infection Survey highlighted prevalence of individuals reporting current effects on daily activities due to long COVID was associated with age, sex, race/ethnicity, local area deprivation and economic activity.
No studies were identified that tested for associations of multiple socio-demographics in combination with the likelihood of recovery following COVID-19.
Added value of this studyThis is the first study to testing the effects of multiple socio-demographics on self-perceived recovery in combination.
Our study has a longer follow-up time than previous comparable reports, with most participants assessed more than one year after infection onset.
Detailed data on health before the coronavirus pandemic and COVID-19 illness allowed models to be adjusted extensively and mediation effects to be tested.
Implications of all the available evidenceThe likelihood of full recovery following COVID-19 appears to follow a social gradient, higher for individuals with multiple indicators of social advantages and fewer disadvantages, and lower for those with multiple social disadvantages and fewer advantages prior to the coronavirus pandemic.
More work is needed to understand the pathways through which this inequality operates so that interventions can be made.
Identification of Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma mansoni linear B-cell epitopes with diagnostic potential using in silico immunoinformatic tools and peptide microarray technology.
IntroductionImmunoinformatic tools can be used to predict schistosome-specific B-cell epitopes with little sequence identity to human proteins and antigens other than the target.
This study reports an approach for identifying schistosome peptides mimicking linear B-cell epitopes using in-silico tools and peptide microarray immunoassays validation.
MethodFirstly, a comprehensive literature search was conducted to obtain published schistosome-specific peptides and recombinant proteins with the best overall diagnostic performances.
For novel peptides, linear B-cell epitopes were predicted from target recombinant proteins using ABCpred, Bcepred and BepiPred 2.0 in-silico tools.
Together with the published peptides, predicted peptides with the highest probability of being B-cell epitopes and the lowest sequence identity with proteins from human and other pathogens were selected.
Antibodies against the peptides were measured in sera, using peptide microarray immunoassays.
Area under the ROC curve was calculated to assess the overall diagnostic performances of the peptides.

1 Author summarySchistosomiasis commonly known as bilharzia is the third most significant tropical disease after malaria and soil-transmitted helminthiases.
Like other neglected tropical diseases common in Zimbabwe, schistosomiasis remains mostly undiagnosed or undetected.
This is partly due to the fact that reliable identification of parasites requires expertise for specimen preparation, and microscopic examination which are largely unavailable in most rural clinics.
This limitation is further compounded by the fact that the recommended microscopy-based methods for schistosomiasis diagnosis lack sensitivity, especially in infections of low intensity.
To overcome some of the caveats associated with microscopy-based methods, highly sensitive serological tests have been utilized.
Unfortunately, currently available serological tests have low specificity and show cross-reactivity with other helminthic infections.
One way to mitigate the cross-reactivity challenge and increase the specificity, is to use immunoinformatic tools and immunoassays to identify schistosomiasis species-specific immunogenic peptides mimicking B-cell epitopes (short amino acid sequences of the antigen that reacts with antibodies).
Utilizing immunoinformatic tools coupled with peptide microarray immunoassay validation approach several peptides that can be used to develop diagnostic tools for showing exposure to infection for people living in non-endemic or low-transmission areas were identified in the current study.
Dengue Vaccine Effectiveness: Results from a Six-Year Population-Based Cohort Study in Southern Brazil  The alarming growth of dengue worldwide and its social and economic impact have demanded more effective responses for its prevention and control.
Currently, the first vaccine approved in Brazil for its prevention, Dengvaxia(R), was administered to a target population of around 500,000 residents in southern Brazil.
This study reports its effectiveness after a six-year follow-up period from August 2016 to July 2022.
Dengue vaccination campaign was carried out in a target population of individuals aged 15-27 in 28 municipalities and 9-44 years in the other two.
In this population-based cohort study, exposure to the vaccine included groups with different numbers of doses and adherence to the complete schedule.
The primary outcome was probable dengue case.
Other endpoints included laboratory- confirmed dengue, serotype, dengue with warning signs or severe illness, and hospitalization.
Approximately 60.4% of the participants received at least one vaccine dose.
A total of 50,658 probable dengue cases (PDC) were notified of which 15,131 were laboratory-confirmed dengue cases.
Overall effectiveness for at least one dose was 33.7% (95% CI: 32.5-34.9) for PDC and 20.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 17.1-22.9) for laboratory-confirmed cases.
Greater vaccine effectiveness was observed in older individuals and for the DENV-4 and DENV-1 serotypes.
The vaccine showed no effectiveness against DENV-2; no DENV-3 cases occurred.
A lower hospitalization rate was observed among the vaccinated group.
Differences in the incidence of severe dengue cases and warning signs could not draw a definite conclusion.
Vaccination was associated with a one-third reduction in the incidence of probable dengue cases.
Author SummariesOutcomes resulting from dengue mass vaccination remains limited.

Dengue risk reduction was significant for DENV-1 and DENV-4.
Modelling the within-host dynamics of Plasmodium vivax hypnozoite activation: an analysis of the SPf66 vaccine trial  Plasmodium vivax parasites can lie dormant in the liver as hypnozoites, activating weeks to months after sporozoite inoculation to cause relapsing malarial illness.
We use longitudinal data from the most detailed cohort study ever conducted in an area where both Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax were endemic to fit a simple within-host mathematical model of P. vivax hypnozoite activation.

1344 children living on the Thailand-Myanmar border were followed each day for 21 months.
There were 2504 vivax and 1164 falciparum malaria symptomatic episodes recorded over 1988 person-years.
The model assumes that hypnozoites activate independently at a constant rate ( exponential clock model).
When this model was embedded in a stochastic framework for repeated infectious mosquito bites, with seasonality inferred from the incidence of clinical falciparum malaria episodes, it explained the observed temporal patterns of multiple (up to 13) recurrent vivax malaria episodes.
Under this model we estimate the mean dormancy period for a single hypnozoite to be 6 months (i.e.
We use the calibrated within-host model to characterise population level overdispersion in the risk of relapse, and assess the potential utility of a serological test for radical cure in low transmission settings.
We show that mefloquine treatment of falciparum malaria eliminates early vivax relapses; and that there are substantially more P. vivax recurrences than expected under the model following artesunate monotherapy treatment for falciparum malaria.
These results suggest that hypnozoites can be activated by symptomatic malarial illness.
A Healthcare Service Delivery and Epidemiological Model for Investigating Resource Allocation for Health: The Thanzi La Onse Model  BackgroundDecisions need to be made in all healthcare systems about the allocation of available resources with the aim of improving population health.
Evidence is needed for these decisions, which can have enormous consequences for population health, especially in lower-income settings.
MethodsWe address this need using an individual-based simulation model of healthcare need and service delivery that we have developed for Malawi, drawing on demographic, epidemiological and routine healthcare system data (on facilities, staff, and consumables).
We analyse the effects of improvements in healthcare access, clinician performance and consumables availability.
FindingsMalawis healthcare system averted 40 million Disability-Adjusted Life-Years (DALYs) in the five-year period to end-2019, which is half of the total DALYS that the population (total size: 19 million in 2020) would otherwise incur.
This impact is strongly focussed on young children (mediated largely by programmes addressing respiratory infections, HIV/AIDS and malaria) and also by the HIV/AIDS and TB programmes (among adults).
Nevertheless, the additional services that are provided (through service times being reduced or additional HCW hours worked) account for half the impact of the healthcare system (i.e., [~]20 million DALYS averted).
If system improvements gave ill persons immediate access to healthcare, led to optimal referral and diagnosis accuracy, and eliminated consumable stock-outs, the overall impact of the healthcare system could increase by up to [~]30% (12 million more DALYS averted).
Strengthening interventions could potentially increase these gains considerably and so should be a priority for investigation and investment.
A detailed individual-based simulation model of healthcare service delivery is a valuable tool for healthcare system planning and for evaluating proposals for healthcare system strengthening.
Malaria and other risk factors for malnutrition, and the impact of intermittent preventive therapy for malaria on nutritional status of school-age children in Tanzania.
BackgroundWHO and the Lancet reported that malaria and malnutrition form a double health burden in low and middle-income countries.
Despite the massive implementation of several malaria interventions, there is limited information on the impact of intermittent preventive therapy (IPTsc) for malaria on the nutritional status of school-age children.
ObjectiveTo determine malnutrition risk factors and evaluate the impact of IPTsc for malaria on the nutritional status of school-age children in North-East Tanzania.
Study participants were randomized to three treatment groups and thereafter followed for 20 months.
Data were analyzed using logistic regression and a linear mixed model.
FindingsAt baseline, the prevalence of malaria was 27%.
23% of [&le;]10 years children were underweight, 21% were stunted, and 28% were either thin or severely thin.
The odds of stunting were 78% higher (AOR=1.78, 95%CI=[1.36, 2.33], P<0.001) among children who had malaria compared to those who did not.
Children from low socioeconomic status (SES) had higher odds of being underweight (AOR=1.50, 95%CI=[1.13,2.01], P=0.006) compared to their high SES counterparts.
During the intervention, change in mean weight, height, and BMI over time as estimated from age-treatment interaction was not significantly different in the DP and ASAQ treatment groups compared to the control group.
A unit change in age increased weight, height, and BMI by 2.2 units (p-value <0.001), 3.3 units (p-value <0.001), and 0.5 units (p-value <0.001).
The height and weight in female children were higher compared to that of male children by 1 unit (p-value <0.001) and 0.8 unit (p-value <0.001), respectively.
ConclusionThe burden of malaria and malnutrition in this studys setting is remarkable.
Instead of focusing only on malaria, public health agencies should reinforce nutritional programs by collaborating with local communities to ensure food availability in schools and provide sustainable nutritional education to the local community members.
Genetic polymorphism and evidence of signatures of selection in the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein gene in Tanzanian regions with different malaria endemicity  BackgroundIn 2021 and 2023, the World Health Organization approved RTS,S/AS01 and R21/Matrix M malaria vaccines, respectively, for routine immunization of children in African countries with moderate to high transmission.
These vaccines are made of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (Pfcsp) but polymorphisms in this gene raises concerns regarding strain-specific responses and the long-term efficacy of these vaccines.
This study assessed the Pfcsp genetic diversity, population structure and signatures of selection among parasites from areas of different malaria transmission in mainland Tanzania, to generate baseline data before the introduction of the malaria vaccines in the country.
MethodsThe analysis involved 589 whole genome sequences generated by and as part of the MalariaGEN Community Project.
The samples were collected between 2013 and January 2015 from five regions of mainland Tanzania: Morogoro and Tanga (Muheza) (moderate transmission areas), and Kagera (Muleba), Lindi (Nachingwea), and Kigoma (Ujiji) (high transmission areas).
Wrights inbreeding coefficient (Fws), Wrights fixation index (FST), principal component analysis, nucleotide diversity, and Tajimas D were used to assess within-host parasite diversity, population structure and natural selection.
ResultsBased on Fws (< 0.95), there was high polyclonality (ranged from 69.23% in Nachingwea to 56.9% in Muheza).
No population structure was detected in the Pfcsp gene in the five regions (mean FST= 0.0068).
The average nucleotide diversity ({pi}), nucleotide differentiation (K) and haplotype diversity (Hd) in the five regions were 4.19, 0.973 and 0.0035, respectively.
The C-terminal region of Pfcsp showed high nucleotide diversity at Th2R and Th3R regions.
Positive values for the Tajimas D were observed in the Th2R and Th3R regions consistent with balancing selection.
The Pfcsp C-terminal sequences had 50 different haplotypes (H_1 to H_50) and only 2% of sequences matched the 3D7 strain haplotype (H_50).
ConclusionsThe findings demonstrate high diversity of the Pfcsp gene with limited population differentiation.
The Pfcsp gene showed positive Tajimas D values for parasite populations, consistent with balancing selection for variants within Th2R and Th3R regions.
This data is consistent with other studies conducted across Africa and worldwide, which demonstrate low 3D7 haplotypes and little population structure.
Such insights will inform the choice of alleles to be included in the future vaccines
Knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP), and acceptance and willingness to pay (WTP) for mosquito-borne diseases control through sterile mosquito release in Bangkok, Thailand  BackgroundArboviral diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika are public health concerns worldwide.
Sterile insect technique (SIT) and incompatible insect technique (IIT) are environmental friendly approaches that show promising impacts.
In order to plan an implementation of SIT/IIT technology, the background knowledge, attitude and practice related to these diseases and their mosquito vectors in the targeted communities are needed.
Methodology/Principal findingsIn this paper, we conducted the questionnaire surveys on general knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) related to mosquito-borne diseases, mosquito vectors, as well as prevention and control in 400 sampling households in seven communities located in two districts in Bangkok, Thailand.
The acceptance and willingness to pay (WTP) for sterile mosquitoes to be used as an alternative vector control approach was also investigated.
Our findings indicated that the surveyed participants had high knowledge on dengue (85.25%) and they were more concerned with the severity of dengue (81%) than chikungunya (42.5%) and Zika (37%).
Participants with the ages lower than 35 years old (p = 0.047) and the incomes higher than 5,000 THB (p = 0.016) had more knowledge on mosquito vectors.
Moreover, 47% of respondents had positive attitude toward sterile mosquitoes and their application in vector control even though 45.5% of them had never heard about the technology.
Conclusions/significanceThe baseline information obtained from this questionnaire survey could be used for planning the sterile mosquito release by public health authorities in Bangkok, Thailand where dengue, chikungunya and Zika were still prevalent.
Author summaryA questionnaire survey was conducted in seven communities in Bangkok, Thailand to obtain the baseline information on knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) related to mosquito-borne diseases, i.e., dengue, chikungunya and Zika, including mosquito vectors and how to control them.
The questionnaire also asked about the acceptance and willingness to pay (WTP) for sterile mosquitoes used in controlling mosquito populations.
Our results showed that, from the total of 400 sampling households, about 85% of participants were familiar with dengue, the mosquito vectors as well as their prevention and control.
Furthermore, participants with lower ages and higher incomes had more knowledge on mosquito vectors (p < 0.05).
Even though the majority of participants showed positive perception about sterile mosquitoes release in terms of the environment, economic, social and quality of life, but more than half of them were not willing to pay for sterile mosquitoes as they would like to receive them free of charge from the government.
In the case that they have to pay, the cost that they could afford was 1-2 THB per sterile mosquito.
These findings should be useful for public health authorities in planning to apply the sterile mosquito release as an alternative mosquito control approach in Bangkok, Thailand.
A reporter virus particle seroneutralization assay for tick-borne encephalitis virus overcomes ELISA limitations  BackgroundTick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus is the most common tick-transmitted Orthoflavivirus in Europe.
Due to its non-specific symptoms, TBE is primarily diagnosed by ELISA-based detection of specific antibodies in the patient serum.
However, cross-reactivity between orthoflaviviruses complicates the diagnosis.
Specificity problems may be overcome by serum neutralization assays (SNT), however clinically relevant orthoflaviviruses require handling in biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) and they have highly divergent viral kinetics and cell tropisms.
MethodsWe present a reporter viral particle (RVP) based SNT in which the infectivity is measured by luminescence and that can be performed under BSL-2 conditions.
FindingsThe RVP-based SNT for TBEV exhibited a remarkable correlation with the traditional virus-based SNT (R2=0.8614, p<0.0001).
Notably, the RVP-based assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 91.7% (95% CI: 87.2-97.1%) and specificity of 100% (95% CI: 79.6-100%).
We also tested the cross-reactivity of serum samples in RVP-based assays against other orthoflaviviruses (yellow fever virus, dengue virus type 2, Zika virus, West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis virus).
Interestingly, in 90% of cases where a serum sample had tested TBEV-positive by ELISA but negative by RVP-based SNT, we identified antibodies against other orthoflaviviruses.
InterpretationsThe RVP-based seroneutralization assay show clinical relevance and broad- applicability.
FundingThis study was supported by Bavarian Nordic grant to R.A. and V.C.
RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSELISA tests for orthoflavivirus serology are the method of choice in all diagnostic laboratories despite the cross-reactivity issues.
Although seroneutralization testing (SNT) provides more reliable results, it requires BSL-3 conditions and approximately a week to obtain the results.
However, developing tests with a broader applicability could overcome the problem of cross-reactivity of antibodies against flaviviruses could be overcome leading to a more accurate diagnosis and fewer non-useful results.
Although alternative serological tests for other orthoflaviviruses have been investigated they have limitations, including lack of uniformity for different orthoflaviviruses, the need for a BSL-3 laboratory to perform them, and results taking 4-5 days.
The reporter viral particle system (RVP) we used in this study has been reported for all orthoflaviviruses, except for YFV.
Added value of this studyWe tested the RVP system uniformly for different orthoflaviviruses and evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of SNT based on RVP compared to virus-based and to ELISA.
Additionally, we found that false positives in ELISA in our clinical samples are frequently related to YFV positive samples.
Implications of all the available evidenceThis study demonstrates the reliability and broad applicability of implementing RVP-based SNT in a clinical setting.
Additionally, our data suggest that it is important to consider YFV exposure or vaccination anamnesis in patients medical history.
This is consistent with the phylogenetic similarity between YFV and TBEV if compared to other flaviviruses.
Community benefits of mass distribution of three types of dual-active-ingredient  long-lasting insecticidal nets against malaria prevalence in Tanzania  BackgroundLong-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) were once fully effective for the prevention of malaria; however, mosquitoes have developed resistance to pyrethroids, the main class of insecticides used on nets.
Dual active ingredient LLINs (dual-AI LLINs) have been rolled out as an alternative to pyrethroid (PY)-only LLINs to counteract this.
Understanding the minimum community usage at which these novel nets generate an effect that also benefits non-net users against malaria infection is vital for planning net distribution strategies and mobilization campaigns.
MethodsWe conducted a secondary analysis of a 3-year randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 84 clusters in North-western Tanzania to evaluate the effectiveness of three dual-AI LLINs: pyriproxyfen and alpha()-cypermethrin (pyriproxyfen-PY), chlorfenapyr and -cypermethrin (chlorfenapyr-PY), and the synergist piperonyl-butoxide and permethrin (PBO-PY) compared to -cypermethrin only nets (PY-only).
We measured malaria infection prevalence using 5 cross-sectional surveys between 2020 and 2022.
We assessed net usage at the cluster level and malaria infection in up to two children aged between 6 months and 14 years in 45 households per cluster and compared infection prevalence between net users and non-users with the different net types and usage levels.
FindingsA total of 22,479 children from 12,654 households were tested for malaria using rapid diagnostic tests in January 2020, 2021, & 2022 and July 2020 & 2021.
In all surveys combined, 23% (5,062/22,479) of children reported not using a net the night before the surveys.
The proportion of non-net users was highest in the later surveys.
Across all study arms and at each time point, users of nets had significantly lower malaria infection than non-users.
Overall, malaria prevalence was 52% (2649/5062) among non-net users and 32% (5572/11845) among users (of any net).
Among non-net users, community-level usage of >40% of dual-AI LLIN was significantly associated with protection against malaria infection: chlorfenapyr-PY (OR: 0.44 (95% CI: 0.27-0.71), p=0.0009), PBO-PY (OR: 0.55 (95% CI: 0.33-0.94), p=0.0277) and pyriproxyfen-PY (OR: 0.61 (95% CI: 0.37-0.99), p=0.0470) compared with non-users in clusters with >40% usage of PY-only LLINs.
There was weak evidence of protection against malaria infection to non-net users in the chlorfenapyr-PY arm when community-level usage was [&le;]40% (OR: 0.65 (95% CI: 0.42-1.01), p=0.0528) compared to those living in clusters with >40% usage of pyrethroid-only LLINs.
The study was limited to non-users which were defined as participants who did not sleep under any net the night before.
ConclusionOur study demonstrated that at a community usage of 40% or more of dual-AI LLINs, non-net users benefited from the presence of these nets.
Noticeably, even when usage was [&le;]40% in the chlorfenapyr-PY arm, non-users were better protected than non-users in the higher coverage PY-only arm.
The greater difference in malaria risk observed between users and non-users across all study arms indicates that nets play a crucial role in providing personal protection against malaria infection for the people using the net and that net usage needs to be maximized to realize the full potential of all nets.

Estimating the impact of transfluthrin-treated eave ribbons, Suna traps and their combination on malaria case incidence, based on semi-field and field data  Global malaria incidence has been reduced drastically since the year 2000, primarily due to the widespread use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), which kill the bloodfeeding Anopheles mosquitoes vectoring the disease in addition to protecting individuals sleeping under them from bites.
However, progress has stalled since the mid-2010s and malaria continues to kill more than half a million people globally each year.
New, complementary vector control tools are needed to further reduce the residual malaria transmission and face a potential decline in ITN effectiveness due to insecticide resistance.
Transfluthrin-treated eave ribbons are a promising spatial repellent to protect people when they are in or around the house but not under an ITN, while the odour-baited Suna trap may present an insecticide-free means of killing mosquitoes.
In previous semi-field and field studies, we assessed the effect of the eave ribbon, the Suna trap and the combined push-pull system on mosquito-human contact and mosquito mortality.
Here, we combine this evidence and predict the malaria case incidence reduction if these interventions were deployed at a large scale in two East African transmission settings under full uncertainty quantification by use of a stochastic, individual-based simulation platform of malaria epidemiology.
Our simulations suggest that the transfluthrin-treated eave ribbon may substantially reduce malaria case incidence in settings with low-transmission or with low ITN use, especially in regions where Anopheles funestus dominates among malaria vectors and primarily uses human hosts.
In addition, people neither protected by an ITN nor the eave ribbon may experience an increase in malaria incidence at high but imperfect coverage with the eave ribbon.
The Suna trap only showed a marginal effect on case incidence and the effect of the combined push-pull system was similar to the effect of the eave ribbon alone.
Hence, the eave ribbon appears to be a promising tool in settings difficult to reach with ITNs, such as migrant agricultural workers, but deployment alongside ITNs needs to be planned with care, and ensuring the highest possible use of ITNs remains crucial.
A cluster-randomized trial of client and provider directed financial interventions to align incentives with appropriate case management in private medicine retailers: results of the TESTsmART Trial in Lagos, Nigeria  Malaria remains a major health priority in Nigeria.
Among children with fever who seek care, less than a quarter gets tested for malaria, leading to inappropriate use of the recommended treatment for malaria; Artemether Combination Therapies (ACT).
Here we test an innovative strategy to target ACT subsidies to clients seeking care in Nigerias private retail health sector who have a confirmed malaria diagnosis.
We supported point-of-care malaria testing (mRDTs) in 48 Private Medicine Retailers (PMRs) in the city of Lagos, Nigeria and randomized them to two study arms; a control arm offering subsidized mRDT testing for USD $0.66, and an intervention arm where, in addition to access to subsidized testing as in the control arm, clients who received a positive mRDT at the PMR were eligible for a free (fully subsidized) first-line ACT and PMRs received USD $0.2 for every mRDT performed.
Our primary outcome was the proportion of ACTs dispensed to individuals with a positive diagnostic test.
Secondary outcomes included proportion of clients who were tested at the PMR and adherence to diagnostic test results.
Overall, 23% of clients chose to test at the PMR.
Test results seemed to inform treatment decisions and resulted in enhanced targeting of ACTs to confirmed malaria cases with only 26% of test-negative clients purchasing an ACT compared to 58% of untested clients.
We found that ACT subsidies were not passed on to clients testing positive in the intervention arm.
We conclude that RDTs could reduce ACT overconsumption in Nigerias private retail health sector, but PMR-oriented incentive structures are difficult to implement and may need to be complemented with interventions targeting clients of PMRs to increase test uptake and adherence.

Optimizing test and treat options for vivax malaria: an options assessment toolkit (OAT) for Asia Pacific National Malaria Control Programs  IntroductionDesigning policy in public health is a complex process requiring decision making that incorporates available evidence and is suitable to a countrys epidemiological and health system context.
The main objective of this study was to develop an options assessment toolkit (OAT) to provide a pragmatic and evidence-based approach to the development of policies for the radical cure (prevention of relapse) of vivax malaria for national malaria control programs in the Asia-Pacific region.
Materials and methodsThe OAT was developed using participatory research methods and a Delphi process using a sequential multi-phase design, adapted with a pre-development phase, a development phase, and a final development phase.
In the pre-development phase, a literature review was conducted to inform the toolkit development.
Data collection in the development phase consisted of core research team discussions, multiple rounds of consultation with participants from National Malaria Control Programs (NMP) (online and in person), and two separate modified e-Delphi processes with experts.
The final development phase was the piloting of the toolkit during the annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Malaria Elimination Network (APMEN) Vivax Working Group.
ResultsWe developed a tool kit containing the following elements: i) Baseline Assessment Tool (BAT) to assess the readiness of NMPs for new or improved coverage of radical cure, ii) eight scenarios representative of Asia Pacific region, iii) matching test and treat options based on available options for G6PD testing and radical cure for the given scenarios, iv) an approaches tool to allow NMPs to visualize considerations for policy change process and different implementation strategies/approaches for each test and treat option.
ConclusionsThe OAT can support vivax radical cure policy formulation among NMPs and stakeholders tailoring for their unique country context.
Future studies are needed to assess the utility and practicality of using the OAT for specific country context.
Diagnostic accuracy of the Point-of-Care Standard G6PD test™ (SD Biosensor) for Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency: a systematic review of the literature  Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd) is a common genetic enzymopathy that can induce hemolysis triggered by various factors, including some anti-malarial drugs.
Although many Point-of-Care (PoC) tests, such as STANDARD G6PDTM manufactured by SD biosensor (StandG6PD-BS), are available to detect G6PDd, its pooled diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) remains unknown.
To estimate the DTA of StandG6PD-BS at various thresholds of G6PDd, we conducted a systematic review with a DTA meta-analysis, searching EMBASE, MEDLINE, and SciELO databases up to June 30, 2023.
We included studies measuring G6PD activity using StandG6PD-BS (reference test) and spectrophotometry (gold standard) in patients suspected of having G6PDd.
We assessed the risk of bias (RoB) of the studies using the QUADAS-2 tool and the certainty of evidence (CoE) with the GRADE approach.
Our approach included the estimation of within-study DTA, a random-effect bivariate meta-analysis to determine the pooled sensitivity and specificity for 30%, 70%, and 80% enzyme levels thresholds, and a graphical analysis of the heterogeneity using crosshair and Confidence Regions on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space plots.
After screening 2,407 reports, we included four studies with 7,864 participants covering all thresholds.
Two studies had high RoB in QUADAS-2 domains 2 and 3, and the others had low RoB.
We also found low, moderate, and high heterogeneity at the 30%, 70%, and 80% thresholds, respectively.
The pooled sensitivity was 99.1% (95%CI 96.9-99.7%, CoE: high), 95.7% (92.0-97.0%, high), and 90% (78.0-96.5%, low) for 30%, 70%, and 80% thresholds, respectively.
The pooled specificity was 97.4% (95%CI 95.0; 98.4%, high); 92.9% (85.0-96.4%, high); and 89.0% (76.0-96.0%, moderate) for 30%, 70%, and 80% thresholds, respectively.
In conclusion, StandG6PD-BS is a PoC test with high sensitivity and specificity to detect G6PDd at different thresholds.
Author summaryGlucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd) is a common genetic disease that can induce the destruction of red blood cells leading to anemia triggered by various factors, including some drugs used for malaria treatment.
After a literature search in different databases up to January 31, 2023, we pooled diagnostic test accuracy of the Point-of-Care (PoC) STANDARD G6PDTM test manufactured by SD biosensor (StandG6PD-BS) used to identify the G6PDd.
Although two of the four studies included showed a high Risk of Bias related to the index test and the reference standard domains of the QUADAS-2 tool, the pooled sensitivity and specificity for 30%, 70%, and 80% enzyme levels thresholds were around 90%, with better sensitivity and specificity values for the 30% threshold (99.1% and 97.4%) compared with 70% (95.7% and 92.9%) and 80% (90% and 89%) threshold.
We found low, moderate, and high heterogeneity at the 30%, 70%, and 80% thresholds.

Association between altitude and death from COVID-19 in subjects with diabetes mellitus during the first wave: cross sectional study of the National Death Index  BackgroundIn high Andean areas, there is greater insulin sensitivity which may be a protective factor against complications in subjects with diabetes mellitus.
ObjectiveDetermine the association between altitude of residence and death from COVID-19 in deaths with diabetes mellitus in Peru during the first wave..  MethodsWe carried out a cross-sectional analysis of deaths registered in the National Death System of Peru (SINADEF in Spanish).
We selected Peruvians with diabetes mellitus identified by presenting the diagnosis in any of the six boxes on the certificate.
The dependent variable was death from COVID-19 as the basic cause of death, located in last place among causes A, B, C and D according to the Pan American Health Organization.
The independent variable was the altitude of residence, categorized as less than 1 500 m a.s.l, 1 500 to 2 499 m a.s.l.
and greater than 2 500 m a.sl.
Through a multilevel analysis by geographic region and using a Poisson regression, we obtained the risk ratios of death from COVID-19 according to the altitude of residence.
ResultsWe included 16 406 deaths with diabetes mellitus between March-December 2020.
34.3% died from Covid19 and 9.7% came from areas above 2 500 m. The proportion of deaths from COVID-19 of those with residence altitude above 2 500 m was 20% lower compared to residents below 1 500 m (RR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.70 - 0.91; p<0.001), adjusted for individual and socioeconomic factors.
Its influence is also shown as the altitude changes every 100, 250, 500 and 1000 m a.s.l., through multilevel analysis.
ConclusionA higher altitude of residence is associated with a lower proportion of deaths from COVID-19 in people with diabetes mellitus during the first wave in Peru.
The study contribute to expanding knowledge of the effects of altitude with respect to mortality in people with diabetes mellitus in a context of a highly contagious and virulent infectious disease.
Little disease but lots of bites: social, urbanistic, mobility, and entomological risk factors of human exposure to Aedes aegypti in South Texas, U.S.  BackgroundAedes aegypti presence, human-vector contact rates, and Aedes-borne virus transmission are highly variable through time and space.
The Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV), Texas, is one of the few regions in the U.S. where local transmission of Aedes-borne viruses occurs, presenting an opportunity to evaluate social, urbanistic, entomological, and mobility-based factors that modulate human exposure to Ae.
Methodology & Principal FindingsMosquitoes were collected using BG-Sentinel 2 traps during November 2021 as part of an intervention trial, with knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) and housing quality surveys to gather environmental and demographic data.
Human blood samples were taken from individuals and a Bitemark Assay (ELISA) was conducted to quantify human antibodies to the Ae.
aegypti Nterm-34kDa salivary peptide as a measure of human exposure to bites.
In total, 64 houses were surveyed with 142 blood samples collected.
More than 80% of participants had knowledge of mosquito-borne diseases and believed mosquitoes to be a health risk in their community.
Our best fit generalized linear mixed effects model found four fixed effects contributed significantly to explaining the variation in exposure to Ae.
aegypti bites: higher annual household income, younger age, larger lot area, and higher female Ae.
aegypti abundance per trap night averaged over 5 weeks prior to human blood sampling.
ConclusionsMost surveyed residents recognized mosquitoes and the threat they pose to individual and public health.
Urbanistic (i.e., lot size), social (i.e., income within a low-income community and age), and entomological (i.e., adult female Ae.
aegypti abundance) factors modulate the risk of human exposure to Ae.
aegypti bites.
The use of serological biomarker assays, such as the Bitemark Assay, are valuable tools for surveillance and risk assessment of mosquito-borne disease, especially in areas like the LRGV where the transmission of target pathogens is low or intermittent.
Author SummaryAedes aegypti is a mosquito vector with public health importance on the global scale as it transmits viruses such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika.
Although transmission rates of dengue and Zika are low in the U.S., there are a few regions, including south Texas, where local transmission has occurred.
Our study aimed to evaluate the factors associated with risk of exposure to these viruses using a serological bioassay that measured antibody response to an Ae.
aegypti salivary protein to assess human-vector contact.
We collected mosquitoes, took human-blood samples, and conducted urbanistic and demographic surveys in November 2021 in eight communities in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, Texas.
Our knowledge, attitude, and practices survey found that most residents recognized adult mosquitoes, though few individuals knew someone personally who been sick with a mosquito-borne disease.
Outdoor adult female Ae.
aegypti abundance was positively associated with exposure to mosquito bites.
The Bitemark Assay we used in this study can be utilized as a tool for entomological risk assessment and could be used as an alternative to infection exposure in areas where mosquito-borne disease levels are low.
Assessing the performance of Laboratory professionals following a day of malaria microscopy training in Kano, Nigeria  Malaria is a global health burden with a projection of 247 million cases in 2021 in 84 countries known to be malaria-endemic.
The majority of the cases are expected to occur in WHO African Region countries inclusive of Nigeria where the disease is a public health concern particularly in the northern regions.
This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a one-day malaria microscopy training program for laboratory professionals in Kano, Nigeria, and to assess the impact of the training on their proficiency in detecting malaria parasites.
A total of 56 medical laboratory professionals from both public and private healthcare facilities participated in the training, which was based on the WHO basic microscopy learners guide.
Participants knowledge was assessed before and after the training using a pre-test and post-test survey, and their proficiency in malaria diagnosis was evaluated through the examination of a panel of stained blood slides.
The sensitivity and specificity of the participants in detecting malaria parasites were determined as 66% and 34% respectively, indicating moderate sensitivity but very low specificity.
A significant improvement in participants knowledge of malaria detection was observed post-training, with private facilities showing a median knowledge score increase from 47.5% to 65.0%, and public facilities from 55.0% to 70.0%.
The study highlighted the need for enhanced training and standardization in malaria microscopy to improve diagnostic accuracy.
Despite the moderate increase in knowledge and sensitivity post-training, the low specificity and agreement underscore the importance of ongoing education and quality assurance measures in malaria diagnosis, especially in high-prevalence settings like Kano.
A Systematic Review on Malaria and Tuberculosis (TB) Vaccine Challenges in Sub-Saharan African Clinical Trials  ObjectiveFor more than a century, developing novel and effective vaccines against malaria and tuberculosis (TB) infections has been a challenge.
This review sought to investigate the reasons for the slow progress of malaria and TB vaccine candidates in sub-Saharan African clinical trials.
MethodsThe systematic review protocol was registered on PROSPERO on July 26, 2023 (CRD42023445166).
The research articles related to the immunogenicity, efficacy, or safety of malaria or TB vaccines that were published between January 1, 2012, and August 31, 2023, were searched on three databases: Web of Science (WoS), PubMed, and ClinicalTrials.gov.
ResultsA total of 2342 articles were obtained, 50 of which met the inclusion criteria.
28 (56%) articles reported on malaria vaccine attributes, while 22 (44%) articles reported on TB vaccines.
ConclusionFactors such as population characteristics, pathogen genetic diversity, vaccine nature, strategy, and formulation were associated with slow progress of the malaria and TB vaccine candidates in sub-Saharan African clinical trials.
Author summaryVaccines are one of the most powerful control strategies for both infectious and non-infectious diseases.
The lack of durable vaccines and the development of antimicrobial resistance have made malaria and TB threats to human lives, specifically in sub-Saharan Africa.
The search for novel, reliable, and durable vaccines against these infections has been underway for more than a decade.
The results of the study are crucial for the identification of areas for improvement in vaccine design, evaluation, and implementation strategies, hence driving advancements in NTD vaccine research and development.
TEMPORAL SPATIALIZATION AS A STRATEGY FOR URBAN MANAGEMENT IN CONTROLLING DISEASES TRANSMITTED BY MOSQUITOES  Due to their ecophysiological ability to adapt to new environments, combined with climate change, mosquitoes that vector dengue fever and other arboviruses are increasingly expanding their areas of infestation.
Dengue fever has shown growth across the planet, reaching countries and regions that were previously free of this disease.
This research aims to demonstrate how the temporal spatialization of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes can contribute to urban management in controlling these types of illnesses in small cities.
Mapping under-five mortality in Malawi: towards achieving sustainable development goals  As many low- and middle-income countries continue making gains towards attaining sustainable development goals in under-five mortality, surveillance of mortality outcomes and indicators at the sub-district level will become important as national- and district-level estimates may mask areas with a high burden.
Spatial statistical modelling techniques such as geostatistical prevalence mapping can play a role in identifying hotspots of relatively high under-five mortality.
To achieve this objective, it is necessary to combine data from multiple sources with different spatial resolutions to produce maps that reveal these hotspot clusters.
We pooled DHS, high-resolution census data, economic vulnerability, and malaria risk data to estimate under-five mortality at a sub-district level in Malawi.
Using a Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach, we fitted a binomial generalized linear geostatistical model with local area effects to generate estimates of under-five mortality at a sub-district level in Malawi.
Results, in general, showed low mortality rates across the country with pockets of locations mostly in northern Malawi showing elevated risk.
Rural locations were associated with higher odds of under-five mortality compared to urban locations.
Our study provides a better understanding of progress made after the Millennium Development Goals in 2015 and can help improve surveillance through the application of targeted interventions which can lead to the attainment of sustainable development goals by 2030.
Time analysis of dengue deaths that occurred in two regions of Peru during the climatic-atmospheric phenomena El Nino Costero and Cyclone Yaku  OBJECTIVETo perform a dengue-related death time analysis that occurred in Piura and Ica (Peru) during the atmospheric phenomena of El Nino Costero and Cyclone Yaku in 2023.
MATERIAL AND METHODSA case-series study was performed.
We included the deaths between January 1 and June 3, 2023.
A time analysis was performed from the date of onset of symptoms, date of first visit at a health establishment, date that dengue diagnosis was first registered and date of death.
RESULTSWe included 40 deaths by dengue in the study.
70% were females, the median age of death was 51 years of age, and 70% came from Piura.
51.2% presented some comorbidity and 14% had self-medicated with metamizole, other NSAIDS or corticoids before the initial medical consultation.
37.5% presented an unconventional clinical pattern at admission and dengue was not suspected in 40% during the initial assessment.
The median time until the initial assessment, the diagnosis time, and the time from diagnosis until death were 3 days, 0 days, and 1 day, respectively.
Adults presented a time until the initial assessment significantly greater than the other age groups (p=0.048), the diagnosis time was significantly less than those seen at the Health Department establishments and regional government establishments (MINSA/GORE) than in private establishments (p=0.014) and greater in pediatrics (p=0.018).
The time from diagnosis until death was significantly less in those that self-medicated before the initial assessment (p=0.041).
CONCLUSIONThe adults presented a significantly greater time until the initial assessment; the diagnosis time was less than those seen in MINSA/GORE establishments and greater in pediatrics, furthermore, the time from diagnosis until death was significantly less in those who self-medicated before the initial assessment.
An important fraction of deaths presented comorbidities and an unconventional clinical pattern at admission, with dengue frequently not suspected during the initial assessment.
Risk factors for anaemia among pregnant women: A cross-sectional study in Upper East Region, Ghana  BackgroundAnaemia in pregnancy (AIP) is a public health concern due to its devastating effects on women and their unborn babies, resulting in increased maternal and neonatal deaths in developing countries.
Despite several Ghanaian health policies to combat AIP, AIP is still on the rise.
However, Kassena Nankana West District (KNWD) in the Upper East Region of Ghana lacks a study on anaemia risk factors, therefore, this study estimated the prevalence and risk factors for anaemia among pregnant women in the district.
MethodsA household-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 376 pregnant women in their third trimester from February to March 2023.
Anthropometric, obstetric, sociodemographic, and health facility resource characteristics were collected using structured questionnaires and antenatal records.
Mixed-effect logistic regression was used to identify independent factors of anaemia at 95% confidence interval.
ResultsPrevalence of AIP was 53.9%.
Mild, moderate, and severe anaemia prevalence was 16.9%, 35.3%, and 1.7% respectively.
Malaria infection during pregnancy (aOR=1.563; 95%CI:1.087 - 2.475) and accessing health facilities without trained laboratory personnel (aOR=5.271; 95%CI:1.641 - 16.93) were associated with increased odds of AIP.
Belonging to the major ethnic group (aOR=0.431; 95%CI:0.280 - 0.675), accessing health facilities without laboratory services (aOR=0.151; 95%CI:0.047 - 0.487), and accessing health facilities without sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine drugs (aOR=0.234; 95%CI:0.061 - 0.897) in KNWD were also associated with decreased odds of AIP.
ConclusionAIP prevalence remains high in the KNWD.
Maternal and health facility-related factors were responsible for anaemia in the district.
Therefore, health facility strengthening and enhanced strategies for malaria prevention are recommended for anaemia control in the district.
Shifting Geographical Transmission Patterns: Characterizing the 2023 Fatal Dengue Outbreak in Bangladesh  In 2023, Bangladesh experienced its largest and deadliest outbreak of Dengue virus (DENV), reporting the highest-ever recorded annual cases and deaths.
We aimed to characterize the geographical transmission of the DENV in Bangladesh.
From 1 Jan - 31 Dec 2023, we extracted and analyzed daily data on dengue cases and deaths from the national Management Information System (MIS).
We performed a generalized linear mixed model to identify the associations between division-wise daily dengue counts and various geographical and meteorological covariates.
The number of Dengue cases reported in 2023 was 1.3 times higher than the total number recorded in the past 23 years (321,179 vs. 244,246), with twice as many deaths than the total fatalities recorded in the past 23 years (1705 vs. 849).
The number of Dengue cases reported in 2023 was 1.3 times higher than the total number recorded in the past 23 years (321,179 vs. 244,246), with twice as many deaths than the total fatalities recorded in the past 23 years (1705 vs. 849).
The number of Dengue cases reported in 2023 was 1.3 times higher than the total number recorded in the past 23 years (321,179 vs. 244,246), with twice as many deaths than the total fatalities recorded in the past 23 years (1705 vs. 849).
Of the 1705 deaths in 2023, 67.4% (n=1015) expired within one day after hospital admission.
The divisions southern to Dhaka had a higher dengue incidence/1000 population (2.30 vs. 0.50, p<0,0.01), and higher mean annual temperatures (27.46 vs. 26.54 {degrees}C) than the northern divisions.
The divisions southern to Dhaka had a higher dengue incidence/1000 population (2.30 vs. 0.50, p<0,0.01), and higher mean annual temperatures (27.46 vs. 26.54 {degrees}C) than the northern divisions.
The divisions southern to Dhaka had a higher dengue incidence/1000 population (2.30 vs. 0.50, p<0,0.01), and higher mean annual temperatures (27.46 vs. 26.54 {degrees}C) than the northern divisions.
The average daily temperature (IRR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.11-1.14), urban and rural population ratio of the divisions (IRR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.03-1.04), showed a positive, and rainfall (IRR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.98-0.99) showed a negative association with dengue cases in each division.
We observed a major geographical shift of Dengue cases from the capital city Dhaka to different districts of Bangladesh with a higher incidence of dengue in the southern division of Bangladesh, influenced by temperature and urbanization.
Unraveling varying spatiotemporal patterns of dengue and associated exposure-response relationships with environmental variables in Southeast Asian countries before and during COVID-19  The enforcement of COVID-19 interventions by diverse governmental bodies, coupled with the indirect impact of COVID-19 on short-term environmental changes (e.g.
plant shutdowns lead to lower greenhouse gas emissions), influences the dengue vector.
This provides a unique opportunity to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on dengue transmission and generate insights to guide more targeted prevention measures.
We aim to compare dengue transmission patterns and the exposure-response relationship of environmental variables and dengue incidence in the pre- and during-COVID-19 to identify variations and assess the impact of COVID-19 on dengue transmission.
We initially visualized the overall trend of dengue transmission from 2012-2022, then conducted two quantitative analyses to compare dengue transmission pre-COVID-19 (2017-2019) and during-COVID-19 (2020-2022).
These analyses included time series analysis to assess dengue seasonality, and a Distributed Lag Non-linear Model (DLNM) to quantify the exposure-response relationship between environmental variables and dengue incidence.
We observed that all subregions in Thailand exhibited remarkable synchrony with a similar annual trend except 2021.
Cyclic and seasonal patterns of dengue remained consistent pre- and during-COVID-19.
Monthly dengue incidence in three countries varied significantly.
Singapore witnessed a notable surge during-COVID-19, particularly from May to August, with cases multiplying several times compared to pre-COVID-19, while seasonality of Malaysia weakened.
Exposure-response relationships of dengue and environmental variables show varying degrees of change, notably in Northern Thailand, where the peak relative risk for the maximum temperature-dengue relationship rose from about 3 to 17, and the max RR of overall cumulative association 0-3 months of relative humidity increased from around 5 to 55.
Our study is the first to compare dengue transmission patterns and their relationship with environmental variables before and during COVID-19, showing that COVID-19 has affected dengue transmission at both the national and regional level, and has altered the exposure-response relationship between dengue and the environment.
Author SummaryDengue fever is a typical tropical disease transmitted via mosquito bites.
COVID-19 lockdowns have altered human-mosquito contact patterns that impacted dengue transmission.
Additionally, lockdowns caused short-term environmental changes that affected dengue vector breeding.
In fact, during the COVID-19 period, the normal prevention and treatment of dengue in many dengue-endemic countries was negatively affected due to the sweep of COVID-19, such as strained allocation of medical resources and misreporting of cases.
Therefore, this offers a unique chance to study the impact of COVID-19 on dengue transmission, guiding targeted and reasonable prevention measures.
We used a series of analytical approaches including time series analysis, space-time scan statistics, and distributed lag non-linear model to compare the differences in dengue transmission patterns and its exposure-response relationships with four environmental variables (average monthly precipitation, average monthly relative humidity, monthly maximum temperature, and monthly minimum temperature) before and during COVID-19 in three Southeast Asian countries: Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand at the province scale.
We found that the dengue transmission pattern and its relationship with the environmental variables changed differently.
For instance, seasonality and infections heightened in Singapore during COVID-19 and peak relative risk between max temperature and dengue has rose significantly in Northern Thailand.
First Phase 1b, single-center, age de-escalation trial of the P. falciparum blood-stage malaria vaccine candidate RH5.1/Matrix-M™: a delayed boost regimen induces high levels of functional antibodies in 5-17 month old Tanzanian infants  BackgroundRH5.1 is a soluble protein vaccine candidate for blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum malaria, previously trialed in healthy UK adults in combination with AS01B adjuvant.
Here, RH5.1 was formulated with Matrix-M adjuvant to assess safety and immunogenicity in a malaria-endemic adult and pediatric population for the first time.
MethodsWe conducted a Phase 1b, single-center, dose-escalation, age de-escalation, first-in-human trial of RH5.1/Matrix-M in Bagamoyo, Tanzania.
Healthy adults (18-45 years) and infants (5-17 months) were recruited to receive the RH5.1/Matrix-M vaccine candidate in a variety of dosing regimens, including monthly dosing (0-1-2 month) or delayed booster dosing (0-1-6 month) using a 10 {micro}g dose of RH5.1, or delayed fractional booster dosing (0-1-6 month) with the first two doses of RH5.1 at 50 {micro}g and the third dose at 10 {micro}g. All RH5.1 protein doses were formulated with 50 {micro}g Matrix-M adjuvant.
Primary outcomes for vaccine safety included solicited and unsolicited adverse events after each vaccination, along with any serious adverse events (SAEs) during the study period.
Secondary outcome measures for immunogenicity included the concentration and avidity of anti-RH5.1 serum IgG antibodies by ELISA and their percentage growth inhibition activity (GIA) in vitro against P. falciparum parasites using purified IgG.
All participants receiving at least one dose of vaccine were included in the primary analyses.
FindingsBetween 25th January 2021 and 15th April 2021 a total of 60 adults and infants were enrolled; 57 of these completed the vaccination series, and 55 completed 22 months of follow-up post-third vaccination.
Vaccinations were well-tolerated across both age groups.
There were five SAEs involving four infant participants during the trial, none of which were deemed related to vaccination.
RH5-specific T cell and serum antibody responses were induced by vaccination.
The anti-RH5 serum IgG responses were significantly higher in the 5-17 month old infant groups as compared to adults.
Serum antibody responses contracted over time post-third vaccination, but a similar hierarchy of responses across the age groups was maintained after 22 months follow-up (674 days post-third vaccination).
Vaccine-induced anti-RH5 antibodies showed in vitro GIA with comparable functional quality across all age groups and dosing regimens.
The highest anti-RH5 serum IgG responses were observed post-third vaccination in the 5-17 month old infants vaccinated with the 0-1-6 month delayed booster regimen using the 10 {micro}g dose of RH5.1 (median 723 {micro}g/mL; range: 450-1436 {micro}g/mL), resulting in 100 % (11/11 infants) showing >60 % GIA following dilution of total IgG to 2.5 mg/mL (median 88 %; range: 73-97 %).
InterpretationThe RH5.1/Matrix-M vaccine candidate shows an acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile and highly promising antibody immunogenicity in 5-17 month old infants residing in a malaria-endemic area.
The 0-1-6 month delayed booster regimen in 5-17 month old infants induced the highest levels of functional GIA reported to-date following human vaccination, with all infants achieving a level of GIA previously associated with protective outcome against blood-stage P. falciparum challenge in non-human primates.
These data support onward efficacy assessment of this vaccine candidate against clinical malaria in young African infants.

Quality of care when using a digital clinical decision support algorithm to manage sick children at primary care health facilities in Tanzania: a cross-sectional cluster randomized controlled trial (DYNAMIC study)  Digital clinical decision support tools have contributed to improved quality of care at primary care level health facilities.
However, data from real-world randomized trials are lacking.
We conducted a cluster randomized, open-label trial in Tanzania evaluating the use of a digital clinical decision support algorithm (CDSA), enhanced by point-of-care tests, training and mentorship, compared with usual care, among sick children 2 to 59 months old presenting to primary care facilities for an acute illness in Tanzania (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05144763).
The primary outcome was the mean proportion of 14 major Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) symptoms and signs assessed by clinicians.
Secondary outcomes included antibiotic prescription, counselling provided, and the appropriateness of antimalarial and antibiotic prescriptions.
A total of 450 consultations were observed in 9 intervention and 9 control health facilities.
The mean proportion of major symptoms and signs assessed in intervention health facilities was 46.4% (range 7.7% to 91.7%) compared to 26.3% (range 0% to 66.7%) in control health facilities, an adjusted difference of 15.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.8% to 25.4%).
Only weight, height, and pallor were assessed more often when using the digital CDSA than in controls.
Observed antibiotic prescription was 37.3% in intervention facilities, and 76.4% in control facilities (adjusted risk ratio 0.5; 95% CI 0.4 to 0.7; p<0.001).
Appropriate antibiotic prescription was 81.9% in intervention facilities and 51.4% in control facilities (adjusted risk ratio 1.5; 95% CI 1.2 to 1.8; p=0.003).
The implementation of a digital CDSA improved only slightly the mean proportion of IMCI symptoms and signs assessed in consultations with sick children, and most symptoms and signs were assessed infrequently.
Nonetheless, antibiotics were prescribed less often, and more appropriately Innovative approaches to overcome barriers related to clinicians motivation and work environment are needed.

Author SummaryThe monkey malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi has been found to increasingly infect humans across Southeast Asia via the bite of its anopheline mosquito vectors.
Human infections with a similar monkey parasite, Plasmodium cynomologi, have also been reported.
The diagnostic tools commonly used to detect these malaria species are often unable to detect very low-level infections.
We aimed to to improve surveillance detection tools and blood sample collection methods to detect these zoonotic malaria species and understand the extent of transmission and the burden of disease.
We found that with the use of reverse transcription, large improvements in the limit of detection were possible, by up to 10,000-fold for initial malaria screening, and up to 2759-fold for specific P. knowlesi detection.
Findings from this study support the use of ultrasensitive detection tools to improve surveillance approaches to emerging zoonotic malaria species.
Adverse outcomes and their predictors of dengue fever in pregnancy; a cross sectional study with a follow up  ObjectiveDengue infection is a significant health issue in tropical areas over the globe.
Physiological changes of pregnancy can be confounding the clinical presentation of dengue in pregnancy.
This study aimed to investigate the adverse outcomes of antenatal dengue infection and factors associated with maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications.
MethodsA total of 115 pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed dengue infection admitted to two tertiary referral hospitals in Sri Lanka were followed from admission until delivery and discharge.
Data on clinical and laboratory outcome variables were collected and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.
ResultsDengue fever accounted for the majority of cases (63.5%), followed by dengue hemorrhagic fever (33.9%) and, dengue expanded syndrome (2.6%).
Maternal adverse outcomes were observed in 27.8% of cases with 19.1% of ICU admissions.
Dengue category, trimester of infection, platelet count, and AST levels showed a significant association with adverse maternal outcomes.
Fetal adverse outcomes affected 8.1% of cases, while neonatal adverse outcomes occurred in 28.7% of live births, with transplacental transmission observed in two cases.
Association of current Schistosoma mansoni, S. japonicum, and S. mekongi infection status and intensity with periportal fibrosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis  BackgroundPeriportal fibrosis (PPF) is a severe morbidity caused by both current and past exposure to intestinal schistosomes.
Association of current Schistosoma mansoni, S. japonicum, and S. mekongi infection status and intensity with periportal fibrosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis  BackgroundPeriportal fibrosis (PPF) is a severe morbidity caused by both current and past exposure to intestinal schistosomes.
We assessed the association between current/active infection status and intensity of Schistosoma mansoni, S. japonicum, or S. mekongi with PPF.
We assessed the association between current/active infection status and intensity of Schistosoma mansoni, S. japonicum, or S. mekongi with PPF.
A meta-analysis to derive pooled effect sizes for concurrently measured current schistosome infection status and intensity against author-defined PPF was conducted using inverse-variance weighted random effects.
Subgroup analyses by study characteristics and risk of bias assessments using a modified National Institute of Health Risk of Bias Tool were completed.
The protocol was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022333919).
FindingsWe identified 2646 records; 37 studies were included in the systematic review and 30 studies in the meta-analysis.
S. mansoni was most studied (91{middle dot}89%; 34/37).
PPF was heterogeneously defined with the Niamey ultrasound protocol commonly used for diagnosis.
Individuals with any current infection were 2{middle dot}50 (95% CI:1{middle dot}71-3{middle dot}66) times more likely to have PPF compared to uninfected individuals with high heterogeneity (I2 statistic 94{middle dot}80%).
Subgroup analyses showed there was no association when only ultrasound patterns or modified Niamey Protocols were used.
There was no association in studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa after 2002 when mass drug administration became widespread, or in studies with a low risk of bias.
No significant association was found between schistosome infection intensity and PPF.
InterpretationWorld Health Organization guidelines use current schistosome infection intensity as a proxy for schistosomiasis-related morbidity.
This study supports that only current infection status was tenuously associated with PPF.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPeriportal fibrosis (PPF) is a severe complication of intestinal schistosomiasis.
The broad search terms were "Schistosoma", "fibrosis" AND "periportal OR liver".
Three reviews were detected by the search string; these detailed how human genetics influence fibrosis outcomes, non-invasive methods of periportal fibrosis in schistosomiasis patients, and human host regulation of liver fibrosis during schistosome infection.
Outside this search string, reviews exploring the impact of co-infections on liver morbidity (Hepatitis B/C and malaria), the use of ultrasonography for assessing morbidity, and the impact of chemotherapy on liver morbidity were identified or in progress.
No review had assessed the impact of current intestinal schistosome infection status or intensity on PPF outcomes.
Added value of this studyHere we provide quantitative evidence for the influence of (or lack thereof) current Schistosoma mansoni, S. japonicum, and S. mekongi infection status and intensity on PPF while presenting the risk of bias in the available literature.
Added value of this studyHere we provide quantitative evidence for the influence of (or lack thereof) current Schistosoma mansoni, S. japonicum, and S. mekongi infection status and intensity on PPF while presenting the risk of bias in the available literature.
By synthesising data ranging from 1988-2020 encompassing 17317 participants, across all age ranges, we found that individuals with current schistosome infection were 2{middle dot}50 times more likely to have PPF when compared to individuals who are not currently infected.
Heterogeneity was high (>90%) across studies and was not reduced when moderate or high risk of bias studies were excluded.
The association of current schistosome infection status was tenuous, determined solely by unadjusted studies that ignored cofounders and were conducted prior to mass drug administration.
The association was observed only in moderate to high risk of bias studies and not present in low risk of bias studies.
Importantly, we found no significant association between the intensity of current schistosome infections and PPF with very few studies available on current infection intensity.
Implications of all the available evidenceCurrent World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines focus on reducing schistosomiasis-related morbidity as approximated by community prevalence cut-offs set based on only current schistosome infection intensity.
This meta-analysis provides evidence that those currently infected with schistosomes had an increased likelihood of having PPF, but only when infection status was considered rather than infection intensity.
The high heterogeneity found among studies presented here suggests the need for standardisation of PPF diagnosis to accurately estimate the global burden of this disease in the future.
Our findings suggest that in the current context of widespread, repeated mass drug administration infection proxy indicators are poor estimates of severe morbidity related to schistosomal liver fibrosis.
Guidelines or recommendations are needed now from the WHO to assist endemic countries on how to directly monitor schistosomiasis-related morbidities as opposed to monitoring current infections while considering existing local resources and health system constraints.
Impact of seasonal malaria chemoprevention timing on clinical malaria incidence dynamics in the Kedougou region, Senegal  Seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine is recommended by the World Health Organization since 2012 for clinical malaria prevention in children in the Sahelian region of Africa.
In Senegal, SMC implementation began in 2013 and is given to children under 10 years old.
This study aimed to describe clinical malaria incidence in the general population during routine SMC implementation and to analyse how SMC timing impacted clinical malaria dynamics in eligible children.
We conducted an ecological study in the Kedougou region of Senegal in 27 villages included in the Bandafassi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS).
We calculated weekly Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence by age group using malaria case data recorded by community health workers and health-posts, and population denominators obtained from Bandafassi Health and Demographic Surveillance System.
We used negative binomial generalized additive multilevel models to analyse the incidence of clinical episodes in children under 10 years during the expected SMC prophylactic period and at the end of the transmission period.
Malaria incidence was strongly seasonal with a high transmission period starting in June.
Children under SMC presented an overall lower incidence compared to older children and young adults.
Among children eligible for SMC, the incidence was lowest for approximately 3 weeks after treatment administration and increased subsequently, suggesting a gradual loss of protection.
At the end of the high transmission period, a higher malaria incidence was recorded from the 3rd to 6th week after the week of administration of the fourth (final) SMC round.
The addition of a 5th round of SMC in 2023 was necessary to cover the end of the transmission season, but individual-level studies are required to ensure that drug efficacy and adequate dosing are maintained.
Modelling to support decisions about the geographic and demographic extensions of seasonal malaria chemoprevention in Benin  BackgroundSeasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) has been implemented yearly in northern Benin since 2019 to reduce the malaria burden in children under 5 years of age.
Its geographic scope was progressively extended until in 2022 two different extensions of SMC were considered: either demographic - children aged 5 to 10 in the currently targeted departments would also receive SMC, or geographic to children under 5 in new eligible departments to the south.
As SMC had neither been implemented in the areas nor age groups suggested for expansion, modelling was used to compare the likely impact of both extensions.
MethodsThe model OpenMalaria was calibrated to represent the history of malaria interventions and transmission risk in Benin.
ResultsThe model predicted that between 2024 and 2026 the geographic extension of SMC would avert at least four times more severe malaria cases and five times more direct malaria deaths per targeted child than the demographic extension.
However, numbers of severe cases averted per targeted child were similar between health zones eligible for geographic extension.
Health zones were prioritised by availability of community health workers to deliver SMC.
Mathematical modelling was a supportive tool to understand the relative impact of the different proposed SMC extensions and contributed to the decision-making process.
Effects of climatic variables on dengue incidence in Cali  In this work we studied the relationship between dengue incidence in Cali and the climatic variables that are known to have an impact on the mosquito and were available (precipitation, relative humidity, minimum, mean, and maximum temperature).
Since the natural processes of the mosquito imply that any changes on climatic variables need some time to be visible on the dengue incidence, a lagged correlation analysis was done in order to choose the predictor variables of count regression models.
A Principal Component Analysis was done to reduce dimensionality and study the correlation among the climatic variables.
Finally, aiming to predict the monthly dengue incidence, three different regression models were constructed and compared using de Akaike information criterion.
The best model was the negative binomial regression model, and the predictor variables were mean temperature with a 3-month lag and mean temperature with a 5-month lag as well as their interaction.
The other variables were not significant on the models.
And interesting conclusion was that according to the coefficients of the regression model, a 1{degrees}C increase in the monthly mean temperature will reflect as a 45% increase in dengue incidence after 3 months.
The rises to a 64% increase after 5 months.
In this work studied the relationship between dengue incidence in Cali and climatic variables, namely precipitation, relative humidity, minimum temperature, mean temperature, and maximum temperature using statistical methods.
Since this is a natural and biological process, the changes in climatic conditions need time to have a visible effect on dengue incidence, hence we identified the significant climatic variables and the time they take to have a visible effect on dengue incidence.
Then, we created three different models for predicting dengue incidences using the lagged variables and picked the best one.
We concluded that the most critical variable is mean temperature with a 3- and 5-month lag.
We also found that a 1{degrees}C increase in the monthly mean temperature will reflect as a 45% increase in dengue incidence after 3 months.
The rises to a 64% increase after 5 months.
The economic burden of zoonotic Plasmodium knowlesi malaria on households in Sabah, Malaysia compared to malaria from human-only Plasmodium species  BackgroundThe emergence of the zoonotic monkey parasite Plasmodium knowlesi as the dominant cause of malaria in Malaysia has disrupted current national WHO elimination goals.
Malaysia has free universal access to malaria care; however, out-of-pocket costs are unknown.
This study estimated household costs of illness attributable to malaria due to P. knowlesi against other non-zoonotic Plasmodium species infections in Sabah, Malaysia.
Methodology/Principal FindingsHousehold costs were estimated from patient-level surveys collected from four hospitals between 2013 and 2016.
Direct costs including medical and associated travel costs, and indirect costs due to lost productivity were included.
One hundred and fifty-two malaria cases were enrolled: P. knowlesi (n=108), P. vivax (n=22), P. falciparum (n=16), and P. malariae (n=6).
One hundred and fifty-two malaria cases were enrolled: P. knowlesi (n=108), P. vivax (n=22), P. falciparum (n=16), and P. malariae (n=6).
One hundred and fifty-two malaria cases were enrolled: P. knowlesi (n=108), P. vivax (n=22), P. falciparum (n=16), and P. malariae (n=6).
One hundred and fifty-two malaria cases were enrolled: P. knowlesi (n=108), P. vivax (n=22), P. falciparum (n=16), and P. malariae (n=6).
Costs were inflated to 2022 Malaysian Ringgits and reported in United States dollars (US$).
Across all cases, the mean total costs were US$138 (SD=108), with productivity losses accounting for 58% of costs (US$80; SD=73).
P. vivax had the highest mean total household cost at US$210, followed by P. knowlesi (US$127), P. falciparum (US$126), and P. malariae (US$105).
P. vivax had the highest mean total household cost at US$210, followed by P. knowlesi (US$127), P. falciparum (US$126), and P. malariae (US$105).
P. vivax had the highest mean total household cost at US$210, followed by P. knowlesi (US$127), P. falciparum (US$126), and P. malariae (US$105).
P. vivax had the highest mean total household cost at US$210, followed by P. knowlesi (US$127), P. falciparum (US$126), and P. malariae (US$105).
Most patients (80%) experienced direct health costs above 10% of monthly income, with 58 (38%) patients experiencing health spending over 25% of monthly income, consistent with catastrophic health expenditure.
Conclusions/SignificanceDespite Malaysias free health-system care for malaria, patients and families face other related medical, travel, and indirect costs.
Household out-of-pocket costs were driven by productivity losses; primarily attributed to infections in working-aged males in rural agricultural-based occupations.
Costs for P. knowlesi were comparable to P. falciparum and lower than P. vivax.
Costs for P. knowlesi were comparable to P. falciparum and lower than P. vivax.
Costs for P. knowlesi were comparable to P. falciparum and lower than P. vivax.
The higher P. vivax costs related to direct health facility costs for repeat monitoring visits given the liver-stage treatment required.
AUTHOR SUMMARYKnowlesi malaria is due to infection with a parasite transmitted by mosquitos from monkeys to humans.
Most people who are infected work or live near the forest.
It is now the major type of malaria affecting humans in Malaysia.
The recent increase of knowlesi malaria cases in humans has impacted individuals, families, and health systems in Southeast Asia.
Although the region has made substantial progress towards eliminating human-only malaria species, knowlesi malaria threatens elimination targets as traditional control measures do not address the parasite reservoir in monkeys.
The economic burden of illness due to knowlesi malaria has not previously been estimated or subsequently compared with other malaria species.
Medical costs and time off work and usual activities were substantial in patients with the four species of malaria diagnosed during the time of this study.
This research highlights the financial burden which households face when seeking care for malaria in Malaysia, despite the free treatment provided by the government.
Circulation of DENV-2 serotype associated with increased risk of cumulative incidence of severe dengue and dengue with warning signs: A 16-year retrospective study in Peru.
BackgroundDengue poses a significant public health challenge in Peru and other endemic countries worldwide.
While severe dengue is known to be associated with secondary infection at the individual level, the factors that elevate the risk of severe dengue at the population level remain poorly understood.
This study leverages over 16 years of secondary data from a Peruvian dengue surveillance system to assess which type of serotype-specific circulation is associated with an increased risk of cumulative incidence of severe dengue or dengue with warning signs (SD-DWS).
MethodologyThis is a retrospective analysis of secondary data using the Peruvian Ministry of Health databases of dengue cases and serotyping.
A mixed negative binomial regression model for repeated measures over time was employed to estimate the association between the cumulative incidence of reported SD-DWS cases per 100,000 inhabitants and serotype-specific circulation.
Crude and adjusted incidence ratios (IRR) were estimated.
Principal findingsThe study analyzed data from 2007 to 2022 across 19 regions of Peru, totaling 304 region-years.
Data from nearly 58,000 serotype identification reports and 57,966 cases of SD-DWS were analyzed.
The regions with most cumulative incidence of SD-DWS per 100,000 inhabitants during 2007 to 2022 were Madre de Dios (3859), Loreto (1518), Ucayali (1492), Tumbes (1335), and Piura (722).
The adjusted model revealed a higher risk of cumulative incidence of SD-DWS when there was specific circulation of DENV-123 (aIRR 7.57 CI 4.00 - 14.31), DENV-12 (aIRR 4.66 CI 2.57 - 8.44), DENV-23 (aIRR 3.55 CI 1.75 - 7.21), or when there was circulation of DENV-2 alone or co-circulating with other serotypes (aIRR 27.7 CI 15.46 -49.63).
ConclusionsCirculation of DENV-2 was associated with higher average incidence rate ratios of SD-DWS.
Author summaryWe investigated how the circulation of different dengue virus (DENV) serotypes are associated with the incidence of severe dengue and dengue with warning signs in Peru, a country where dengue is endemic.
We analyzed 16 years of data from the dengue surveillance system, including nearly 58,000 serotype identification reports and 57,966 cases of severe dengue and dengue with warning signs.
We found that regions with specific circulation of DENV-2, either alone or in combination with other serotypes, had higher incidence rates of severe dengue and dengue with warning signs.
Our findings highlight the importance of monitoring DENV serotype circulation to manage and prevent severe dengue, especially in regions where DENV-2 is prevalent.
Non-invasive detection of bilirubin concentrations during the first week of life in a low-resource setting along the Thailand-Myanmar border  BackgroundNeonatal hyperbilirubinaemia (NH) is a common problem worldwide and causes morbidity and mortality especially in low-resource settings.
MethodsA study was carried out at Shoklo Malaria Research Unit clinics along the Thailand-Myanmar border to evaluate a non-invasive test for diagnosis of NH in a low-resource setting.
Performance of transcutaneous bilirubinometer Drager Jaundice Meter JM-105 was assessed against routine capillary serum bilirubin testing before phototherapy during neonatal care in the first week of life.
Results were analysed by direct agreement and by various bilirubin thresholds used in clinical practice.
Total serum bilirubin was also measured in cord blood at birth and tested for prediction of hyperbilirubinaemia requiring phototherapy in the first week of life.
ResultsBetween April 2020 and May 2023, 742 neonates born at SMRU facilities were included in the study.
A total of 695 neonates provided 1 to 9 capillary blood samples for analysis of serum bilirubin (total 1244 tests) during the first week of life and performance of the transcutaneous bilirubinometer was assessed in 307 neonates who provided 687 paired transcutaneous-capillary blood tests.
Bilirubin levels were also measured in 738 cord blood samples.
Adjusted values of the transcutaneous bilirubinometer showed excellent agreement with capillary serum bilirubin concentration (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.923) and high sensitivity (>98%) at all clinical thresholds analysed across three years of sampling and multiple users.
Concentrations of bilirubin detected in cord blood were not useful in identifying neonates at risk of hyperbilirubinaemia requiring treatment.
ConclusionsThe transcutaneous bilirubinometer is a reliable tool to screen neonates and identify those needing confirmatory blood testing.
Bilirubin concentrations in cord blood are not predictive of hyperbilirubinemia in neonates.
Summary boxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSNon-invasive detection of bilirubin levels in cord blood and transcutaneously can support better clinical care of neonates at risk of hyperbilirubinaemia, especially in low resources settings.
What this study addsThis study was the first carried out in neonates of Karen and Burman ethnicity born at the Thailand-Myanmar border.
The study provides new data on the performance of a transcutaneous bilirubinometer used by locally trained birth attendants.
The results show that cord blood bilirubin levels are not predictive of hyperbilirubinaemia risk in the first days of life.
How this study might affect research, practice or policyThis study adds to the growing body of knowledge about performance and utility of non-invasive screening tools and diagnostics to improve neonatal health in low-resource settings and LMIC countries.
Evaluation of a Digital Entomological Surveillance Planning Tool for Malaria Vector Control: Three Country Mixed Methods Pilot Study  BackgroundVector control remains the principal method to prevent malaria transmission and has contributed to shrinking the malaria map.
However, such gains have stagnated across Africa, underscoring the need to tailor vector control to local drivers of transmission.
To support roll out of the ESPTs question-based entomological surveillance planning an interactive digital toolkit, eSPT, was developed.
MethodsThe eSPT was evaluated with 49 target users in Ethiopia, Malawi, and Mozambique.
The eSPT was introduced to participants through facilitated workshops.
A mixed-methods, uncontrolled, before and after study investigated the impact of the eSPT on knowledge, self-efficacy and work practices related to entomological surveillance planning.
Qualitative methods were used to explore the acceptability and utility of the eSPT.
ResultsQuantitative measures showed that the facilitated eSPT workshop increased participants knowledge and self-efficacy in question-based entomological surveillance planning.
Respondents from academic institutes, central government and international NGOs reported the eSPT to be a useful training tool and believed it could provide substantial efficiencies in the planning process.
Further user testing, customizability and compatibility with mobile devices was recommended to enhance the eSPTs usefulness as a planning tool, especially at the local government level.
A low pre-existing anti-NS1 humoral immunity to DENV is associated with microcephaly development after gestational ZIKV exposure  BackgroundGestational Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is associated with the development of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), which includes microcephaly and fetal demise.
The magnitude and quality of orthoflavivirus-specific humoral immunity have been previously linked to the development of CZS.
However, the role of ZIKV NS1-specific humoral immunity in mothers and children with prenatal ZIKV exposure and CZS remains undefined.
In addition, considering that most of the at-risk population lives in dengue virus (DENV)-endemic areas, it is not clear what is the association between pre-existing DENV NS1-specific humoral immunity and CZS.
MethodsHere, we studied 328 mothers and children with a clinical diagnosis and seropositivity for ZIKV infection during pregnancy, included during the 2015-2016 ZIKV epidemic in Colombia.
We also performed clinical evaluation and pediatric neurological follow-up.
The relative levels of circulating NS1-specific IgM and IgG against ZIKV and DENV were evaluated in mothers and children, and the association with the development of microcephaly was analyzed.
ResultsDENV and ZIKV IgG-NS1 antibodies in pregnant women were placentally transferred, and this passage and its duration in children depended on the maternal levels of the antibodies.
We reported that higher concentrations of pre-existing DENV, but not ZIKV IgG-NS1 antibodies, were associated with a reduced risk of CZS-related microcephaly.
Also, we observed that the IgM-NS1 response presents as long-term and has a minor association with poor outcomes.
ConclusionsThe development of microcephaly in children prenatally exposed to ZIKV is associated with low plasma levels of placentally transferred, pre-existing DENV IgG-NS1 antibodies.
These data are compatible with a protective role of anti-NS1 IgG antibodies against ZIKV infection during pregnancy and highlight the promising role of NS1 as an orthoflavivirus vaccine target in high-risk populations.
Methaemoglobin as a surrogate marker of primaquine antihypnozoite activity in Plasmodium vivax malaria: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis  BackgroundThe 8-aminoquinolines, primaquine and tafenoquine, are the only available drugs for the radical cure of Plasmodium vivax hypnozoites.
Prior evidence suggests that there is dose-dependent 8-aminoquinoline induced methaemoglobinaemia and that higher methaemoglobin concentrations are associated with a lower risk of P. vivax recurrence.
We undertook a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis to examine the utility of methaemoglobin as a surrogate endpoint for 8-aminoquinoline antihypnozoite activity to prevent P. vivax recurrence.
MethodsWe conducted a systematic search of Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, from 1 January 2000 to 29 September 2022 inclusive, of prospective clinical efficacy studies of acute, uncomplicated P. vivax malaria mono-infections treated with radical curative doses of primaquine.
The day 7 methaemoglobin concentration was the primary surrogate outcome of interest.
The primary clinical outcome was the time to first P. vivax recurrence between day 7 and day 120 after enrolment.
We used multivariable Cox proportional-hazards regression with site random-effects to characterise the time to first recurrence as a function of the day 7 methaemoglobin percentage (log2 transformed), adjusted for the partner schizontocidal drug, the primaquine regimen duration as a proxy for the total primaquine dose (mg/kg), the daily primaquine dose (mg/kg), and other factors.
The systematic review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023345956).
FindingsWe identified 219 P. vivax efficacy studies, of which eight provided relevant individual-level data from patients treated with primaquine; all were randomised, parallel arm clinical trials assessed as having low or moderate risk of bias.
In the primary analysis dataset, there were 1747 G6PD-normal patients enrolled from 24 study sites across 8 different countries (Indonesia, Brazil, Vietnam, Thailand, Peru, Colombia, Ethiopia, India).
We observed an increasing dose-response relationship between the daily weight-adjusted primaquine dose and day 7 methaemoglobin level.
For a given primaquine dose regimen, an observed doubling in day 7 methaemoglobin percentage was associated with an estimated 30% reduction in the risk of vivax recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.70; 95% CI = [0.57, 0.86]; p = 0.0005).
Using day 7 methaemoglobin as a surrogate endpoint for recurrence would reduce required sample sizes by approximately 40%.
ConclusionsFor a given primaquine regimen, higher methaemoglobin on day 7 was associated with a reduced risk of P. vivax recurrence.
Under our proposed causal model, this justifies the use of methaemoglobin as a surrogate endpoint for primaquine antihypnozoite activity in G6PD normal patients with P. vivax malaria.
Investigating the relationship between climatic factors and malaria transmission dynamics in Southwest states of Nigeria  BackgroundIn order to combat malaria, numerous strategic initiatives have been deployed over the years, with the goal of eliminating the disease in Nigeria.
Despite these efforts, malaria morbidity still persists across the nation, and is presently under control measures.
Various factors, encompassing both climatic and non-climatic elements, significantly impact the dynamics of malaria transmission across the country.
This study applied time series analysis methods to understand the relationship between climatic factors, particularly temperature and rainfall, and the occurrence of malaria in the Southwest area of Nigeria.
MethodsThis study analysed monthly data on documented cases of uncomplicated malaria obtained from the District Health Information System version 2, overseen by the Federal Ministry of Health.
Additionally, monthly rainfall and temperature data spanning from 2013 to 2021, acquired from the Nigeria Meteorological Agency, were analysed.
We applied univariate time series models to analyse monthly data on average temperature, rainfall, and malaria cases.
Subsequently, cross-correlation analyses were conducted to investigate the relationships between malaria case data and the corresponding rainfall and temperature patterns, following a pre-whitening process.
ResultsThe patterns of malaria transmission exhibit variability among the various states within the Southwest region of Nigeria from 2013 to 2021.
On average, Oyo State consistently recorded relatively higher temperatures compared to its neighbouring states.
Conversely, Ondo State receives a higher average monthly rainfall.
This state, similar to others in the region, experiences two distinct wet seasons, each characterised by different peak periods.
In terms of temporal relationships, it is predicted that rainfall precedes malaria cases by one month across all the states.
ConclusionThe results of this study underscore the varied characteristics of malaria transmission patterns and climate change, even across the individual states within the Southwest region of the country.
This recognition of variations in malaria transmission and climatic factors is valuable for policymakers as it enables them to strategically allocate and optimise the implementation of interventions at state-specific level, rather than at zonal level.
These interventions might involve distributing and advocating for the use of insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor residual spraying, and seasonal malaria chemoprevention tailored to the unique requirements and circumstances at the state level.
Diagnostics for detection and surveillance of priority epidemic-prone diseases in Africa: an assessment of testing capacity and laboratory strengthening needs.
In 2023, Africa experienced 180 public health emergencies, of which 90% were infectious diseases and 75% were related to zoonotic diseases.
Testing capacity for epidemic-prone diseases is essential to enable rapid and accurate identification of causative agents, and for action to prevent disease spread.
An online, self-assessment survey was conducted in African Union Member States to identify major challenges in testing for epidemic-prone diseases.
The survey assessed current capacity for diagnosing priority epidemic-prone diseases at different laboratory levels.
The survey result from 15 Member States who responded to the survey, showed high variability in testing capacity and technologies across countries and diverse factors limiting testing capacity for certain priority diseases like dengue and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever.
At the same time, there is better diagnostic capacity for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), polio, and measles due to previous investments.
Unfortunately, many countries are not utilising multiplex testing, despite its potential to improve diagnostic access.
Recent disease outbreaks in Africa have underscored the urgent need to strengthen diagnostic capacity and introduce cost-effective technologies.
Small sample sizes and differing disease prioritisation within each country limited the analysis.
These findings suggest the benefits of evaluating laboratory testing capacity for epidemic-prone diseases and highlight the importance of effectively addressing challenges to detect diseases and prevent future pandemics.
Effects of prenatal small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements on pregnancy, birth and infant outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomized controlled trials in low- and middle-income countries  BackgroundUndernutrition during pregnancy increases the risk of giving birth to a small vulnerable newborn.
Small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) contain both macro- and micronutrients and can help prevent nutritional deficiencies during pregnancy and lactation.
ObjectivesWe examined effects of SQ-LNS provided to pregnant women, compared to a) iron and folic acid or standard of care (IFA/SOC) or b) multiple micronutrient supplements (MMS), and identified characteristics that modified effects of SQ-LNS on birth outcomes.
MethodsWe conducted a 2-stage meta-analysis of individual participant data from 4 randomized controlled trials of SQ-LNS provided to pregnant women (n = 5,273).
We generated study-specific and subgroup estimates of SQ-LNS compared with IFA/SOC or MMS and pooled the estimates.
ResultsSQ-LNS (vs IFA/SOC) increased birth weight (mean difference: +49g; 95% CI: 26, 71g), duration of gestation (+0.12 wk; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.24 wk), and all birth anthropometric z-scores (+0.10-0.13 SD); it reduced risk of low birthweight by 11%, newborn stunting by 17%, newborn wasting by 11%, and small head size by 11%.
Only 2 trials compared SQ-LNS and MMS; birth outcomes did not differ except for a marginal increase in head circumference for gestational age (+0.11; 95% CI: -0.01, 0.23).
Effect estimates for SQ-LNS vs IFA/SOC were greater among female infants and among women with body mass index < 20 kg/m2, inflammation, malaria, or household food insecurity.
Effect estimates for SQ-LNS vs MMS were greater among female infants, first-born infants, and women < 25 y.  ConclusionsSQ-LNS had positive impacts on multiple outcomes compared to IFA/SOC, but further research directly comparing SQ-LNS and MMS is needed.
Targeting SQ-LNS to vulnerable subgroups may be worth considering.

Using a Quality Improvement Approach to improve reporting of malaria deaths in Namutumba District, Eastern Uganda, 2022-2023  BackgroundReporting malaria deaths is critical for assessing prevention and case management interventions.
In Uganda, malaria mortality is recorded in inpatient registers and reported through weekly and monthly surveillance reports.
During a data quality assessment in Namutumba District in October 2022, we found more malaria deaths in health facility registers than were reported.
We conducted a continuous quality improvement initiative to improve the accuracy of reported malaria deaths in Namutumba District.
MethodsWe purposively selected 2 high-level health centers (HC) in Namutumba District that reported malaria deaths during September 2021-October 2022.
We formed quality improvement teams (QIT) comprising clinical and statistical staff at the HC.
We held focus group discussions with QITs to identify challenges with reporting malaria deaths, prioritized areas for improvement, and conducted root cause analysis.
InterventionsChallenges included knowledge gaps on malaria death definitions, lack of consequences for failing to document deaths, and unclear guidance on how to document deaths.
Sustainable interventions identified included continuous medical education on malaria death definition, one-on-one mentorship of staff on documentation in inpatient registers, and weekly verification of inpatient register data, all implemented during November 2022-February 2023.
ResultsOf the 36 malaria deaths that occurred during the baseline period (September 2021- October 2022), 25 (69%) were included in the weekly report, and four (11%) in the monthly report.
Following the intervention implementation, all 7 malaria deaths recorded at the 2 health facilities during November 2022-February 2023 were reported in the weekly and monthly reports.
ConclusionContinuous medical education, supervision and mentoring of HC staff, and clear and comprehensive guidance on documenting malaria deaths could facilitate improved malaria death reporting from HC in Uganda, enabling more accurate resource allocation for malaria control.
The anthropogenic fingerprint on emerging infectious diseases  Emerging infectious diseases are increasingly understood as a hallmark of the Anthropocene1-3.
Most experts agree that anthropogenic ecosystem change and high-risk contact among people, livestock, and wildlife have contributed to the recent emergence of new zoonotic, vector-borne, and environmentally-transmitted pathogens1,4-6.
Here, we consolidate 58,319 unique records of outbreak events for 32 emerging infectious diseases worldwide, and systematically test the influence of 16 hypothesized social and environmental drivers on the geography of outbreak risk, while adjusting for multiple detection, reporting, and research biases.
Across diseases, outbreak risks are widely associated with mosaic landscapes where people live alongside forests and fragmented ecosystems, and are commonly exacerbated by long-term decreases in precipitation.
The combined effects of these drivers are particularly strong for vector-borne diseases (e.g., Lyme disease and dengue fever), underscoring that policy strategies to manage these emerging risks will need to address land use and climate change10-12.
In contrast, we find little evidence that spillovers of directly-transmitted zoonotic diseases (e.g., Ebola virus disease and mpox) are consistently associated with these factors, or with other anthropogenic drivers such as deforestation and agricultural intensification13.
Most importantly, we find that observed spatial outbreak intensity is primarily an artefact of the geography of healthcare access, indicating that existing disease surveillance systems remain insufficient for comprehensive monitoring and response: across diseases, outbreak reporting declined by a median of 32% (range 1.2%-96.7%) for each additional hours travel time from the nearest health facility.
Our findings underscore that disease emergence is a multicausal feature of social-ecological systems, and that no one-size-fits-all global strategy can prevent epidemics and pandemics.
Instead, ecosystem-based interventions should follow regional priorities and system-specific evidence, and be paired with investment in One Health surveillance and health system strengthening.
The selective pressure induced by malaria vaccines on Plasmodium falciparum  Antigens of Plasmodium falciparum targeted by most current and future vaccines are generally not conserved.
There are limited studies estimating the risk of parasite selection with vaccines.
We adapted an individual-based model of malaria to assess which conditions favour genotypes having some degree of vaccine resistance and estimate the impact of resistance spread on vaccine effectiveness.
Even parasite genotypes with low degrees of vaccine resistance are likely to spread relatively quickly if vaccines are implemented in children and even faster in a broader population.
However, only highly resistant genotypes could strongly reduce vaccine effectiveness.
If some genotypes exhibit reduced efficacy to vaccines, our results further suggest that polyvalent or combination vaccines should be considered to limit resistance spread.
A multilevel modeling of factors on Sulfadoine-Pyrimethanie uptake in Cameroon: Evidence from national cross-sectional survey  IntroductionPregnant women worldwide face significant risks from malaria, which can adversely affect both mother and baby.
To combat malaria in Cameroon, the WHO, in 2004, recommended a strategy including intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp) using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), and proper management for clinical malaria and anaemia.
This study explores the prevalence and predictors of IPTp-SP uptake across individual, community, and regional levels in Cameroon.
Material and MethodWe utilized data from the 2018 Cameroon Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS) to analyze IPTp-SP uptake employing three-level multi-level models to capture individual, community, and regional influences.
Responses from 4,823 women were analyzed, with results presented in 95% credible intervals.
ResultsWomen aged 35-39 were more likely to receive at least 3 doses of IPTp-SP during their last pregnancies compared to those aged 45-49 (aOR=1.92, 95% Crl=1.08-3.41).
Women without formal education were less likely to have optimal IPTp-SP uptake (aOR=0.81, 95% Crl=0.70-0.92) compared to those with higher education.
The wealthiest women and those attending at least eight ANC visits had higher odds of optimal IPTp-SP uptake (aOR=1.47, 95% Crl=1.20-2.09 and aOR=1.97, 95% Crl=1.25-3.12, respectively).
Additionally, those with health insurance, urban residents, and moderately disadvantaged communities showed increased uptake (aOR=1.70, 95% Crl=1.46-1.94, aOR=2.15, 95% Crl=1.89-3.08, and aOR=1.84, 95% Crl=1.63-2.13, respectively).
ConclusionsCommunity-level factors such as urban residence, female-headed households, and residence in the least disadvantaged communities were also linked to higher IPTp-SP uptake.
Optimal uptake of IPTp-SP was more evident in the least disadvantaged regions.
The findings of this study should guide the Cameroonian Ministry of Health and other stakeholders in developing targeted interventions to enhance the uptake of IPTp-SP in Cameroon.
Impact of long-lasting insecticidal nets on Plasmodium falciparum infection among women attending antenatal clinic at the Bonassama District Hospital, Littoral Region of Cameroon  Malaria during pregnancy continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for both infants and mothers, particularly in sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, despite increased efforts to control it.
The utilization of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) during pregnancy is a well-established strategy to reduce the prevalence of malaria.
Nonetheless, inadequate adherence remains a persistent challenge in certain regions with high malaria endemicity.
This research aimed to assess the effectiveness of long-lasting insecticidal nets in preventing asymptomatic malaria infections among pregnant women attending antenatal care at the Bonassama District Hospital in the Littoral Region of Cameroon.
A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March to June 2022.
Data on sociodemographic characteristics and LLIN usage were collected through a structured questionnaire, while asymptomatic malaria infections were identified using a PfHRP2/pLDH malaria qualitative rapid diagnostic kit.
The relationship between categorical variables was analyzed using the chi-square test and logistic regression at a significance level of 5%.
Out of the 411 pregnant women included in the study, 156 (35.4%) were diagnosed with malaria.
The LLIN utilization rate was 65.1% (287).
The risk of malaria infection was 2.7 times higher (AOR = 2.75, 95% CI = 1.83-4.14, p < 0.001) among women who did not consistently use LLINs compared to those who did.
The majority (65.1%) of pregnant women always used LLINs, while 34.9% did not consistently use them.
Pregnant women aged 20-29 were 3.5 times more likely to use LLINs (AOR = 3.53, 95% CI = 1.61-7.75, p = 0.002) compared to those in the 30-39 and >39 age groups.
Furthermore, women practicing Christianity were 1.7 times more likely (AOR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.01-2.96, p = 0.047) to consistently use LLINs than those of the Islamic faith.
Pregnant women in their first trimester (AOR = 3.40, 95% CI = 1.24-4.64, p = 0.010) and second trimester (AOR = 1.90, 95%CI = 0.99 -3.62, p = 0.055) were more likely to sleep under net when compared to those in the third trimester.
Among the reasons reported by participants for not frequently using LLINs were heat [55.2% (85)], suffocation [13.6% (21)] and the smell of nets [8.4% (13)].
The use of LLIN was moderately high among the participants in this study, though still below national target.
Age group, occupation, religion and gestation period were the major factors determining the use of LLINs.
Considering the proven effectiveness of LLINs in reducing malaria morbidity and mortality, it is imperative for the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) to remain focused in promoting both LLIN ownership and utilization to achieve the national target of 100% and 80%, respectively.
Stable Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein-1 allelic diversity despite decreasing parasitemia in children with multiple malaria infections  Individuals experiencing recurrent malaria infections encounter a variety of alleles with each new infection.
To investigate the diversity and infection variability, Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 (Pfmsp1), a crucial protein for parasite invasion and immune response, was assessed in parasites isolated from children with repeated malaria episodes.
A total of eleven microhaplotypes were observed across all malaria episodes.
There were 4 prevalent microhaplotypes, E-KSNG-L, Q-KSNG-L, Q-KSNG-F, and Q-KNNG-L, in the population.
Conversely, microhaplotypes such as E-KSSR-L, E-KNNG-L, E-KSSG-L, E-TSSR-L (3D7), Q-TSSR-L, E-TSSG-L, and E-KSNG-F were rare and maintained at low frequencies.
High allelic replacements were observed, however some individuals experienced consecutive re-infections with the same microhaplotype.
Notably, Pfmsp119 allelic diversity as measured by haplotype diversity was stable, while nucleotide diversity decreased over time with decreasing parasitemia.
Parasite Pfmsp119 allelic diversity remained stable over the multiple malaria episodes, despite declining parasitaemia levels and ongoing immune development.
In addition, our findings reveal dynamic Pfmsp119 allelic replacements across parasite infection episodes, with initial immune responses to prevalent variants potentially waning over time, allowing for re-infections.
Overall, our findings emphasize that protective immunity to malaria involves complex immune responses targeting multiple alleles that wane over time and thus the development of sterilizing immunity is a challenge.
Societal Uses of the Main Water Bodies Inhabited by Malaria Vectors and Implications for Larval Source Management  IntroductionLarval source management (LSM) can effectively suppress mosquito populations at source and provides an opportunity to address major challenges such as insecticide resistance that undermine primary interventions like insecticide-treated nets (ITNs).
While mostly implemented in urban and arid settings, emerging research indicates its potential in some rural settings in east and southern Africa, where the main malaria vector, Anopheles funestus, prefers permanent and semi-permanent water bodies that support year-round transmission.
Targeting these unique habitats could amplify effectiveness of LSM but requires careful considerations of local societal practices and expectations - particularly since mosquito breeding sites often also serve as community water resources.
The aim of this study was therefore to explore how the societal uses of aquatic habitats by local communities in rural south-eastern Tanzania might influence LSM strategies, focusing on habitats frequented by An.
MethodsThis study was conducted in three villages in the Ulanga and Malinyi districts of southeastern Tanzania using a mixed-methods approach.
Quantitative data were collected through a cross-sectional surveillance of all aquatic habitats, while qualitative data were gathered via a combination of individual unstructured interviews, focus group discussions with various community groups and field observations of community practices and activities.
Data analysis employed weaving and inferencing techniques to integrate findings from both quantitative and qualitative components, thereby developing a comprehensive understanding from the respondents perspectives.
ResultsA survey of 931 aquatic habitats revealed that 73% contained mosquito larvae, with late instar An.
funestus identified in 23% of these habitats.
River streams segments were the most common habitat type, accounting for 41%, followed by ground pools at 4%; other types included pits, rice fields, ditches, and puddles.
Community use was noted for 90% of these habitats, including 95% of those with An.
funestus larvae, for activities such as domestic chores such as cooking, washing utensils, washing clothes and bathing, agriculture, livestock rearing, brickmaking, and fishing.
Community concerns regarding LSM centered on the safety of larvicides for animal and human health and their environmental impact.
The discussions proved the need for LSM interventions to integrate seamlessly with daily activities; and for community education on LSM safety and efficacy.
ConclusionThis study offers valuable insights into community perspectives on LSM for malaria control in rural settings, emphasizing the dual role of aquatic habitats as both mosquito breeding sites and community water sources.
This presents a set of unique challenges and opportunities - suggesting that LSM strategies must address both the biological aspects of mosquito control and the socio-economic realities of local communities.
Notably, there was a marked preference for larviciding and habitat manipulation over habitat removal, with a strong emphasis on health and environmental safety.
Overall, the study highlights the critical importance of educating communities, adopting culturally sensitive approaches to LSM, and aligning LSM strategies with the needs, perspectives, and daily lives of local communities.
Real-world effectiveness of Deltamethrin-Clothianidin (FLUDORA FUSION) in Indoor Residual Spraying in sub-Saharan Africa: A Systematic Review Protocol  BackgroundIndoor residual spraying (IRS) is a core insecticide-based vector control tool employed in most malaria-affected settings globally.
This has necessitated a transition to new classes of insecticides from mostly using Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and pyrethroids from 1997 to 2010, to carbamates from 2011 and organophosphates from 2013.
In addition, other vector control measures like the use of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets (LLINs) have also been employed for malaria control.
Despite the implementation of these mosquito vector control interventions, malaria remains a disease of public health concern especially in sub-Saharan Africa which bears over 90% of the disease burden.
This review will thus collate evidence on the effectiveness of IRS for malaria control in sub-Saharan Africa.
Methods and analysisThe systematic review will be done following a priori criteria developed using PRISMA guidelines.
Additionally, websites of malaria research institutions will be searched.
Article search will be done by two independent librarians (AAK and RS).
All identified articles will be transferred to Epi-reviewer v6.15.1.0 software.
Article screening and data abstraction will be done in duplicate by four reviewers (KO, LN, GK and MO) and any further disagreements will be resolved through discussion and consensus.
Data analysis will be done using STATA v17.0.
Heterogeneity in the articles will be assessed using the I2 statistic.
ResultsThe findings of this review will help generate evidence on the effectiveness of indoor residual spraying using WHO pre-qualified insecticides in malaria control in sub-Saharan Africa.

Factors Affecting Integration of an Early Warning System for Antimalarial Drug Resistance within a Routine Surveillance System in a Pre-elimination Setting in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Integrating molecular resistance marker surveillance into routine malaria surveillance in pre-elimination contexts offers a potential early warning mechanism to identify resistance signals and target areas for further investigation, including therapeutic efficacy studies.
From March 2018 to February 2020, a sequential mixed-methods study was conducted in primary healthcare facilities in a South African pre-elimination setting to explore factors influencing the flow, quality and linkage of malaria case notification and antimalarial molecular resistance marker data.
Using a process-oriented framework, we undertook monthly and quarterly data linkage and consistency analysis at different levels of the health system, as well as a survey, focus group discussions and interviews to identify potential barriers to, and enhancers of, the roll-out and uptake of this integrated information system.
Over two years, 4,787 confirmed malaria cases were notified from 42 primary healthcare facilities in the Nkomazi sub-district, Mpumalanga, South Africa.
Of the notified cases, 78.5% (n=3,758) were investigated, and 55.1% (n=2,636) were successfully linked to their Plasmodium falciparum molecular resistance marker profiles.
Five tangible processes--malaria case detection and notification, sample collection, case investigation, analysis and reporting--were identified within the process-oriented logic model.
Approaching malaria elimination, linking molecular markers of antimalarial resistance to routine malaria surveillance is feasible.
Assessing dengue forecasting methods: A comparative study of statistical models and machine learning techniques in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil  BackgroundDengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that poses a significant public health threat in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide.
Accurate forecasting of dengue outbreaks is crucial for effective public health planning and intervention.
This study aims to assess the predictive performance and computational efficiency of a number of statistical models and machine learning techniques for dengue forecasting, both with and without the inclusion of climate factors, to inform the design of dengue surveillance systems.
MethodsThe study considers dengue cases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, as well as climate factors known to affect disease transmission.
Employing a dynamic window approach, various statistical methods and machine learning techniques were used to generate weekly forecasts at several time horizons.
Error measures, uncertainty intervals, and computational efficiency obtained with each method were compared.
Statistical models considered were Autoregressive (AR), Moving Average (MA), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Exponential Smoothing State Space Model (ETS).
Additionally, models incorporating temperature and humidity as covariates, such as Vector Autoregression (VAR) and Seasonal ARIMAX (SARIMAX), were employed.
Machine learning techniques evaluated were Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Prophet.
Ensemble approaches that integrated the top performing methods were also considered.
The evaluated methods also incorporated lagged climatic variables to account for delayed effects.
ResultsAmong the statistical models, ARIMA demonstrated the best performance using only historical case data, while SARIMAX significantly improved predictive accuracy by incorporating climate covariates.
In general, the LSTM model, particularly when combined with climate covariates, proved to be the most accurate machine learning model, despite being slower to train and predict.
Ensemble models, such as the combination of LSTM and ARIMA, showed substantial improvements over individual models.
ConclusionThis study demonstrates the strengths and limitations of various methods for dengue forecasting across multiple timeframes.
These findings offer valuable insights for public health officials, facilitating the development of dengue surveillance systems for more accurate forecasting and timely allocation of resources to mitigate dengue outbreaks.

Human and entomological determinants of malaria transmission in the Lihir Islands of Papua New Guinea: a cross-sectional study.
BackgroundThe Lihir Islands of Papua New Guinea, located in an area with high burden of malaria and hosting a large mining operation, offer a unique opportunity to study transmission.
There, we investigated human and vector factors influencing malaria transmission.
MethodsIn 2019, a cross-sectional study was conducted on 2,914 individuals assessing malaria prevalence through rapid diagnostic tests (RDT), microscopy, and quantitative PCR (qPCR).
A logistic regression analysis identified infection-associated factors.
Anopheles species distribution, biting behaviours, and sporozoite carriage were assessed through human landing catches and larval surveys.
ResultsOverall malaria prevalence (any species) was 3.6% by RDT, 4.5% by microscopy, and 15.0% by qPCR.
P. vivax accounted for 37.1% of infections, P. falciparum for 34.6%, P. malariae for 3.0%, P. ovale 0.2%, and mixed infections for 24.5%.
P. vivax accounted for 37.1% of infections, P. falciparum for 34.6%, P. malariae for 3.0%, P. ovale 0.2%, and mixed infections for 24.5%.
P. vivax accounted for 37.1% of infections, P. falciparum for 34.6%, P. malariae for 3.0%, P. ovale 0.2%, and mixed infections for 24.5%.
P. vivax accounted for 37.1% of infections, P. falciparum for 34.6%, P. malariae for 3.0%, P. ovale 0.2%, and mixed infections for 24.5%.
Prevalence (qPCR) varied across geographic areas, from 8.5% in the mine-impacted zone (MIZ) to 27.0% in the non-MIZ.
Other factors independently associated with infection risk included cohabiting with an infected individual (aOR=1.94, 95%CI: 1.56-2.42), and residing in traditional housing (aOR=1.65, 95%CI: 1.21-2.25).
Children had double the infection risk compared to adults, and the use of long-lasting insecticidal-treated nets did not decrease risk of infection.
punctulatus was the major vector in one of the four geographical areas; while An.
farauti was predominant in the rest of them, both with an early biting behaviour but with different biting intensities by geographical area.
Entomological inoculation rates ranged from 26.9 (95%CI: 12.3-45.2) infective bites per person-year in the MIZ to 441.3 (95%CI: 315.7-572.1) in the non-MIZ.
ConclusionsMalaria transmission and infection was lower in the MIZ compared to other areas, underscoring the potential of the mine company to enhance malaria control in Lihir.
Measures focusing on at-risk groups, including vector-control and transmission interruption methods, could be used to reduce malaria burden, especially outside the MIZ.
AUTHOR SUMMARYThe Lihir Islands of Papua New Guinea host a mining operation on Aniolam, the main island, which implements specific vector control strategies in the mine-impacted zone (MIZ); whereas the remaining areas rely solely on distribution of long-lasting insecticidal-treated nets (LLIN).
Our study compared transmission dynamics in the different geographic areas and demonstrated lower malaria incidence, prevalence, Anopheles density and biting intensities in the MIZ.
Living outside the MIZ on Aniolam and on Malie Island was associated with a higher risk of infection, with transmission metrics rarely seen outside high burden countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
Besides the geographic area, other risk factors for infection included younger age, cohabiting with infected individuals, and living in traditional housing; while the use of LLINs was not associated with a reduction of infection risk.
Our results highlight the need for tailored strategies based on local transmission patterns and could be beneficial for ongoing initiatives aimed at malaria control and elimination.
Such a public-private partnership could enhance control efforts, including expansion of diagnostics and treatments, the vector control program and community education beyond the MIZ.
Stress-mediating Inflammatory Cytokine Profiling Reveals Unique Patterns in Malaria and Typhoid Fever Patients  BackgroundMalaria and typhoid fever are known to cause severe morbidity and mortality if miss-treated or left untreated.
The oxidant/antioxidant and immune responses to these diseases involve a complex interplay of stress-mediating inflammatory cytokines which orchestrate a coherent response that leads to pathogen clearance and recovery.
This study investigated the stress-mediated cytokine profiles in patients attending the Obala District Hospital, Yaounde, Cameroon and diagnosed with malaria and/or typhoid fever.
MethodsIn this cross-sectional observational study, we measured the levels of cortisol and stress-mediating inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood samples collected from 55 malaria and/or typhoid fever patients, along with a healthy control group (n = 15) using commercial ELISA kits.
The psychological stress of the voluntary participants over the past 30 days was assessed using a 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) questionnaire.
ResultsCompared to the control group, patients with co-infection showed significant differences in anemia, thrombocytopenia, and monocytosis.
Psychological stress levels were insignificantly higher in patients with typhoid fever (18.20{+/-}5.5) compared to control (15.0{+/-}2.43), malaria (15.80{+/-}4.39), and comorbidity (15.40{+/-}5.26) groups.
Cortisol levels were significantly (p<0.001) higher in all patient groups compared to the control group, with the typho-malaria group showing a 2.5-fold increase.
Cytokine levels were also elevated in patients with malaria and typhoid comorbidity, particularly IL-1{beta}, IL-2, TNF-, and IFN-{gamma}.
While IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher in patients with malaria and typho-malaria comorbidity, IL-10 levels were reduced in the typho-malaria group but still higher than in the control group.
The TNF-/IL-10 ratio was significantly higher in the co-infected group, indicating a more intense inflammatory response.
Interestingly, there was a positive correlation between perceived stress scores and IL-2 (r = 0.365, p=0.002), IFN-{gamma} (r = 0.248, p=0.03) and IL-6 (r = 0.412, p=0.0001) in the typho-malaria group.
Beside IL-6, no significant correlation was found between stress index and the other anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 (r = 0.204, p=0.09) and IL-10 (r = 0.153, p=0.20) in coinfected individuals.
ConclusionThese results suggest that stress response may play a crucial role in shaping the inflammatory landscape during malaria and typhoid fever.
Exposed to severe stressors may disrupt immune response and contribute to negative health outcomes.
Understanding the immunopathogenesis of these diseases could potentially pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the stress-cytokine axis.
Diagnosis of the Beninese Health System: Progress and Challenges for an Effective, Resilient and Sustainable System  This work involved diagnosing the Beninese health system based on secondary data from several sources (statistical directories, surveys, censuses, and study reports).
The descriptive analysis of the evolution of health indicators in Benin between 2002 and 2021 and in-depth interviews with resource people in the health sector made it possible to assess the efforts and progress made by those in power and system stakeholders.
There have been many tangible efforts to improve accessibility to health services (the rates of health coverage and attendance at health facilities have increased from 86% to 96% and from 35% to 56% between 2002 and 2021).
The results also indicate a drop in deaths due to malaria (141 deaths to 86 per 100,000 inhabitants between 2003 and 2021) and a drop in the prevalence of HIV AIDS up to 0.8% from 2019 ahead of several countries--neighbors of the sub-region.
Early neonatal mortality fell from 10.1{per thousand} to 4.7{per thousand} as well as deaths of children under 5 years old, thus improving life expectancy at birth from 59.6 years in 2002 to 63.8 years in 2013.
Economic evaluation of Wolbachia deployment in Colombia: A modeling study  Background and AimsWolbachia are bacteria that inhibit dengue virus replication within the mosquito.
A cluster-randomized trial found Wolbachia reduced virologically-confirmed dengue cases by 77% and previous models predicted Wolbachia to be highly cost-effective in Indonesia, Vietnam, and Brazil.
in Colombia, Wolbachia was introduced in the Aburra Valley in 2015 and Cali in 2020.
MethodsWe assembled quantities and the distribution by severity of reported dengue cases from Colombias national disease surveillance system and the health service provision registry (RIPS).
An epidemiological panel of three experts estimated the shares of non-medical cases and adjustments for under-reporting and misclassifications.
We determined costs (in 2020 US dollars) of treating dengue illness from the benchmark insurance tariff, RIPS data on treatment services per symptomatic dengue case, and the national government database for establishing insurance premiums.
A cluster randomized trial quantified the effectiveness of Wolbachia against symptomatic dengue cases.
ResultsProjecting impact over 10 years for Cali, we estimated a net health-sector savings of USD4.95 per person.
We also estimated averting 369 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per 100,000 population.
From a societal perspective, at 10 years Wolbachia deployment is expected to have highly favorable  ConclusionsOver 10 years, Wolbachia is highly beneficial on economic grounds, and almost universally cost saving.
That is, Wolbachias savings in health care costs alone would more than offset deployment costs nationally and in 9 target cities (those with adjusted annual dengue incidence at least 50/100,000 population).
Perceptions of Water Security and Climate Change in Lima, Peru: Qualitative Study of Mothers and Healthcare Providers  BackgroundWater insecurity, a global public health crisis, will be intensified by climate change.
Understanding first-hand experiences and perceptions of mothers and healthcare providers can inform strategies to mitigate the effects of water insecurity and climate change on health outcomes and health disparities.
MethodsThis qualitative study took place in 2023 in Carabayllo, the Northernmost region of Lima, Peru comprised of urban and rural communities.
We conducted six focus groups with 10 pregnant women and 23 mothers of children ages 0 to 10, as well as individual interviews with 22 healthcare providers.
Data were analyzed through rapid qualitative analysis combining deductive and inductive methods.
Principal findingsWater insecurity was common among community members and was normalized as part of daily life.
Access to water varied based on socioeconomic status and geography.
diarrheal disease), water storage (dengue), and longer-term effects such as nutrition and child development.
Conclusions and significanceThe lived experiences of water insecurity and its health impacts in Lima, Peru highlight the importance of mobilizing community stakeholders, health systems and local government to increase water security and support healthcare facilities and communities on water conservation and climate preparedness efforts.
2023-24 dengue outbreak in Valle del Cauca, Colombia caused by multiple virus serotypes and lineages  Global dengue cases rapidly rose to record levels in 2023-24.
We investigated this trend in Valle del Cauca, Colombia to determine if specific dengue virus serotypes or lineages were responsible for the large outbreak.
We detected all four serotypes and multiple lineages, suggesting that other factors, such as climatic conditions, are likely responsible.
Estimating the impact of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine in Benin: A mathematical modelling study  BackgroundMalaria constitutes a major public health burden in sub-Saharan Africa.
It remains a key health concern and the leading cause of death in children under five years of age in Benin.
Since October 2021, the World Health Organization has recommended the use of malaria vaccines for the prevention of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children living in malaria endemic areas, prioritizing areas of moderate and high transmission in sub-Saharan Africa.
However, with the exception of Ghana, there is a scarcity of studies modelling the potential impact of the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine in the context of West Africa.
This study addresses a gap in research by modelling the impact of malaria childhood vaccination on Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission in Benin.
MethodsA compartmental mathematical model has been developed to estimate clinical and severe malaria cases averted in children under the age of five with the primary series (3 doses) of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine in Benin.
Over a period of 10 years, scenarios including vaccine introduction at different coverage levels to supplement the use of long-lasting insecticidal nets to assess the impact of the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine on malaria transmission in Benin are modelled.
ResultsThe model projected malaria burden alleviation by malaria vaccination in Benin.
The combination of childhood malaria vaccination at a coverage equivalent to the national DTP3 coverage and the current use of long-lasting insecticidal nets is projected to result in 40% reduction in malaria clinical cases and deaths among children under five years old compared to using nets alone, from 2025 to 2034.
However, if the introduction of a malaria vaccine has the unintended consequence of decreased net use, cumulative benefits may be offset.
A 1.5-fold decrease in the use of long-lasting insecticidal nets is projected to result in an increase in malaria burden, surpassing baseline levels despite the introduction of the vaccine.
ConclusionThis modelling exercise concludes that childhood vaccination is expected to avert clinical and severe cases of malaria and is an additional tool to advance malaria control efforts in Benin but potential unintended consequences of a reduction in net usage may reduce these gains.
Comparing different approaches of modelling the effects of temperature and rainfall on malaria transmission in high and low transmission settings  BackgroundMalaria transmission is primarily limited to tropical regions where environmental conditions are conducive for the survival of Plasmodium parasites and Anopheles mosquitoes.
Adequate rainfall provides breeding sites, while suitable temperatures facilitate vector mosquito life-cycles and parasite development.
Evaluating the efficacy of vector control interventions is crucial to determine their effectiveness in reducing malaria transmission.
MethodsWe developed a vector-host compartmental mathematical model to compare three published approaches to incorporating weather influences on malaria transmission.
The first approach examines mosquito biting behaviour and mortality rates in larval and adult stages.
The second focuses on temperature effects on mosquito life-cycle characteristics throughout the aquatic and adult stages.
Model simulations were conducted at different annual vector control coverage levels, to identify variations in transmission patterns and seasonal variability in daily and annual incidence across three climate regions.
ResultsThe first approach indicates sustained seasonal transmission, with lower cases per 1,000 in tropical regions compared to semi-arid and sub-tropical regions, even with enhanced vector control reducing cases.
The second approach predicts sharp, brief annual peaks, with zero transmission during winter in tropical and semi-arid regions, while sub-tropical regions experience ongoing transmission.
In contrast, the third approach projects multiple irregular peaks, with transmission ceasing in winter across all regions.
ConclusionsSimulations indicate that climatic events like heatwaves or flooding, can trigger mosquito population surges and malaria outbreaks, even in areas previously free of malaria, despite strong vector control efforts.
However, the results demonstrate that sustained and effective vector control, particularly in regions with moderate temperatures, can substantially reduce malaria incidence.
Effective malaria control requires incorporating weather predictions into intervention plans, and enhancing current vector control strategies with supplementary measures like larval source management.

Determinants of Timely Malaria Treatment among Under-Five Children Attending Public Health Facilities in Kisumu East Sub-County, Kenya: A Health Facility-Based Cross-Sectional Study  Evidence shows that most child malaria deaths occur at home shortly after symptom onset, highlighting the need for timely treatment.
This study aimed to assess the determinants of timely malaria treatment among under-five children who receive care at public health facilities in Kisumu East sub-county, Kenya.
A health facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Kisumu East sub-county, Kenya, between 5th April and 26th May 2023.
The study employed a two-stage stratified-cluster sampling method, first selecting hospitals and then using systematic sampling to select caregivers.
Data collection was done electronically using structured questionnaires.
Associations at bivariable level were assessed using either the Chi-square or Fishers exact test based on assumptions.
Multiple logistic regression with robust standard errors was applied at a 5% significance level to establish determinants of timely malaria treatment among under-five children.
STATA version 16 (College Station, Texas 77845 USA) was used for all analyses.
The sample included a total of 434 caregivers of under-five children.
The study revealed that caregivers ability to recognize malaria symptoms was associated with higher odds of seeking timely malaria treatment for their children (AOR=2.92; 95% CI=1.36-6.25; p=0.006).
Additionally, having health insurance cover was associated with higher odds of timely treatment (AOR=2.12; 95% CI=1.25-3.59; p=0.005).
Those who visited herbalists before seeking care were less likely to seek timely treatment (AOR=0.13; 95% CI=0.05-0.34; p<0.0001).
Fear of drugs side effects reduced the odds of timely treatment (AOR=0.50; 95% CI=0.29-0.87; p=0.013).
Timely malaria treatment was linked to the ability to tell symptoms and having health insurance, while delayed malaria treatment was related to herbalist visits and fear of malaria, among others.
There is need for relevant stakeholders to implement strategies that address misconceptions about drug side effects, offer affordable insurance, integrate the informal health sector, and educate caregivers about under-five malaria symptoms in order to promote timely malaria treatment.
Spatio-Temporal Dynamics and Climate Change Scenarios Forecast of Dengue Incidence in Brazil  Dengue is a neglected tropical vector-borne disease that is spreading rapidly and increasing worldwide.
Climate change has been considered one of the primary factors contributing to this escalation.
In this study, we used predictive modeling techniques, grounded on a Bayesian hierarchical framework, to forecast the spatio-temporal dynamics of dengue in Brazil under future climate scenarios.
We used monthly historical data on dengue incidence from 2000 to 2021, collected over 557 Brazilian microregions, to learn about its association with population, environmental, climatic, and socioeconomic conditions.
By integrating projections of precipitation, minimum temperature and population based on different Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios, we obtained spatially resolved projections of dengue incidence for 2021-2040 and 2041-2060.
We observed an increase in dengue incidence with rising precipitation, urban infrastructure, and Normalized Difference Water Index, and a decrease with increas-ing elevation and deprivation index.
Minimum temperature exhibited a nonlinear and positive association behavior.
In the south region, some traditionally non-endemic microregions are expected to see a clear increase in dengue incidence rate.
Conversely, other regions show geographic variability of patterns, suggesting that in some cases elevated temperatures may exceed the viable threshold for dengue transmission.
Investing in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and implementing measures to address the rising incidence of dengue due to climate change is crucial.
Adherence to the 2016 PAHO Clinical Practice Guideline on Dengue in a Hospital in Northern Peru, 2022-2023  BackgroundEffective dengue management enhances the chances of survival.
The level of adherence to the suggestions in northern Peru is uncertain.
The primary aim of the study was to assess adherence to the 2016 PAHO guideline on dengue in a hospital located in northern Peru during the period from 2022 to 2023.
Methodology/principal findingsThe study performed a cross-sectional design and exploratory analysis, reviewing 141 medical records.
Fifty-four percent were from 2023; 65.9% were from women; 46.1% came from another healthcare center; 76.6% had diagnosis of dengue with warning signs; 20.7% had severe dengue; and 18.44% died.
We found at least one error in the classification of severity and/or treatment in non-hospital healthcare facilities (91.5%), triage (88.5%), and uviclin/observation (52.6%).
Errors in classification and inadequate hydration in the non-hospital healthcare centers, triage, and uviclin/observation were: 35.8%/53.7%, 30.6%/76.6%, and 10.1%/45.6%, respectively.
Persistent errors were inadequate hydration in triage (76.86%) and urinary flow in the center (73.13%).
In a bivariate analysis, mortality was associated with older age (p = 0.035), having a case from 2023 (p = 0.0073), having a case from the study hospital (p = 0.083), and having severe dengue (p<0.001).
In the multivariate analysis, only severe dengue (OR 318.4, 95% IC [33.8-2996], p<0.001) was associated with mortality.
Conclusions/significanceWe found a high frequency of misclassification and management errors in these three scenarios, but they were not associated with higher mortality.
Author summaryAccording to the PAHO 2016 Dengue Guidelines, this descriptive study found deficiencies in the diagnosis of severity and treatment in a public hospital of the Ministry of Health of Peru, located in the region with the highest dengue incidence rate in 2023.
We identified these deficiencies in the pre-hospital phase, as well as in the emergency, observation, and dengue management units, which had a high mortality rate of 18%.
While it is true that management errors were not associated with higher mortality in the exploratory analysis, study biases may explain this result.
We must take these findings into account when investigating the effectiveness of the health worker training that took place between 2023 and 2024, employing a master-class methodology and awaiting a before and after analysis to gauge its impact on knowledge.
The need for improvements in health data management highlights the need to digitize information and electronic health records.
Quantifying infectious disease epidemic risks: A practical approach for seasonal pathogens  For many infectious diseases, the risk of outbreaks varies seasonally.
If a pathogen is usually absent from a host population, a key public health policy question is whether the pathogens arrival will initiate local transmission, which depends on the season in which arrival occurs.
A standard approach for inferring this probability exists for seasonal pathogens (involving calculating the Case Epidemic Risk; CER) based on the mathematical theory of branching processes.
Under that theory, the probability of pathogen extinction is estimated, neglecting depletion of susceptible individuals.
The CER is then one minus the extinction probability.
However, as we show, if transmission cannot occur for long periods of the year (e.g., over winter or over summer), the pathogen will inevitably go extinct, leading to a CER of zero even if seasonal outbreaks can occur.
This renders the CER uninformative in those scenarios.
We therefore devise an alternative approach for inferring outbreak risks for seasonal pathogens (involving calculating the Threshold Epidemic Risk; TER).
Estimation of the TER involves calculating the probability that introduced cases will initiate a local outbreak in which a threshold number of infections is exceeded before outbreak extinction.
For simple seasonal epidemic models, such as the stochastic Susceptible-Infectious-Removed model, the TER can be calculated numerically (without model simulations).
For more complex models, such as stochastic host-vector models, the TER can be estimated using model simulations.
We demonstrate the application of our approach by considering Chikungunya virus in northern Italy as a case study.
In that context, transmission is most likely in summer, when environmental conditions promote vector abundance.
Author SummaryInvasive pathogens pose a challenge to human health, particularly as outbreak risks for some infectious diseases are being exacerbated by climate change.
For example, the occurrence of seasonal vector-borne disease outbreaks in mainland Europe is increasing, even though pathogens like the Chikungunya and dengue viruses are not normally present there.
In this changing landscape, assessing the risk posed by invasive pathogens requires computational methods for estimating the probability that introduced cases will lead to a local outbreak, as opposed to the first few cases fading out without causing a local outbreak.
In this article, we therefore provide a computational framework for estimating the risk that introduced cases will lead to a local outbreak in which a pre-specified, context specific threshold number of cases is exceeded (we term this risk the "Threshold Epidemic Risk", or TER).
Since even small seasonal outbreaks can have negative impacts on local populations, we demonstrate that calculation of the TER provides more appropriate estimates of local outbreak risks than those inferred using standard methods.
Public health impact of current and proposed age-expanded perennial malaria chemoprevention: a modelling study  In 2022, the World Health Organization extended their guidelines for perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC) from infants to children up to 24 months old.
However, evidence for PMCs public health impact is primarily limited to children under 15 months.
We integrated an individual-based model of malaria with pharmacological models of drug action to address these questions for PMC and a proposed age-expanded schedule (PMC+, for children 03-36 months).
Across prevalence settings of 5-70% and different drug sensitivity assumptions, we predicted PMC and PMC+s median efficacy of 18.6%(12.2-25.0%) and 21.9%(14.3-29.5%) against clinical disease and 9.0%(2.0-16.0%) and 10.8%(3.2-18.4%) against severe malaria, respectively, in children under three years.
PMCs total impact outweighed risk of delayed malaria in children up to age five and remained cost-effective when delivered through the Expanded Program on Immunization.
Effectiveness and efficacy of long-lasting insecticidal nets for malaria control in Africa: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials  BackgroundMalaria, a parasitic disease that is transmitted by the bite of a female Anopheles mosquito, can also be contracted through exposure to infected blood products or congenitally.
Long-lasting insecticidal nets have significantly reduced the malaria burden in the past decade and this malaria prevalence reduction has been achieved through the upgrading of pyrethroid long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), but the reduction has stopped due to pyrethroid fast resistance.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends new LLINs with two active ingredients for areas with malaria vectors resistant to pyrethroids.
Malaria control in Africa faces threat from pyrethroid resistance, prompting the development of new long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) with dual active ingredients to interrupt transmission in pyrethroid-resistant areas.
A study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and efficacy of different mixtures of active-ingredient LLINs compared to standard pyrethroid LLINs against pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors showed no reduction in the density of Mansonia spp.
in the pyrethroid pyriproxyfen LLIN arm outdoors.
Therefore, the objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to pool estimates of the effectiveness and efficacy of pyriproxyfen, chlorfenapyr, and piperonyl butoxide long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) with pyrethroid-only LLINs for malaria control in African.
This study also evaluated the effectiveness and efficacy of chlorfenapyr, and piperonyl butoxide long-lasting insecticidal nets compared to pyriproxyfen LLINs.
MethodThe protocol was registered in PROSPERO with the protocol number: CRD42024499800.
It included cluster randomized or prospective clinical trials comparing long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) of Pyriproxyfen, Chlorfenapyr, and/or Piperonyl Butoxide for malaria control (test arm) and pyrethroid-only standard LLINs (control arm) for malaria control.
Three reviewers independently read each preprint or publication and extracted relevant data from individual studies.
The search was conducted from 2000 to 2024, and meta-analysis was performed using Excel and STATA 17.
The extracted data from eligible studies were pooled using the random effects model and expressed as a risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI).
ResultA total of 11 cluster randomized controlled trials with 21,916 households, 1,145,035 people, and 34,327 children across all of the studies reporting sample size.
This study found that the pooled prevalence of post-intervention malaria infection among children using chlorfenapyr, piperonyl butoxide, and pyriproxyfen long-lasting insecticidal nets was 25.58 per 100 children, 32.38 per 100 children, and 33.70 per 100 children, respectively, compared to the control group/pyrethroid-only long-lasting insecticidal nets of 40.84% per 100 children in Africa, which is higher in the control group.
The study found that the post-intervention pooled mean indoor vector density per household per night in the control group/pyrethroid-only long-lasting insecticidal nets was higher than in the intervention groups, with pyrethroid-only nets having the highest density at 8.04 per household per night, compared to other insecticidal nets (7.74 per 100 households in pyriproxyfen, 5.53 per 100 households in chlorfenapyr, and the lowest 1.9 per 100 households per night in piperonyl butoxide) in Africa.
The study determined that the post-intervention pooled sporozoite rate per mosquito in the control group/pyrethroid-only long-lasting insecticidal nets was almost two to three times higher than in the intervention groups, with pyrethroid-only nets having the highest sporozoite rate per mosquito at 227 per 100 anopheles, compared to other interventional long-lasting insecticidal nets (165 per 100 anopheles in pyriproxyfen, 172 per 100 anopheles in piperonyl butoxide, and the lowest 79 per 100 anopheles in chlorfenapyr) in Africa.
A meta-analysis found that pyriproxyfen (PPF) long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) effectively reduce indoor vector density by 1%, entomological inoculation rate by 7%, and sporozoite rate of malaria parasites by 15% compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs in Africa, despite no significant difference in malaria infection, case incidence, and anemia reduction among children.
The study found that piperonyl butoxide (PBO) long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are highly effective and efficacious in reducing malaria infection by 1%, case incidence by 2%, and anaemia by 3% among children, as well as reducing indoor vector density by 3%, the mean entomological inoculation rate by 12%, and the sporozoite rate by 10% in Africa as compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs in Africa.
The study found that chlorfenapyr (CFP) long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are highly effective and efficacious in reducing malaria infection by 1%, case incidence by 1%, and anaemia by 4% among children, as well as reducing indoor vector density by 4%, the inoculation rate by 23%, and the sporozoite rate by 9% in Africa as compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs in Africa.
The study compared the effectiveness and efficacy of chlorfenapyr (CFP) and pyriproxyfen long-lasting insecticidal nets in Africa.
Results showed that CFP nets were highly effective, and efficacious in reducing malaria infection, case incidence, indoor vector density, inoculation rate, and sporozoite rate by 1%, 15%, and 7%, respectively, compared to pyriproxyfen nets long-lasting insecticidal nets for malaria control in Africa.
The evidence evaluating the effectiveness and efficacy of piperonyl butoxide (PBO) compared with pyriproxyfen long-lasting insecticidal nets found that piperonyl butoxide (PBO) long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are highly effective and efficacious in reducing malaria infection by 0.0%, case incidence by 2% among children, indoor vector density by 4%, inoculation rate by 5%, and sporozoite rate by 1% in piperonyl butoxide (PBO) as compared to pyriproxyfen long-lasting insecticidal nets for malaria control in Africa.
Critical appraisal of individual randomized control trials revealed that 100% of the studies scored high quality, and Cochrane methodology was used to assess the risk of bias and evaluate evidence quality, which was graded as high.
ConclusionThis generated evidence was evaluated the effectiveness and efficacy of pyriproxyfen, chlorfenapyr, and piperonyl butoxide long-lasting insecticidal nets against the pyrethroid-only LLINs.
This study found that PYR-only LLINs (control arm) had higher pooled prevalence of malaria infection, case incidence, anaemia, mean indoor vector density, inoculationrate, and sporozoite rate as compared to intervention group (PPF, CFP, and PBO LLINs  The evidence generated from this meta-analysis reveals that pyriproxyfen (PPF) long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) have no significant difference in malaria infection, case incidence, or anemia reduction among children as compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs.
However, this study found that Pyriproxyfen (PPF) LLINs effectively and efficaciously reduce indoor vector density, entomological inoculationrate, and sporozoite rate of malaria parasites compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs.
The study found that chlorfenapyr (CFP) and piperonyl butoxide (PBO) long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are highly effective and efficacious in reducing malaria infection, case incidence, and anaemia among children, as well as reducing indoor vector density, inoculation rate, and sporozoite rate in Africa as compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs.
The evidence generated found that piperonyl butoxide (PBO) long-lasting insecticidal nets effectively and efficaciously reduce indoor vector density, entomological inoculation rate, and sporozoite rate of malaria parasites compared to Pyriproxyfen (PPF) LLINs, but no significant difference was found in malaria infection reduction among children who use piperonyl butoxide (PBO) versus Pyriproxyfen (PPF) long-lasting insecticidal nets in Africa.
The study found that chlorfenapyr (CFP) long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are highly effective and superiorly efficacious in reducing malaria infection, case incidence, and anemia among children, as well as reducing mean indoor vector density, mean entomological inoculation rate, and sporozoite rate compared to pyriproxyfen (PPF) long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) in Africa.
Therefore, policymakers and health planners should give a great deal of emphasis on addressing the effectiveness, efficacy, and resistance management of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) as part of their current public health agenda to eliminate malaria.
LLIN Evaluation in Uganda Project (LLINEUP2) -- Effect of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) treated with pyrethroid plus pyriproxyfen vs LLINs treated with pyrethroid plus piperonyl butoxide in Uganda: a cluster-randomised trial  BackgroundWe embedded a pragmatic, cluster-randomised trial into Ugandas national campaign to distribute long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) in 2020-2021, comparing LLINs treated with pyrethroids plus the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO), to LLINs treated with pyrethroids plus pyriproxyfen, an insect growth regulator.
MethodsTarget communities surrounding public health facilities (clusters, n=64), covering 32 high-burden districts not receiving indoor residual spraying, were included.
Clusters were randomised 1:1 in blocks of two by district to receive: (1) pyrethroid-PBO LLINs (PermaNet 3.0, n=32) or (2) pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen LLINs (Royal Guard, n=32).
LLINs were delivered from 7 November 2020 to 26 March 2021 and malaria outcome data were collected until 31 March 2023.
Estimates of malaria incidence in residents of all ages (the primary outcome) were generated for each cluster from enhanced health facility surveillance data.
At 12- (24 November 2021 to 1 April 2022) and 24-months (23 November 2022 to 21 March 2023) post-LLIN distribution, cross-sectional community surveys were conducted in randomly selected households (at least 50 per cluster, 3,200 per survey).
FindingsIn the two years following LLIN distribution, 186,364 episodes of malaria were diagnosed in cluster residents during 398,931 person-years of follow-up.
Malaria incidence after 24-months was lower than at baseline in both arms (pyrethroid-PBO: 465 vs 676 episodes per 1000 person-years; pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen: 469 vs 674 episodes per 1000 person-years); but the difference between the arms was not statistically significant (incidence rate ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91- 1.22, p=0.47).
Two years post-distribution, ownership of at least one LLIN for every two household residents was low in both arms (41.1% pyrethroid-PBO vs 38.6% pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen).
Parasite prevalence in children aged 2-10 years was no different between the arms in either survey and similar results were observed for prevalence of anaemia in children aged 2-4 years.
InterpretationThe effectiveness of pyrethroid-PBO LLINs and pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen LLINs was no different in Uganda, but two years after mass distribution, LLIN coverage was inadequate.

Telemedicine and clinical care for Neglected Tropical Diseases in a post-pandemic world: where are we on the way to mitigate global inequities?
A scoping review  BackgroundNeglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) represent a global public health problem with great socioeconomic impact.
Using digital health technologies to provide medical care remotely can be an important strategy for reducing inequalities in access but is challenging in low-and middle-income settings and geographically isolated areas.
The objective of the current review was to identify and summarize international evidence on the use of telemedicine for clinical care of patients with NTD around the world based on a scoping review protocol.
Methodology/Principal FindingsA total of 422 articles were extracted from the databases MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus, and after remove 129 duplicates, 285 studies were excluded because they did not meet at least one of the eligibility criteria.
A total of 8 articles were included for data collection, published between 2006 and 2023, half of them after 2021 (n=4).
Fifty percent of the studies (n=4) were focused on dermatological diseases, like leprosy and leishmaniosis, and the other diseases found were dengue (n=2), trachoma (n=1) and cysticercosis (n=1).
Most of telemedicine interventions in NTD took place in South America (n=5), with emphasis on Brazil (n=2).
Studies that evaluated the accuracy of remote diagnosis demonstrated good effectiveness for leprosy, trachoma and complications of neurocysticercosis.
There was a significant reduction in the need for specialized in-person medical consultations with telemedicine for the care of dengue fever and some dermatological NTDs; and an improvement in the quality of clinical monitoring of cutaneous leishmaniasis using mobile health was related.
Conclusions/SignificanceThis scoping review mapped the existing evidence on telemedicine applied at clinical care for NTD.
Although we observed a small recent increase in academic research on the theme after COVID-19 pandemic, there is a gap in recommendations for the clinical management of NTDs through telemedicine, especially for synchronous approaches, revealing that this resource is still largely underutilized.

Household clustering and seasonal genetic variation of Plasmodium falciparum at the community-level in The Gambia  Understanding the genetic diversity and transmission dynamics of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, is crucial for effective control and elimination efforts.
In some endemic regions, malaria is highly seasonal with no or little transmission during up to 8 months, yet little is known about how seasonality affects the parasite population genetics.
Here we conducted a longitudinal study over 2.5 years on 1516 participants in the Upper River Region of The Gambia.
With 425 P. falciparum genetic barcodes genotyped from asymptomatic infections, we developed an identity by descent (IBD) based pipeline and validated its accuracy against 199 parasite genomes sequenced from the same isolates.
Genetic relatedness between isolates revealed a very low inbreeding level, suggesting continuous recombination among parasites rather than the dominance of specific strains.
However, isolates from the same household were six-fold more likely to be genetically related compared to those from other villages, suggesting close transmission links within households.
Seasonal variation also influenced parasite genetics, with most differentiation occurring during the transition from the low transmission season to the subsequent high transmission season.
Yet chronic infections presented exceptions, including one individual who had a continuous infection by the same parasite genotype for at least 18 months.
Our findings highlight the burden of asymptomatic chronic malaria carriers and the importance of characterising the parasite genetic population at the community-level.
Most importantly,  reactive approaches for malaria elimination should not be limited to acute malaria cases but be broadened to households of asymptomatic carriers.
Author SummaryMalaria, caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, remains a significant health challenge, particularly in regions like The Gambia where transmission is seasonal.
Our study explored how seasonal changes impact the genetic diversity and transmission patterns of P. falciparum within communities.
By tracking 1516 participants over 2.5 years and analyzing the genetic material of the parasites they carried, we discovered that malaria parasites in this region exhibit high genetic diversity, with frequent recombination events rather than dominance by specific strains.
Interestingly, we found that parasites from individuals within the same household were much more likely to be genetically related, suggesting close transmission links within households.
Seasonal shifts also influenced genetic relationships, with parasite populations becoming more diverse during peak transmission periods.
Notably, one individual carried the same parasite strain for over a year without showing symptoms, highlighting the hidden reservoir of chronic malaria infections.
Our findings suggest that malaria control strategies should extend beyond treating symptomatic cases to include household members of infected individuals, aiming to disrupt the wider transmission network within communities.
This approach could be crucial for advancing malaria elimination efforts in regions with similar transmission dynamics.
R21 malaria vaccine is protective against intradermal but not intravenous Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites in a randomized controlled human malaria infection study in Kenyan adults  Falciparum malaria is a substantial public health problem.
Vaccines and monoclonal antibodies targeting the Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) circumsporozoite protein (CSP) are promising control strategies.
The protective mechanisms of anti-PfCSP antibodies are incompletely understood, and levels of anti-PfCSP antibodies are inconsistently predictive of protection.
We undertook controlled human malaria infections in volunteers vaccinated with the PfCSP-based vaccine R21/Matrix-M, using either intradermal injection (ID) or direct venous inoculation (DVI) of P. falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ Challenge).
R21/Matrix-M was highly protective against intradermal inoculation of PfSPZ Challenge (i.e.
100%, 12 out of 12) but not protective against PfSPZ Challenge by DVI (i.e.
0%, 0 out of 5).
These findings imply that the variable delivery of Pf sporozoites into capillaries rather than the subdermal layers by infectious mosquito bites can account for the inconsistent protection provided by anti-PfCSP antibodies.
The role of a structured community health worker network in achieving malaria elimination goals in the Dominican Republic: an impact evaluation amid COVID-19 disruptions  Community health workers (CHWs) can play a key role in malaria elimination through expanding access to malaria testing and treatment.
The Dominican Republic, a low endemic country committed to eliminate malaria by 2025, implemented a structured malaria CHW network in the three main urban foci of Greater Santo Domingo.
This research quantifies the networks contributions towards malaria elimination from its implementation in 2019 until 2022.
The study highlights the impact of COVID-19 disruptions on CHWs performance and explores the networks ability to bounce back from health systems shocks.
The performance of a malaria CHW network in Greater Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic was evaluated using weekly data collected from CHWs and routinely collected surveillance data from the Ministry of Public Health (MoH).
We assess performance of CHWs by analyzing key variables such as (1) reporting compliance, (2) household visitation rates, (3) malaria rapid diagnostic tests performed, (4) malaria cases detected, and (5) time between symptom onset and malaria diagnosis.
To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the network, CHWs performance indicators are evaluated across three time periods (prior to, during, and after COVID-19 interruptions).
Results showed that over the evaluation period, reported malaria cases in study foci decreased from 1,243 cases in 2019 to 5 cases in 2023.
CHWs diagnosed and treated over 43% of malaria cases in study foci before COVID-19 interruptions and 14% during interruptions.
83% of cases detected by CHWs were detected through active case detection, with 17% detected passively.
CHWs detected malaria cases and initiated treatment 1.5 days earlier than health facilities and MoH personnel performing active case detection.
This evaluation provides evidence that a structured CHW network with clearly defined responsibilities and management protocol can assume a large proportion of malaria case management service provision, contribute to early malaria case detection, and help curb local malaria transmission.
It adds to a growing body of research on the feasibility and benefits of CHW-led proactive household visitation.
Despite interruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic, concerted investment can sustain CHW program gains.
Coaching visits and supportive supervision for primary care facilities to improve malaria service data quality in Ghana: an intervention case study  Effective decision-making for malaria prevention and control depends on timely, accurate, and appropriately analyzed and interpreted data.
Poor quality data reported into national health management information systems (HMIS) prevent managers at the district level from planning effectively for malaria in Ghana.
We analyzed reports from data coaching visits and follow-up supervision conducted to 231 health facilities in six of Ghanas 16 regions between February and November 2021.
The visits targeted health workers knowledge and skills in malaria data recording, HMIS reporting, and how managers visualized and used HMIS data for planning and decision making.
A before-after design was used to assess how data coaching visits affected data documentation practices and compliance with standards of practice, quality and completeness of national HMIS data, and use of facility-based malaria indicator wall charts for decision-making at health facilities.
The percentage of health workers demonstrating good understanding of standards of practice in documentation, reporting and data use increased from 72 to 83% (p<0.05).
At first follow-up, reliability of HMIS data entry increased from 29 to 65% (p<0.001); precision increased from 48 to 78% (p<0.001); and timeliness of reporting increased from 67 to 88% (p<0.001).
HMIS data showed statistically significant improvement in data completeness (from 62 to 87% (p<0.001)) and decreased error rate (from 37 to 18% (p<0.001)) from baseline to post-intervention.
By the second follow-up visit, 98% of facilities had a functional data management system (a 26-percentage-point increase from the first follow-up visit, p<0.0001), 77% of facilities displayed wall charts, and 63% reported using data for decision-making and local planning.
There are few documented examples of data coaching to improve malaria surveillance and service data quality.
Data coaching provides support and mentorship to improve data quality, visualization, and use, modeling how other malaria programs can use HMIS data effectively at the local level.
Efficacy, public health impact and optimal use of the Takeda dengue vaccine  Dengue is the most common arboviral infection, causing substantial morbidity and mortality globally.
The licensing of Qdenga, a second-generation vaccine developed by Takeda Pharmaceuticals, is therefore timely, but the potential public health impact of vaccination across transmission settings needs to be evaluated.
To address this, we characterised Qdengas efficacy profile using mathematical models calibrated to published clinical trial data and estimated the public health impact of routine vaccine use.
We estimate that vaccination of children aged over six years in moderate to high dengue transmission settings (seroprevalence at 9 years of age > 60%) could reduce the burden of hospitalised dengue by 10-22% on average over ten years.
We find some evidence of a risk of vaccine-induced disease enhancement in seronegative vaccine recipients for dengue serotypes 3 and 4, especially for children under six years of age.
Because of this, the benefits of vaccination in lower transmission settings are more uncertain, and more data on the long-term efficacy of Qdenga against serotypes 3 and 4 are needed.
Epidemiological inferences from serological responses to cross-reacting pathogens  Multiplex immunoassays are facilitating the parallel measurement of antibody responses against multiple antigenically-related pathogens, generating a wealth of high-dimensional data which depict complex antibody-antigen relationships.
In this study we develop a generalizable analytical framework to maximise inferences from multi-pathogen serological studies.
We fit the model to measurements of IgG antibody binding to 10 arboviral pathogens from a cross-sectional study in northwest Bangladesh with 1,453 participants.
We find evidence of endemic transmission of Japanese encephalitis virus as well as recent outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya viruses in this district.
Our estimates of antibody cross-reactivity were highly consistent with phylogenetic distances inferred from genetic data.
The presented analytical framework will be applicable to the growing number of multi-pathogen studies and will help support the integration of serological testing into disease surveillance platforms.
Socioeconomic Factors and Human Knowledge and Behaviours Associated with Aedes aegypti abundance in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.
BackgroundSince 2013, Burkina Faso has experienced regular dengue outbreaks, especially in Ouagadougou, the capital city, and Bobo-Dioulasso.
Insufficient knowledge of the disease and some daily practices and attitudes of the human population may contribute to the proliferation of the vector and subsequently to dengue transmission.
The objective of this study was to assess the levels of population knowledge of dengue and its primary vector, Aedes aegypti, and to elucidate the behavioural and environmental factors associated with the proliferation of this species.
MethodsA cross-sectional Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) survey was conducted among 514 individuals, in 514 houses concurrently with a survey on Ae.
aegypti larval sites, between September and October 2021 in three health districts (HDs) of Ouagadougou.
ResultsA proportion of94.36% of the respondents demonstrated knowledge of dengue, with 50% recognizing primary symptoms like fever and headaches, and 70.52% knowing about its transmission mode.
Only 53.51% could identify Aedes larval containers, while 14.04% were familiar with mosquito immature stages.
Certain practices were linked to increased dengue vector proliferation or biting, including water storage, open water containers, water-holding waste, and the absence of mosquito screens.
The study noted a high number and diversity of potential Aedes larval sites with elevated Stegomyia indices (Container Index >47%, House Index >86%, and Breteau Index >230) across all HDs.
Moreover, compound infestation by immature mosquitoes was correlated with tap water presence, resident count, and construction type.
ConclusionDespite the dengue outbreaks in the city of Ouagadougou over the past decade and the resulting awareness campaigns, population knowledge of dengue and its vector remains limited.
Discriminatory experiences and depression among Chinese lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals in the United States: A moderated mediation modeling analysis  Chinese individuals in the U.S. have suffered substantial discrimination during the COVID19 pandemic, a stressor exacerbated by multiple minority identities (e.g., sexual and gender minority).
This study aimed to explore the mechanisms of discriminatory experiences, specifically how it interacted with stressors like internalized homophobia and protective factors such as resilience, to affect depressive symptoms among Chinese individuals with multiple minority identities.
Between 2022-2023, 272 Chinese LGB individuals residing in the U.S. (Mean[age]=28.36; SD=5.01) was surveyed anonymously using the Everyday discrimination Scale, the Internalized Homophobia Scale, the Conner-Davidson Resilience scale, and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale.
Moderation and mediation analyses were conducted using STATA 17 and JASP 0.18.3.
Replicating the positive association between discriminatory experience and depressive symptoms, we found that discrimination explained depressive symptoms directly and through increasing internalized homophobia.
As a protective factor, resilience moderated the internalized homophobia-depressive symptoms link, but not the discrimination-depressive symptoms link.
For Chinese LGB individuals with higher levels of resilience, the positive impact of internalized homophobia on depressive symptoms was weaker compared to those with lower resilience.
Our findings further the understanding of the mediating and moderating mechanisms between discriminatory experiences and depressive symptoms among individuals with multiple minority identities.
Continued research and intervention development on promoting resilience and other protective factors tailored to Chinese LGB individuals in the U.S. are crucial for improving mental health.
Lineage B Genotype III of Dengue Virus Serotype 3 (DENV-3III_B) is responsible for Dengue Outbreak in Dire Dawa City, Ethiopia, 2023  BackgroundThe eastern parts of Ethiopia, including Dire Dawa City, have faced annual dengue fever (DF) outbreaks since 2013, resulting in substantial healthcare and economic consequences.
However, there remains a lack of comprehensive evidence regarding the specific dengue virus (DENV) serotypes and genotypes associated with those outbreaks.
MethodologyOn December 14, 2023, the National Arbovirus Laboratory at the Ethiopian Public Health Institute received seventy serum samples from 70 patients suspected of DF during the outbreak in Dire Dawa City.
Samples positive for DENV with adequate volume and CT values underwent sequencing of the CprM region of the DENV genome.
The obtained sequences were typed using the Dengue Virus Typing Tool and underwent phylogenetic analysis to evaluate sequence diversity and relationships to DENV strains from other global DENV-endemic regions.
ResultsOverall, 32 (45.7%) of the patients displayed one or more early warning signs indicative of severe dengue.
Among the 13 patients who were hospitalized for 2 to 10 days, all except two had at least one symptom indicative of severe dengue.
Out of 67 samples with adequate volume, 44 (65.6%) were positive for DENV RNA using RT-PCR, and 21 successfully underwent CprM sequencing.
All of them belonged to DENV-3, genotype III, major lineage B (DENV-3III_B), but represented two different minor lineages (DENV-3III_B.2 and DENV-3III_B.3).
Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that both lineages were closely related to sequences from the Afar region of Ethiopia collected in 2023, indicating that the outbreaks were related and were due to multiple co-circulating lineages.
ConclusionsDENV-3III_B was identified as the cause of the 2023 DF outbreak in Dire Dawa City.
The identification of two co-circulating lineages in this outbreak underscores the complex nature of DENV transmission in the African continent and highlights the need for increased viral genomic surveillance.
Temporal and interaction dynamics of dengue cases, entomological and meteorological variables in Melaka, Malaysia: A multivariate time series analysis.
The interaction between dengue cases, entomological and meteorological variables has remained intricate for decades.
This study aims to elucidate the relationship between the variables in the long run and short-term dynamic focusing in Melaka, Malaysia, in an attempt to improve the understanding of the variables and their temporal associations.
The research applies a Johansen Cointegration Test and Vector Error Correction Model to validate long term run and examine short-term deviations among dengue cases, temperature, ovitrap and sticky ovitrap data from 2020-2022.
Empirical findings prove that temperature, sticky ovitrap index (SOI) and ovitrap index (OI) has a significant and unique long-run equilibrium relationship with dengue cases.
The model fit elucidates 74.2% of the dynamics.
The VECM model provides an excellent trade-off between goodness of fit and complexity in describing the variables examined.
Previous dengue occurrences predicted a surge of new dengue cases while preserving the cyclical pattern.
The model predicts the utility and efficacy of sticky ovitraps.
It also validates ovitrap use as a surveillance tool and offers substantiation of the influence of temperature on the progression of dengue cases.
Determinants of self-treatment with antimalarials in Ndola district, Zambia: a cross-sectional study  Antimalarial drug resistance has been an obstacle in the fight against malaria over the years.
Antimalarial self-medication is one of the factors associated with antimalarial resistance, and is on the rise globally and has become quite common among developing populations.
Self-medication is when individuals choose and use medications to treat symptoms they perceive or diagnose themselves, without the guidance of a healthcare professional.
This study aimed at investigating prevalence and determinants of antimalarial drug self-medication among adults in Ndola district, Zambia.
A cross-sectional study was conducted among adults in Ndola district, Zambia in June 2023.
Using multistage cluster sampling, 446 participants were randomly selected and interviewed through a mobile-based structured questionnaire administered by the researchers using Kobo collect/kobo toolbox.
Data was then exported to Microsoft Excel, cleaned and coded, and thereafter exported to STATA version 16.1 for analysis.
Chi-square tests and logistic regression analysis was used to test associations between categorical variables and to estimate the odds of antimalarial drug self-medication associated with the explanatory variables.
The prevalence of antimalarial drug self-medication was 20% in this study population and the factors significantly associated were; moderate to mild illness, bad experience with hospital care, lack of knowledge about antimalarial drug resistance, and the perception that antimalarial drug self-medication was not risky.
The finding that antimalarial self-medication was common in this study population is suggestive of a poor state of the health-care delivery system possibly due to inadequate manpower, stock out of drugs in health facilities, and lack of awareness about the risks of self-medication.
In addition, authorities should repackage malaria sensitization messages to strongly highlight the risks of antimalarial drug self-medication.
Dengue nowcasting in Brazil by combining official surveillance data and Google Trends information  Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that poses significant public health challenges in tropical and sub-tropical regions worldwide.
Surveillance systems are essential for dengue prevention and control.
However, traditional systems often rely on delayed data, limiting their effectiveness.
This study evaluates the value of using Google Trends indices of dengue-related keywords to complement official dengue data for nowcasting dengue in Brazil, a country frequently affected by this disease.
We compare various nowcasting approaches that incorporate autoregressive features from official dengue cases, Google Trends data, and a combination of both, using a naive approach as a baseline.
The performance of these methods is evaluated by nowcasting weekly dengue cases from March to June 2024 across Brazilian states.
Error measures and 95% coverage probabilities reveal that models incorporating Google Trends data enhance the accuracy of weekly nowcasts across states and offer valuable insights into dengue activity levels.
To support real-time decision-making, we also present Dengue Tracker, a website that displays weekly dengue nowcasts and trends to inform both decision-makers and the public, improving situational awareness of dengue activity.
In conclusion, the study demonstrates the value of digital data sources in enhancing dengue nowcasting, and emphasizes the value of integrating alternative data streams into traditional surveillance systems for better-informed decision-making.
Author summaryDengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that poses significant public health challenges in tropical and sub-tropical regions worldwide.
Surveillance systems are crucial for dengue prevention and control.
Unfortunately, traditional systems often rely on delayed data, limiting their effectiveness.
This study evaluates how Google Trends indices of dengue-related keywords can complement official dengue data to improve nowcasting of dengue in Brazil, a country frequently affected by this disease.
We compare the performance of various nowcasting approaches that incorporate Google Trends data with other approaches that rely solely on official reported cases data, assessing their accuracy and uncertainty in nowcasting weekly dengue cases from March to June 2024 across Brazilian states.

Advancing Early Warning Systems for Malaria: Progress, Challenges, and Future Directions - A Scoping Review  BackgroundMalaria Early Warning Systems(EWS) are predictive tools that often use climatic and environmental variables to forecast malaria risk and trigger timely interventions.
Despite their potential benefits, the development and implementation of malaria EWS face significant challenges and limitations.
We reviewed the current evidence on malaria EWS, including their settings, methods, performance, actions, and evaluation.
MethodsWe conducted a comprehensive literature search using keywords related to EWS and malaria in various databases and registers.
We included primary research and programmatic reports focused on developing and implementing Malaria EWS.
We extracted and synthesized data on the characteristics, outcomes, and experiences of Malaria EWS.
ResultsAfter reviewing 5,535 records, we identified 30 studies from 16 countries that met our inclusion criteria.
The studies employed various statistical and machine-learning models to forecast malaria cases, often incorporating environmental covariates such as rainfall and temperature.
The most common mode used is the time series model.
The performance of the models was assessed using measures such as the Akaike Information Criterion( AIC), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and adjusted R squared(R 2).
The lack of standardized criteria and methodologies limited the evaluation of EWS impact.
ConclusionsThis review provides a comprehensive overview of the current status of Malaria EWS, highlighting the progress, challenges, and gaps in the field.
The review informs and guides policymakers, researchers, and practitioners in enhancing EWS and malaria control strategies.
The review also underscores the need for further research on the integration, sustainability, and evaluation of Malaria EWS usage and harmonized methods to ease review.
Understanding the primary healthcare context in rural South and Southeast Asia: a village profiling study  The use of comprehensive village profiles is one way of characterising contextual factors important for the implementation of primary healthcare interventions and service planning in rural areas.
This study aimed to address this gap, as well as compare high-level data from representative under-served and understudied villages across seven sites in five countries (Thailand (n=3), Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Bangladesh).
A survey-based approach using key informants supplemented by other relevant information sources was used to collect data from 687 of 707 villages participating in the South and Southeast Asian Community-based Trials Network.
Data on four key health and socio-economic indicators (literacy rate, percentage of attended deliveries, percentage of fully-immunised children, and percentage of latrine coverage) as well as access to health services, public utilities, and education were collected and analysed using descriptive statistics.
There was considerable variation between sites in terms of health and socio-economic indicators given that the countries are at different stages of development, and also between the three sites in Thailand.
Five of the seven sites were highly diverse ethno-culturally and linguistically, and all were reliant on primary health centres as well as village health workers/village malaria workers as the main providers of primary healthcare.
These were generally bypassed by severely ill patients in favour of first-level referral hospitals and private sector facilities in towns.
Over 70% of villages at each site had mobile phone coverage and availability of electricity was high ([&ge;]65% at all sites bar Myanmar).
Population Genomics of Plasmodium malariae from Four African Countries  Plasmodium malariae is geographically widespread but neglected and may become more prevalent as P. falciparum declines.
We completed the largest genomic study of African P. malariae to-date by performing hybrid capture and sequencing of 77 isolates from Cameroon (n=7), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (n=16), Nigeria (n=4), and Tanzania (n=50) collected between 2015 and 2021.
Nucleotide diversity was significantly lower than in co-localized P. falciparum isolates, while linkage disequilibrium was significantly higher.
Genome-wide selection scans identified no erythrocyte invasion ligands or antimalarial resistance orthologs as top hits; however, targeted analyses of these loci revealed evidence of selective sweeps around four erythrocyte invasion ligands and six antimalarial resistance orthologs.
Demographic inference modeling suggests that African P. malariae is recovering from a bottleneck.
Altogether, these results suggest that P. malariae is genomically atypical among human Plasmodium spp.
and panmictic in Africa.
Co-developing a comprehensive disease policy model with stakeholders: the case of malaria during pregnancy  IntroductionUnderstanding the holistic impact of malaria during pregnancy is essential for improving maternal and child outcomes in malaria endemic settings.
This study aimed to illustrate a methodology to co-develop a disease model with expert stakeholders using malaria during pregnancy as a case study.
MethodsAn initial steering group was convened to develop a first model of malaria during pregnancy and its consequences for mother and child based on their understanding of the literature.
Subsequently, this model was refined using a Delphi process to gain consensus amongst twelve experts, representing the disciplines of health economics, mathematical modelling, epidemiology and clinical medicine, working in the field of malaria during pregnancy.
Experts reviewed drafts of the conceptual model and provided feedback in two rounds of semi-structured questionnaires with the aim of identifying the most important health outcomes and relationships in both mother and child as well as the most relevant stratifiers for the model.
ResultsThe final model is a comprehensive disease model of malaria during pregnancy, including ten maternal and ten child outcomes with four stratifiers.
The model developed in this study should be of value to malaria researchers, funders, evaluators and decision makers, though some adaptation will be required for each specific context and purpose.
Discussion & ConclusionThe model resulting from this study highlights the complexity required to depict appropriately the consequences of malaria during pregnancy for both the mother and the child.
FundingThis study from part of the IMPROVE and IMPROVE-2 studies, which received financial support from the EDCTP2 programme under Horizon 2020 (TRIA.2015-1076, TRIA.2015-1076b); the UK Department of Health and Social Care, the UK Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office, the UK Medical Research Council, and Wellcome Trust, through the Joint Global Health Trials scheme (MR/P006922/1); and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency.
Public communication and outreach by mosquito programs in the United States  Blood feeding female mosquitoes cause itchy welts and can transmit pathogens that cause diseases such as chikungunya, malaria, West Nile encephalitis, and Zika.
Mosquito control programs conduct mosquito, pathogen, and epidemiological surveillance, carry out source reduction, treat mosquito habitats with larvicides or adulticides, and disseminate information to the public.
Here, 100 organizations (e.g., private/public mosquito control programs, national professional mosquito/pest control associations) in the United States were asked to complete a survey (N=39 respondents) about their public communication and outreach efforts.
A checklist was constructed to compare communication strategies between a subset of program websites and Facebook pages.
Recommendations for improving public communication and outreach strategies for mosquito control programs are discussed.
High Seroprevalence to Aedes-borne arboviruses in Ethiopia: a Cross-sectional Survey in 2024  Aedes-borne diseases infect millions of people each year.
In the last decade several arbovirus outbreaks have been reported in Ethiopia.
Arbovirus diagnosis and surveillance is lacking and the true burden is unknown.
In this study we conducted a seroprevalence survey using a commercially available test kit that that tests for immunological responses to IgM and IgG for dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses in Dire Dawa city, eastern Ethiopia.
We found a high IgG seroprevalence for DENV (76%), CHIKV (44%), and ZIKV (38%), and <20% IgM seropositivity across all viruses.
As a comparison, we conducted serosurveillance in Addis Ababa, the national capital with no reported history of arbovirus outbreaks.
The highest seropositivity we found was to IgM for DENGV at approximately 3%.
Subnational tailoring of malaria interventions for strategic planning and prioritization: experience and perspectives of five malaria programs  In the context of high malaria burden and insufficient resources, several national malaria programs (NMPs) used subnational tailoring (SNT) as a tool for evidence-informed decision-making on their national malaria strategic plans and funding requests.
Analysis steps of SNT were supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners.
As SNT was a new approach, this study used semi-structured interviews to understand the perspectives and experiences of personnel from five NMPs (Burkina Faso, Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria, and Togo) that undertook SNT between 2019 and 2023.
Participants reported that SNT outputs were used to inform national strategic plans and prioritized plans, that the process incentivized improvements in data collection and data quality, and that NMPs were strongly motivated to grow their capacity to conduct more steps of the SNT analysis process internally.
Participants reported a moderate to strong sense of ownership over the process and were eager to extend, adapt, and reuse the SNT process in the future.
Among countries supported by WHO, SNT was well-accepted and allowed NMPs to successfully use evidence to inform their decision-making, advocate for themselves, and mobilize resources.
Antibody response to Plasmodium vivax in the context of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) co-infection: A 14-year follow-up study in the Amazon rainforest  BackgroundTo develop an effective vaccine against Plasmodium vivax, the most widely dispersed human malaria parasite, it is critical to understand how coinfections with other pathogens could impact malaria-specific immune response.
A recent conceptual study proposed that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a highly prevalent human herpesvirus that establishes lifelong persistent infection, may influence P. vivax antibody responses.
Here, it was investigated whether EBV could impact the longevity of humoral immune response to P. vivax.
Methodology/principal findingsA 14-year follow-up study was carried out among long-term P. vivax-exposed Amazonian individuals (272, median age 35 years), and included 9 cross-sectional surveys at periods of high and low malaria transmission.
The experimental approach focused on monitoring antibodies to the major blood-stage P. vivax vaccine candidate, the Duffy binding protein region II (DBPII-Sal1), including a novel engineered DBPII-based vaccine targeting conserved epitopes (DEKnull-2).
In parallel, the status of EBV infection was determined over time by the detection of circulating EBV DNA (EBV-DNAemia) and EBV-specific antibodies to lytic (VCAp18) or latent (EBNA1) antigens.
Regardless of the malaria transmission period, the results demonstrated that one or multiple episodes of EBV-DNAemia did not influence the longevity of DBPII immune responses to both strain-specific (Sal-1) or strain-transcending (DEKnull-2) antibodies.
Also, the average time in which DBPII-responders lost their antibodies was unrelated to the EBV serostatus.
Considering all malaria cases detected during the study, there was a predominance of P. vivax mono-infection (76%), with a positive association between malaria infection and detectable EBV-DNAemia.
Conclusions/significanceIn an immunocompetent P. vivax-exposed adult population neither sporadic episodes of EBV-DNAemia nor antibody responses to lytic/latent EBV antigens influence the longevity of both strain-specific and strain-transcending DBPII immune responses.
Further studies should investigate the role of acute P. vivax infection in the activation of EBV replication cycle.
Predictive Time Series Modeling of Malaria Incidence in India: A 20-Year Retrospective and 5-Year Forecast.
BackgroundMalaria poses a significant health challenge in India, with notable contributions to the global malaria burden.
This study aims to analyze trends in malaria incidence in India over the past two decades, evaluating the effectiveness of public health interventions.
ObjectiveThe objective of this study is to analyze trends in malaria incidence in India over the past decades, evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions, and project future trends in order to support the countrys goal of malaria elimination by 2030.
MethodsA comprehensive 20-year dataset was utilized to conduct time series analyses, including linear regression and ARIMA modeling.
The linear regression model assessed the trend in malaria incidence per 1,000 population at risk, while the ARIMA model was used for forecasting future trends.
Residuals were evaluated for adequacy to ensure model reliability.
ResultsThe linear regression analysis revealed a significant annual decrease in malaria incidence by approximately 0.92 units (p < 0.001), explaining 90.77% of the variability in the data.
The ARIMA model forecasts indicate a continued decline, projecting negative incidence values by 2026 and 2027, despite some residual autocorrelation suggesting further model refinement may be necessary.
DiscussionThese findings highlight the effectiveness of current public health strategies and the importance of ongoing monitoring to address remaining challenges.
The projected downward trend aligns with Indias goal of malaria elimination by 2030, reinforcing the need for sustained interventions in high-burden areas.
ConclusionThis study underscores the positive impact of public health initiatives on malaria incidence in India, while emphasizing the necessity for continuous research and adaptive strategies to achieve the ambitious target of malaria eradication by 2030.
The transmission blocking activity of artemisinin-combination, non-artemisinin, and 8-aminoquinoline antimalarial therapies: a pooled analysis of individual participant data.
BackgroundInterrupting human-to-mosquito transmission is important for malaria elimination strategies as it can reduce infection burden in communities and slow the spread of drug resistance.
Antimalarial medications differ in their efficacy in clearing the transmission stages of Plasmodium falciparum (gametocytes) and in preventing mosquito infection.
Here we present a combined analysis of six trials conducted at the same study site with highly consistent methodologies that allows for a direct comparison of the gametocytocidal and transmission-blocking activities of fifteen different antimalarial regimens or dosing schedules.
Methods and findingsBetween January 2013 and January 2023, six clinical trials with transmission endpoints were conducted at the Clinical Research Centre of the Malaria Research and Training Centre of the University of Bamako in Mali.
These trials tested Artemisinin-Combination Therapies (ACTs), non-ACT regimens and combinations with 8-aminoquinolines.
Participants were males and non-pregnant females, between 5-50 years of age, who presented with P. falciparum mono-infection and gametocyte carriage by microscopy.
Blood samples were taken before and after treatment for thick film microscopy, infectivity assessments by mosquito feeding assays and molecular quantification of gametocytes.
Mixed-effects generalized linear models were fit with individual-specific random effects and fixed effects for time points, treatment groups and their interaction.
Models quantified changes in mosquito infection rates and gametocyte densities within treatment arms over time and between treatments.
In a pooled analysis of 422 participants, we observed substantial differences between ACTs in gametocytocidal and transmission-blocking activities, with artemether-lumefantrine (AL) being significantly more potent at reducing mosquito infection rates within 48 hours than dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ), artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) and pyronaridine-artesunate (PY-AS) (p<0.0001).
The addition of single low dose primaquine (SLD PQ) accelerated gametocyte clearance and led to a significantly greater reduction in mosquito infection rate within 48-hours of treatment for each ACT, while an SLD of the 8-aminoaquinoline tafenoquine (TQ) showed a delayed but effective response compared to SLD primaquine.
Finally, our findings confirmed considerably higher post-treatment transmission after sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine (SP-AQ) compared to most ACTs, with a significantly lower relative reduction in mosquito infection rate at day 7 compared to DHA-PPQ, AS-AQ, and AL (p<0.0001).
Therefore, adding an SLD PQ to SP-AQ may be beneficial to block malaria transmission in community treatment campaigns.
ConclusionsWe found marked differences among ACTs and single low-dose 8-aminoquinoline drugs in their ability and speed to block transmission.
The findings from this analysis can support treatment policy decisions for malaria elimination and be integrated into mathematical models to improve the accuracy of predictions regarding community transmission and the spread of drug resistance under varying treatment guidelines.
Application of a new highly multiplexed amplicon sequencing tool to evaluate Plasmodium falciparum antimalarial resistance and relatedness in individual and pooled samples from Dschang, Cameroon  BackgroundResistance to antimalarial drugs remains a major obstacle to malaria elimination.
Multiplexed, targeted amplicon sequencing is being adopted for surveilling resistance and dissecting the genetics of complex malaria infections.
Moreover, genotyping of parasites and detection of molecular markers drug resistance in resource-limited regions requires open-source protocols for processing samples, using accessible reagents, and rapid methods for processing numerous samples including pooled sequencing.
MethodsPlasmodium falciparum Streamlined Multiplex Antimalarial Resistance and Relatedness Testing (Pf-SMARRT) is a PCR-based amplicon panel consisting of 15 amplicons targeting antimalarial resistance mutations and 9 amplicons targeting hypervariable regions.
This assay uses oligonucleotide primers in two pools and a non-proprietary library and barcoding approach.
ResultsWe evaluated Pf-SMARRT using control mocked dried blood spots (DBS) at varying levels of parasitemia and a mixture of 3D7 and Dd2 strains at known frequencies, showing the ability to genotype at low parasite density and recall within-sample allele frequencies.
We then piloted Pf-SMARRT to genotype 100 parasite isolates collected from uncomplicated malaria cases at three health facilities in Dschang, Western Cameroon.
Antimalarial resistance genotyping showed high levels of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance mutations, including 31% prevalence of the DHPS A613S mutation.
No K13 candidate or validated artemisinin partial resistance mutations were detected, but one low-level non-synonymous change was observed.
Pf-SMARRTs hypervariable targets, used to assess complexity of infections and parasite diversity and relatedness, showed similar levels and patterns compared to molecular inversion probe (MIP) sequencing.
While there was strong concordance of antimalarial resistance mutations between individual samples and pools, low-frequency variants in the pooled samples were often missed.
ConclusionOverall, Pf-SMARRT is a robust tool for assessing parasite relatedness and antimalarial drug resistance markers from both individual and pooled samples.
Control samples support that accurate genotyping as low as 1 parasite per microliter is routinely possible.
SCOPE STATEMENT (200)Malaria remains a critical global public health problem.
Antimalarial drug resistance has repeatedly undermined control and the emergence of artemisinin partial resistance in Africa is the latest major challenge.
Malaria molecular surveillance (MMS) has emerged as a powerful tool to monitor molecular markers of resistance and changes in the parasite population.
We developed Plasmodium falciparum Streamlined Multiplex Antimalarial Resistance and Relatedness Testing (Pf-SMARRT), a multiplex amplicon deep sequencing approach that uses easily accessible products without proprietary steps and can be sequenced on any Illumina sequencer.
We validated this tool using controls, including mocked dried blood spots, and then implemented it to evaluate resistance and parasite relatedness among 100 samples from Cameroon.
The assay was able to reliably assess the within-sample allele frequency of antimalarial resistance markers and discriminate strains within and between individuals.
We also evaluated a more cost-effective surveillance approach for antimalarial resistance polymorphisms using pooled samples.
While within-pool frequencies of mutations were accurate in pools with higher numbers of samples, this resulted in the loss of the ability to detect variants uncommon in the pool.
Overall Pf-SMARRT provides a new protocol for conducting MMS that is easily implementable in Africa.
Low prevalence of soil transmitted helminth infection in Ugandan children hospitalized with severe malaria  Co-infection by intestinal helminths and Plasmodium spp.
Several studies have identified a relationship between helminth infection, Plasmodium spp.
infection and malaria severity.
We analyzed 202 stool samples from a cohort of children with severe malaria enrolled in two hospitals in Uganda from 2014-2017 and asymptomatic community children from the same household or neighborhood and enrolled at the same time, all 6 months to 48 months of age.
We investigated if intestinal helminth infection modified risk of severe malaria.
We extracted nucleic acids from stool and tested them for six helminth species (Anyclostoma duodenale, Ascaris lumbricoides, Necator americanus, Strongyloides stercolaris, Trichuris trichiura, Shistosoma mansoni) using highly sensitive quantitative PCR.
We found a low prevalence of infection by [&ge;]1 intestinal helminth species in children with severe malaria (5.1%, n=9/177) and community control children (4.0%, n=1/25).
Infection by [&ge;]1 of the helminths assessed was not associated with severe malaria (aRR = 1.0, 95% Confidence Interval = 0.82, 1.3, p = 0.78).
In 2003 Uganda instituted a national deworming program, with anti-helminth medication provided twice annually to children 6 months to 5 years of age.
In these areas of Uganda, the national deworming campaign has been highly successful, as stool-based helminth infection was rare even when using highly sensitive methods of detection and was not a major contributor to risk of severe malaria.
A Decade of Progress in HIV, Malaria, and Tuberculosis Initiatives in Malawi  ObjectiveHuge investments in HIV, TB, and malaria (HTM) control in Malawi have greatly reduced disease burden.
MethodsAn integrated epidemiological and health system model was used to assess the impact of HTM programmes in Malawi from 2010 to 2019, incorporating interacting disease dynamics, intervention effects, and health system usage.
Four scenarios were examined, comparing actual programme delivery with hypothetical scenarios excluding programmes individually and collectively.
FindingsFrom 2010-2019, HTM programmes were estimated to have prevented 1.08 million deaths and 74.89 million DALYs.
An additional 15,600 deaths from other causes were also prevented.
Life expectancy increased by 13.0 years for males and 16.9 years for females.
The HTM programmes accounted for 24.2% of all health system interactions, including 157.0 million screening/diagnostic tests and 23.2 million treatment appointments.
Accounting for the anticipated health deterioration without HTM services, only 41.55 million additional healthcare worker hours were required (17.1% of total healthcare worker time) to achieve these gains.
The HTM programme eliminated the need for 123 million primary care appointments, offset by a net increase in inpatient care demand (9.4 million bed-days) that would have been necessary in its absence.
ConclusionsHTM programmes have greatly increased life expectancy, providing direct and spillover effects on health.
Safety and efficacy of the blood-stage malaria vaccine RH5.1/Matrix-M in Burkina Faso: interim results of a double-blind, randomised, controlled phase 2b trial in children  BackgroundTwo pre-erythrocytic vaccines (R21/Matrix-M and RTS,S/AS01) are now approved for P. falciparum malaria.
However, neither induces blood-stage immunity against parasites that breakthrough from the liver.
RH5.1/Matrix-M, a blood-stage P. falciparum malaria vaccine candidate, was highly immunogenic in Tanzanian adults and children.
We therefore assessed the safety and efficacy of RH5.1/Matrix-M in Burkinabe children.
MethodsIn this double-blind, randomised, controlled phase 2b trial, RH5.1/Matrix-M was given to children aged 5-17 months in Nanoro, Burkina Faso - a seasonal malaria transmission setting.
Children received either three intramuscular vaccinations with 10 {micro}g RH5.1 protein with 50 {micro}g Matrix-M adjuvant or three doses of rabies control vaccine, Rabivax-S, given either in a delayed third dose (0-1-5-month) regimen (first cohort) or a 0-1-2-month regimen (second cohort).
Vaccinations were completed part-way through the malaria season.
Children were randomly assigned 2:1 within each cohort to receive RH5.1/Matrix-M or Rabivax-S.
Participants were assigned according to a random allocation list generated by an independent statistician using block randomisation with variable block sizes.
Participants, their families, and the study teams were masked to group allocation; only pharmacists who prepared the vaccines were unmasked.
Co-primary objectives assessed were: i) safety and reactogenicity of RH5.1/Matrix-M, and ii) protective efficacy of RH5.1/Matrix-M against clinical malaria from 14 days to 6 months post-third vaccination in the per-protocol population.
FindingsFrom 6th to 13th April and 3rd to 7th July 2023, 412 children aged 5-17 months were screened, and 51 were excluded.
A total of 361 children were enrolled in this study.
In the first cohort, 119 were assigned to the RH5.1/Matrix-M delayed third dose group, and 62 to the equivalent rabies control group.
The second cohort included 120 children in the monthly RH5.1/Matrix-M group and 60 in the equivalent rabies control group.
The final vaccination was administered to all groups from 4th to 21st September 2023.
RH5.1/Matrix-M in both cohorts had a favourable safety profile and was well tolerated.
Most adverse events were mild, with the most common being local swelling and fever.
No serious adverse events were reported.
A Cox regression model was used to analyse the primary endpoint of time to first episode of clinical malaria, according to the primary case definition, within 14 days to 6 months post-third vaccination.
Comparing the RH5.1/Matrix-M delayed third dose regimen with the pooled control groups resulted in vaccine efficacy of 55% (95% CI 20-75%; p=0{middle dot}0071).
The same analysis showed a vaccine efficacy of 40% (95% CI -3-65%; p=0{middle dot}066) when comparing the monthly regimen with the pooled control groups.
Participants vaccinated with RH5.1/Matrix-M in both cohorts showed high concentrations of anti-RH5.1 serum IgG antibodies 14 days post-third vaccination, and the purified IgG showed high levels of in vitro growth inhibition activity (GIA) against P. falciparum; these responses were higher in RH5.1/Matrix-M vaccinees who received the delayed third dose, as opposed to monthly, regimen.
InterpretationRH5.1/Matrix-M appears safe and highly immunogenic in African children and shows promising efficacy against clinical malaria when given in a delayed third dose regimen.

Microhaplotype deep sequencing assays to capture Plasmodium vivax infection lineages  The elimination of Plasmodium vivax is challenged by dormant liver stages (hypnozoites) that can reactivate months after initial infection resulting in relapses that enhance transmission.
Relapsing infections confound antimalarial clinical efficacy trials due to the inability to distinguish between recurrences arising from blood-stage treatment failure (recrudescence), reinfection or relapse.
Genetic relatedness of paired parasite isolates, measured by identity-by-descent (IBD), can provide important information on whether individuals have had single or multiple mosquito inoculations, thus informing on recurrence origin.
We developed a high-throughput amplicon sequencing assay comprising 93 multi-SNP (microhaplotype) P. vivax markers to determine IBD between P. vivax clinical isolates.
We developed a high-throughput amplicon sequencing assay comprising 93 multi-SNP (microhaplotype) P. vivax markers to determine IBD between P. vivax clinical isolates.
We developed a high-throughput amplicon sequencing assay comprising 93 multi-SNP (microhaplotype) P. vivax markers to determine IBD between P. vivax clinical isolates.
The assay was evaluated in 659 independent infections from the Asia-Pacific and Horn of Africa, including 108 pairs of infections from a randomized controlled trial (RCT).
A bioinformatics pipeline (vivaxGEN-MicroHaps) was established to support data processing.
Simulations using paneljudge demonstrated low error in pairwise IBD estimation in all countries assessed (all RMSE <0.12) and IBD-based networks illustrated strong clustering by geography.
IBD analysis in the RCT demonstrated a higher frequency of suspected relapses or recrudescence in patients treated with primaquine regimens (0.84) compared to those without primaquine (0.60).
Our results demonstrate the potential to derive information on P. vivax IBD using amplicon sequencing, that informs policy-relevant treatment and transmission dynamics.
Arboviruses in Kenya: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Prevalence  Arboviruses cause >700,000 human deaths annually, with Rift Valley fever (RFV), yellow fever (YF), chikungunya, and dengue outbreaks posing major public health and economic challenges in East Africa.
Yet, no comprehensive studies have consolidated Kenyas historical arboviral data to support risk assessment and inform control strategies.
We registered this review in PROSPERO (CRD42023407963) and searched Web of Science, PubMed, and Global Health databases for observational articles reporting prevalence from the three main arboviral families from inception until 15th March 2023.
We pooled the IgG prevalence of arboviruses using a random-effects meta-analysis with a generalised linear mixed-effects model.
Heterogeneity was assessed and quantified using Cochrans Q and I2 statistics and 95% prediction intervals estimated.
We included 65 articles (246 datapoints; 14 arboviruses) in our analysis.
The pooled IgG prevalence of RVF was 16% (95% CI: 11-24%; I{superscript 2}=70%) in wildlife, 10% (95% CI: 8-13%; I{superscript 2}=90%) in livestock, and 7% (95% CI: 4-11%; I{superscript 2}=98%) in humans, with consistently high rates observed in Garissa and Tana River counties.
Among Aedes-borne viruses, chikungunya showed the highest prevalence (10%; 95% CI: 4-24%; I{superscript 2}=99%), followed by dengue (6%; 95% CI: 3-11%; I{superscript 2}=98%) and YF (5%; 95% CI: 2-11%; I{superscript 2}=97%), with the highest prevalence in Busia and Kwale.
West Nile virus prevalence in humans was also estimated at 9% (95% CI: 5-14%; I{superscript 2}=93%).
Overall, the Coast, Western, and Rift Valley regions were the most affected.
Multiple arboviruses have historically circulated Kenya, and with the increasing pressures of climate change, urbanization, and global connectivity, the risk of outbreaks, particularly from Aedes-borne viruses, is escalating.
Proactive, sustained surveillance as well as integrated public health strategies through a One Health lens are needed to mitigate these threats and protect vulnerable populations.
Author SummaryInfections like Rift Valley fever, dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and West Nile virus are major neglected tropical diseases that pose significant public health threats both in Kenya and globally.
It is therefore imperative to conduct a thorough assessment of baseline prevalence for these diseases through a systematic review and meta-analysis that consolidates and analyses existing evidence for improved public health planning.
Our study provides a detailed review of historical IgG prevalence data for 14 of these diseases in Kenya, illustrating their long-standing circulation in human, livestock, and wildlife populations, as well as the heightened risk of outbreaks driven by climate change and urbanization.
Extreme weather events and dengue in Southeast Asia: a regionally-representative analysis of 291 locations from 1998 to 2021  BackgroundClimate change, leading to more frequent and intense extreme weather events (EWEs), could significantly impact dengue transmission.
However, the associations between EWEs and dengue remains underexplored in the Southeast Asia (SEA) region.
heatwaves, extremely wet, and drought conditions) and dengue in the SEA region.
Methods and FindingsMonthly dengue case reports were obtained from 291 locations across eight SEA countries between 1998 and 2021.
Heatwaves are defined as the monthly total number of days where temperatures exceed the 95th percentile for at least two consecutive days.
Droughts and extremely wet conditions are defined by a self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI).
We implemented a generalized additive mixed model coupled with a distributed lag non-linear model to estimate the association between each EWE and dengue.
Months with fewer than 12 heatwave days increased dengue risk with delayed effect after two months lag, compared with months without any heatwave.
Highest dengue risk is at 7 heatwave days (RR=1{middle dot}28; 95%CI: 1{middle dot}19,1{middle dot}38).
Compared to normal conditions (i.e.
scPDSI=0), drought conditions (i.e.
scPDSI=-4) were positively associated with dengue risk (RR=1{middle dot}85; 95%CI: 1{middle dot}73,1{middle dot}99), while extremely wet conditions (i.e.
scPDSI=4) have reduced dengue risk (RR=0{middle dot}89; 95%CI: 0{middle dot}87,0{middle dot}91).
Although the findings of this study are significant, its limitations arise from the inconsistency of dengue case reporting, which might complicate dengue risk estimation.
ConclusionsThis study shows that the delayed effect of heatwaves and drought conditions magnifies the risk of dengue in the SEA region.
Our findings offer stakeholders sizeable amount of time to organize and implement public health interventions in minimizing the prospective dengue risk, posed by EWEs in the context of climate change in SEA.
Future research may focus on factors associated with dengue risk variations within SEA region to facilitate the development of location-based, tailor-fit mitigation and preventative interventions.
Ensemble Approaches for Robust and Generalizable Short-Term Forecasts of Dengue Fever.
A retrospective and prospective evaluation study in over 180 locations around the world  Dengue fever, a tropical vector-borne disease, is a leading cause of hospitalization and death in many parts of the world, especially in Asia and Latin America.
In places where timely and accurate dengue activity surveillance is available, decision-makers possess valuable information that may allow them to better design and implement public health measures, and improve the allocation of limited public health resources.
In addition, robust and reliable near-term forecasts of likely epidemic outcomes may further help anticipate increased demand on healthcare infrastructure and may promote a culture of preparedness.
Here, we propose ensemble modeling approaches that combine forecasts produced with a variety of independent mechanistic, statistical, and machine learning component models to forecast reported dengue case counts 1-, 2-, and 3-months ahead of current time at the province level in multiple countries.
We assess the ensemble and each component models monthly predictive ability in a fully out-of-sample and retrospective fashion, in over 180 locations around the world -- all provinces of Brazil, Colombia, Malaysia, Mexico, and Thailand, as well as Iquitos, Peru, and San Juan, Puerto Rico -- during at least 2-3 years.
Additionally, we evaluate ensemble approaches in a multi-model, real-time, and prospective dengue forecasting platform -- where issues of data availability and data completeness introduce important limitations -- during an 11-month time period in the years 2022 and 2023.
We show that our ensemble modeling approaches lead to reliable and robust prediction estimates when compared to baseline estimates produced with available information at the time of prediction.
Furthermore, we find that no individual model leads to optimal and robust predictions across time horizons and locations, and while the ensemble models do not always achieve the best prediction performance in any given location, they consistently provide reliable disease estimates -- they rank in the top 3 performing models across locations and time periods -- both retrospectively and prospectively.
A nationwide joint spatial modelling of simultaneous epidemics of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in Colombia  BackgroundChikungunya, and Zika emerged in the 2010s in the Americas, causing simultaneous epidemics with dengue.
However, little is known of these Aedes-borne diseases (ABDs) joint patterns and contributors at the population-level.
MethodsWe applied a novel Poisson-multinomial spatial model to the registered cases of dengue (n=291,820), chikungunya (n=75,913), and Zika (n=72,031) by municipality in Colombia, 2014-2016.
This model estimates the relative risk of total ABDs cases and associated factors, and, simultaneously, the odds of presence and contributors of each disease using dengue as a baseline category.
FindingsWe found an increased ABDs risk in valleys and south of the Andes, the Caribbean coast, and borders, with temperature as the main contributor (Relative Risk 2.32, 95% Credible Interval, CrI, 2.05-2.64).
Generally, dengue presence was the most probable among the ABDs, although that of Zika was greater on Caribbean islands.
Chikungunya and Zika were more likely present than dengue in municipalities with less vegetation (Odds Ratio, OR, 0.75, 95%CrI 0.65-0.86, and 0.85, 95%CrI 0.74-0.99, respectively).
Chikungunya tended to be present in more socially vulnerable areas than dengue (OR 1.20, 95%CrI 0.99-1.44) and Zika (OR 1.19, 95%CrI 0.95-1.48).
InterpretationImportant differences between the ABDs were identified and can help guide local and context-specific interventions, such as those aimed at preventing cases importation in border and tourism locations and reducing chikungunya burden in socially vulnerable regions.
Malaria prevention in the age of climate change: A community survey in rural Senegal  BackgroundMalaria results in over 600,000 deaths per year, with 95 percent of all cases occurring in sub-Saharan Africa.
Despite significant steady reductions from 2000 to 2015, there has been a recent resurgence.
The estimated 2025 Africa death rate was recalculated to be 51.8 people per 100,000, whereas the previous estimate was 15.9.
A potential explanation for this very significant setback is that increasing temperatures associated with global warming have made it more difficult to use insecticide treated mosquito nets.
This study evaluated a rural west African population to determine barriers to mosquito net use, including heat and outdoor sleeping.
MethodsThis study used a social ecological framework used by the Peace Corps to determine this communitys barriers to malaria prevention.
We practiced community-based participatory research by developing and implementing a survey in rural southeast Senegal.
Local village health workers were trained specifically to implement this survey.
Observations of the mosquito nets and sleeping spaces were performed by surveyors.
164 households in 20 villages were surveyed from October to November of 2012.
Results164 of 164 selected households were surveyed, giving a 100% response rate, representing 21% of this local population.
For the 1806 family members, respondents assessed a total need of 1565 nets, implying that each individual in this area needs 0.86 nets (95% CI: 0.77-0.95).
The main reasons for not using an available net were heat and fragility of the nets.
This population had very positive attitudes regarding mosquito nets and appreciated the work of local malaria educators.
ConclusionsThe estimated need of 0.86 nets per person is 54% higher than the World Health Organization recommendation.
Heat was found to be a major barrier in using a mosquito net, causing more people to sleep on outdoor structures.
This studys findings suggest the ratio of nets to people may need to be adjusted for the substantial increase in outdoor sleeping.
Head of household responses in this population were found to have no systemic bias and would be an accurate way to assess a familys need of nets.
Deploying more malaria educators to this area would be appreciated and beneficial.
Application of ConvNeXt with Transfer Learning and Data Augmentation for Malaria Parasite Detection in Resource-Limited Settings Using Microscopic Images  Malaria is one of the most widespread and deadly diseases across the globe, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the developing world.
Existing diagnostic techniques mainly depend on the microscopic identification of parasites in the blood smear stained with special dyes, which have drawbacks such as being time-consuming, depending on skilled personnel and being vulnerable to errors.
This work seeks to overcome these challenges by proposing a deep learning-based solution in the ConvNeXt architecture incorporating transfer learning and data augmentation to automate malaria parasite identification in thin blood smear images.
This studys dataset was a set of blood smear images of equal numbers of parasitised and uninfected samples drawn from a public database of malaria patients in Bangladesh.
To detect malaria in the given dataset of parasitised and uninfected blood smears, the ConvNeXt models were fine-tuned.
To improve the effectiveness of these models, a vast number of data augmentation strategies was used so that the models could work well in various image capture conditions and perform well even in environments with limited resources.
On the other hand, the re-modified version of the ConvNeXt V2 Tiny model reached 98% accuracy.
These findings show the potential to implement ConvNeXt-based systems in regions with scarce healthcare facilities for effective and affordable malaria diagnosis.
AI coupled to pharmacometric modelling to tailor malaria and tuberculosis treatment in Africa  Africas vast genetic diversity poses challenges for optimising drug treatments in the continent, which is exacerbated by the fact that drug discovery and development efforts have historically been performed outside Africa.
This has led to suboptimal therapeutic outcomes in African populations and overall scarcity of relevant pharmacogenetic data, including characteristic genotypes as well as drugs prescribed in the continent to treat infectious diseases.
Here, we propose a general approach to identify drug-gene pairs with potential pharmacogenetic interest.
Furthermore, we delve deeper into the analysis of malaria and tuberculosis therapies, many of which remain uncharacterised from a pharmacogenetic perspective.
Our pipeline leverages artificial intelligence and the latest advances in knowledge embedding techniques to exploit currently available biomedical data and subsequently prioritise pharmacogenes for each drug.
Predicted pharmacogenes are then incorporated into pharmacometric modelling to hypothesise which ones might be of clinical interest, and which dose adjustments could be made to provide better treatment outcomes for the African population.
What incentives encourage local communities to collect and upload mosquito sound data by using smartphones?
A case study in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Malaria is one of the deadliest vector borne diseases effecting sub-Saharan Africa.
A suite of systems are being used to monitor and manage malaria risk and disease incidence, with an increasing focus on technological interventions that allow private citizens to remotely record and upload data.
Studies that aim to improve data collection quality and quantity have often included incentivisation, providing citizen scientists with monetary or other benefits for their participation in data collection.
We tested whether monetary incentives enhance participation and data collection in a study trialling an acoustic mosquito sensor.
The effect of incentives on data collection varied over the course of the trial, increasing participation in the start of the trial but with no effect in the latter half of the trial.
These results suggest that though there is an initial benefit, extrinsic motivations do not override differences in intrinsic motivations over time, and enhanced communication and dialogue with participants may improve citizen science participation and attitudes.

Performance characteristics and potential public health impact of improved pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccines targeting childhood burden  New malaria vaccine development builds on groundbreaking recommendations and roll-out of two approved pre-erythrocytic vaccines (PEVs); RTS,S/AS01 and R21/MM.
Whilst these vaccines are effective in reducing childhood malaria within yearly routine immunization programs or seasonal vaccination, there is little evidence on how different PEV efficacies, durations of protection, and spacing between doses influence the potential to avert uncomplicated and severe childhood malaria.
Mainly, lacking understanding of the required vaccine properties and delivery strategies that lead to an effective childhood vaccine with multi-year protection.
We used an individual-based model of malaria transmission informed by trial data to quantify trade-offs between PEV performance properties and impact across different endemicities, deployment schedules, and coverage levels.
We found that deploying a vaccine with 90% initial efficacy, with a six to 12-month half-life duration of protection, co-administered with a blood-stage drug, followed by yearly boosters, results in 60-80% yearly incidence reduction, consistent with seasonal RTS,S and R21 trials.
Halting vaccination after five years, leads to sustained protection of at least a 35% incidence reduction in children <six years in the 12 months following cessation in settings where PfPR2-10 <30%.
Increasing the half-life duration to 12 -18 months or reaching more children provides the same health impact with lower vaccine efficacy.
Without a booster (fourth dose), high efficacy (>90%) and longer half-life duration (>12 months) are required to sustain impact beyond primary vaccination, averting up to half the preceding years burden.
Overall, our findings support the need for well-defined target product profiles for long duration vaccines linking priority use cases of where, how, and to whom to deploy new malaria vaccines, to maximize public health impact.
Remoscope: a label-free imaging cytometer for malaria diagnostics  Malaria diagnostic testing in high transmission settings remains a burden on healthcare systems.
Here we present Remoscope, a portable automated imaging cytometer that scans fresh, unstained whole blood using a custom neural network on low-cost hardware.
By screening up to two million red blood cells, Remoscope performs label-free quantitative stage-specific detection of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) in 1-12 minutes without sample fixation, staining, or slide scanning.
Flow is used to achieve high cellular throughput, with blood confined to a 4.5 {micro}m monolayer in low-cost disposable flow cartridges.
Remoscope performance was benchmarked in vitro by titration of cultured parasites into uninfected whole blood at concentrations of 17.1-710,000 parasites/{micro}L. Counts generated by Remoscope demonstrated a linear response across the entire range.
Considering drug susceptibility assays, the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of chloroquine (CQ) for the W2 strain of Pf was 211 nM by Remoscope, compared to 191 nM for conventional flow cytometry.
Remoscopes real-world diagnostic accuracy was evaluated in a cohort of 500 individuals in eastern Uganda, comprising 601 unique clinic visits.
Parallel measurements of parasitemia were performed using Remoscope, qPCR targeting the multicopy conserved var gene acidic terminal sequence, and microscopic evaluation of Giemsa-stained thick blood smears.
Remoscopes limit of detection with respect to qPCR was 95.1 parasites/{micro}L. At this threshold, the system had a sensitivity of 83%, specificity of 96%, Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 91%, and a Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 93%.
Remoscopes speed, accuracy, low cost, and ease of use address practical challenges in malaria diagnostic settings around the world.
As a general imaging flow cytometer, Remoscope may also inform the development of recognition models for the diagnosis of other infectious and noninfectious blood disorders.
Humanization of Care: A Geospatial Analysis of Key Indicators of Quality and Safety of Health Care and Service in the Centre Region, Cameroon.
BackgroundIntegrating the principles of humanized care into healthcare systems is critical to promoting optimal well-being throughout the patient care process.
In a context of limited resources, improving the quality of care and health services means identifying priority sites to optimize cost-effectiveness.
The objective was to measure key indicators of quality and safety of care in health facilities (HFs) and to map priority health districts (HDs) for effective implementation of high-impact interventions in the Centre Region.
MethodsWe conducted a descriptive cross-sectional analysis using retrospective data from 2018 to 2022 from 32 HDs comprising the Centre Region were extracted in April 2023.
Data were retrieved from the national database using DHIS 2 and checked for completeness.
The health indicators assessed were those defined in the Cameroon Health Sector Strategy for 2020-2030.
ResultsThe density of the qualified HCWs was 13.7 per 10 000 inhabitants in 2022.
The density of doctors in rural areas has fallen sharply over the five-year study period, with a decline of almost 20% by 2020 in favor of urban areas.
The Odza HD had the highest inpatient mortality rate over the five-year study period (49%).
In rural areas, the Esse HD had the highest mortality rate (32.4%).
Esse (18.8%) and Odza (6.7%) HDs had the highest perioperative mortality rates in rural and urban areas, respectively.
Most of the urban HDs (5/8=62.5%) had a neonatal mortality rate higher than the regional median (RM=3.1).
Half of the rural HDs had a maternal mortality ratio higher than the regional median (RM=118 per 1000 live births).
The HDs of Mbandjock (357/1,000) and Mvog-Ada (285/1,000) were the most affected in rural and urban areas respectively.
More than two thirds of urban HDs recorded a proportion of free malaria treatment cases below the regional median (14%).
ConclusionsEfforts to humanize healthcare in the Centre Region are hindered by persistent disparities in care quality and inconsistent policy implementation.
Sustainable Development Goals and Health Sector Strategic Indicators Assessment in Cameroon: A Retrospective Analysis at Regional and National Levels  BackgroundCameroon has developed a Health Sector Strategy (HSS) that aims at fostering a healthy and productive human capital.
To achieve this objective, key health indicators have been defined to track progress towards the goal.
This study was conducted to provide evidence on the current situation and assess progress towards achieving the HSS and other key health indicators in the Centre Region and in Cameroon.
MethodsData were collected in April 2023 through a through a comprehensive review of online documents and databases.
Data were retrieved from the national database using DHIS2 version 2.40 and checked for completeness.
ResultsAt national level, the highest performance was observed in the proportion of HIV-positive pregnant women receiving ART (99%), while the lowest performance was observed in the reduction of the prevalence of chronic malnutrition among children under five, with 63% of the target achieved.
In the Centre Region, the national target of reducing the prevalence of chronic malnutrition to 11% was achieved.
The lowest performance was observed in the proportion of children under five sleeping under long-lasting insecticidal nets.
The density of health facilities was above target at national level (2.3 per 10,000 population) but below target at regional level (1.4 per 10,000 population).
Coverage of tracer antigens (Penta 3, BCG) decreased over the five-year study period, falling below the national target of 95% in 2022.
However, coverage remained above the national average throughout the study period.
Coverage of pregnant women attending four or more antenatal clinics and receiving at least three doses of intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) remained low from 2018 to 2022.
Nevertheless, further efforts are required to prevent malaria transmission, promote antenatal care utilization among pregnant women, and address nutritional insecurity in certain Regions.
Different predictors of message fatigue across diverse risk areas for dengue prevention in Taiwan  BackgroundDifferent regions in Taiwan have varying levels of dengue risk; however, the same prevention messages were implemented nationwide for a prolonged period.
Individuals experiencing high levels of message fatigue may engage in fewer preventive activities.
Although message fatigue has been studied concerning many infectious diseases, it has not been extensively researched in the context of dengue.
Moreover, previous studies primarily focused on the general population regardless of risk level or on high-risk populations, with few examining message fatigue across areas with varying risk levels.
Therefore, this study aimed to identify distinct predictors of message fatigue across different dengue-risk areas in Taiwan.
Methodology/Principal FindingsThe online questionnaire was adapted from the measurement developed by So et al., based on the conceptual definition of message fatigue.
Message fatigue has two dimensions: message environment (ME) and audience response (AR).
A negative binomial model was used to examine the association between the demographic variables (sex, residency, education, occupation, age, and income) and the perceived variables (perceived prevalence, perceived severity, and optimistic bias) with ME and AR separately.
The results showed that in high dengue-risk areas, individuals with an education level of high school or below reported significantly higher levels of AR compared to those educated higher than high school (1.10, 95% CI = 1.01-1.21).
In medium dengue-risk areas, individuals in the optimism group were 1.12 times more likely (95% CI = 1.01- 1.25) to report higher levels of ME than those in the realistic group.
In low dengue-risk areas, younger individuals, males, and those with a high-school education or below reported significantly higher levels of AR.
Conclusions/SignificanceThis study revealed that dengue-message fatigue is associated with different variables across varying risk areas.
Author summaryIn Taiwan, dengue is a significant public health concern, and different regions face varying levels of risk.
Despite these differences, the same public health messages about dengue prevention are disseminated nationwide.
In this study, we explored how people in areas with high, medium, and low risk of dengue of Taiwan respond to these messages, specifically focusing on message fatigue--when individuals tire of repeated health messages and may stop following preventive advice.
We found that individuals in high-risk areas with lower education levels reported more fatigue with these messages, while those in medium-risk areas who were optimistic about the disease were more likely to experience fatigue.
In low-risk areas, younger individuals, males, and those with lower education levels were more likely to experience message fatigue.
These findings can help global health authorities design better-targeted public health messages by considering how different groups respond to repeated health messaging, thereby making dengue prevention efforts more effective across various risk areas.
Gaussian Process Emulation for Modeling Dengue Outbreak Dynamics  Epidemiological models that aim for a high degree of biological realism by simulating every individual in a population are unavoidably complex, with many free parameters, which makes systematic explorations of their dynamics computationally challenging.
To simulate disease dynamics, we developed an individual-based model of dengue transmission that includes factors such as social structure, seasonality, and variation in human movement.
We trained three Gaussian Process surrogate models on three outcomes: outbreak probability, maximum incidence, and epidemic duration.
Our analysis revealed that average infectivity and average human mobility are key drivers of these epidemiological metrics, while the seasonal timing of the first infection can influence the course of the epidemic outbreak.
We use a dataset comprising more than 1,000 dengue epidemics observed over 12 years in Colombia to calibrate our Gaussian Process model and evaluate its predictive power.
The calibrated Gaussian Process model identifies a subset of municipalities with consistently higher average infectivity estimates, highlighting them as promising areas for targeted public health interventions.
Overall, this work underscores the potential of Gaussian Process emulation to enable the use of more complex individual-based models in epidemiology, allowing a higher degree of realism and accuracy that should increase our ability to control important diseases such as dengue.
Caregivers Decision to Report Adverse Drug Reactions among Children Receiving Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention in Ghana  IntroductionThe antimalarial medicines used in Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) campaigns are generally well-tolerated but adverse drug reactions (ADRs) can occur.
Monitoring, reporting, and prompt management of ADRs is essential to build and maintain trust in SMC campaigns in the implementing communities.
The caregivers decision to report ADRs represents a critical issue at the intersection of public health, child welfare, and pharmacovigilance.
As SMC campaigns continue to expand, it is imperative to understand and address the factors influencing caregivers decisions to report ADRs.
MethodsA mixed methods cross-sectional study involving questionnaire administration, focus group discussions, and review of childrens health records was employed to collect data from caregivers of children aged 3-59 months in the Northern, North-East, and Savanna regions of Ghana.
A systematic random sample of 679 caregivers was recruited for the study across three regions.
Data including ADR occurrence, maternal and child characteristics was collected from selected caregivers in their homes.
Logistic regression was performed for associations between caregivers reports of ADRs and caregiver characteristics.
ResultsAbout 49.5% (336/679) of caregivers mentioned the occurrence of ADRs in children after receiving SMC medication.
The commonly cited ADR was diarrhea (34.7%, 116/336).
Only 16.9% (57/336) of caregivers reported ADRs to the health workers at the time of occurrence.
After adjusting for confounders, increasing age of child (aOR=1.04, 95%CI:1.008-1.065), receiving education on ADR reporting (aOR=4.03, 95%CI:4.366-6.119), education on management of mild ADRs (aOR=4.43, 95%CI:2.094-9.808) and having a means of reaching health personnel (aOR=1.56, 95%CI:1.202-2.037) increased the odds of ADR reporting while increasing age of caregivers (aOR=0.92, 95%CI:0.883-0.966) and being married (aOR=0.17, 95%CI:0.149-0.183) decreased the odds of reporting ADRs among the caregivers studied.
ConclusionLess than 20% of caregivers whose children experienced ADRs after receiving SMC medication reported the incident.
Caregiver education on ADRs and its management and means of reaching the health team were modifiable factors that influenced caregiver ADR reporting.
The relationship between expelled eggs, morbidity and age: Implications for current Schistosoma mansoni elimination policies  Direct morbidity assessments are rarely included in monitoring and evaluation of Schistosoma mansoni control programmes.
Instead, the number of eggs-per-gram (EPG) of faeces is used as a proxy for morbidity.
The World Health Organization targets schistosomiasis elimination as a public health problem (EPHP) by 2030, defined as <1% heavy infections ([&ge;]400 EPG for intestinal schistosomiasis).
However, recent findings challenge this link between infection intensity and morbidity.
Prevalence and intensities of S. mansoni infection were diagnosed by Kato-Katz and point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen tests in 287 individuals, 3-74 years-old, from Bugoto, Uganda.
Ultrasound examinations following the Niamey protocol characterised metrics of morbidity: periportal fibrosis (PPF), portal vein dilation (PVD) and left parasternal line (PSL) enlargement.
Additional morbidity markers included anaemia and self-reported symptoms.
Malaria status was determined using rapid diagnostic testing.
Logistic regression models elucidated potential predictors of morbidity.
PPF, PVD, PSL and anaemia prevalence were 9%, 34%, 33% and 13% respectively.
School-aged children (SAC) had the highest infection intensity, but pre-school-aged children (PSAC) were significantly more likely to have PVD, PSL and anaemia than other age groups.
Current S. mansoni infection predicted only self-reported symptoms of blood in stool and rash.
As infection intensity increased, so did the likelihood of anaemia and fibrosis, but this was significant only at levels much higher than the 400 EPG threshold.
Current malaria infection, measured with rapid diagnostic testing, was associated with PVD and anaemia.
Our findings add to growing evidence against using [&ge;]400 EPG as a proxy for schistosomiasis morbidity within control programs, urging a revaluation of targets.
The age-related distribution of morbidities observed, with a notable burden in PSAC, highlights a critical need to elucidate the impact of less-specific morbidities on host health and its interplay with current and past infections with S. mansoni and other parasites.
Author SummarySchistosomiasis is a parasitic disease that affects millions of people worldwide, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.
Monitoring and control programs typically rely on counting parasite eggs in stool as a proxy to measure disease severity, but recent evidence questions whether this method accurately reflects the real health impact of the disease.
Here we examined 287 individuals in Bugoto, Uganda, aged 3 to 74, using both stool and blood tests to detect Schistosoma mansoniinfection.
We also used ultrasound to assess liver damage and other health complications caused by the parasite and used rapid testing of participants blood to diagnose malaria.
Surprisingly, we found that even at very low S. mansoni infection levels, young children had significant liver-related complications and anaemia.
We also found that only very high egg counts were associated with severe health problems such as liver fibrosis.
Additionally, current malaria infection was strongly linked to anaemia and liver abnormalities, complicating the picture further.
Our findings suggest that the current World Health Organization thresholds for defining disease severity does not provide an accurate picture of the true burden of schistosomiasis, particularly in young children and in regions of co-endemicity with malaria.
Entomological surveillance during a major CHIKV outbreak in northwestern Sao Paulo: insights from Sao Jose do Rio Preto  BackgroundBrazil is considered an epicenter for emerging and re-emerging arboviruses that significantly impact public health.
The mid-sized city of Sao Jose do Rio Preto (SJdRP) in northwestern Sao Paulo state is considered hyperendemic for arboviral diseases, with case numbers climbing each year.
Only 45 cases of chikungunya (CHIKV) were reported in the city from 2015 to 2022, indicating cryptic circulation of this virus, but cases in the state increased notably in 2023.
This study investigates the use of active entomological surveillance to detect new arbovirus introductions in specific areas like SJdRP.
Methodology/Principal findingsWe used molecular testing to investigate the presence of CHIKV in adult culicids collected monthly from various neighborhoods in SJdRP.
Positive samples underwent whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.
Entomological surveillance successfully detected the early spread of CHIKV across SJdRP, revealing an infection rate of 6.67%, with the well-established vectors Aedes aegypti and Ae.
albopictus as well as Culex sp.
The vector positivity rate increased from December 2023 to April 2024, which correlates with rising numbers of chikungunya fever cases reported in SJdRP during the same period.
The resurgence of CHIKV in this region is attributed to several introduction events, mainly from the Southeast and North of Brazil, which facilitated establishment of the virus within the highly dense vector population and led to extensive spread and, in turn, a major CHIKV epidemic in this geographical area.
Conclusions/significanceExtensive circulation of CHIKV was documented within the human and vector population, marking the onset of the first major CHIKV epidemic in SJdRP and neighboring cities.
Because multiple arboviruses co-circulate in several locations in Brazil, entomological surveillance, along with ongoing monitoring of patient samples, is a key to help health authorities to implement more effective measures to interrupt transmission cycles and mitigate new epidemic waves.
Author summaryThe city of Sao Jose do Rio Preto (SJdRP) in northwestern Sao Paulo state is an endemic area for dengue virus (DENV), but cases of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) were also reported between January and September 2023.
Since overlapping symptoms between these acute febrile diseases can complicate differential diagnosis, the increase in CHIKV cases in DENV-endemic regions is concerning.
Entomological surveillance is a useful strategy for accurate and early detection of arboviruses, making it possible to identify emerging or increased arbovirus activity, predict potential outbreaks, and support effective control measures, thus reducing impacts on public health.
Through entomological surveillance we were able to detect the spread of CHIKV in SJdRP, revealing a high infection rate in the vector population.
Our findings also suggest that the virus spread widely throughout the local mosquito population, potentially via vertical or sexual transmission, which may have contributed to sustained transmission during unfavorable conditions or inter-epidemic periods.
We also observed a monthly increase in the vector populations positivity rate which correlates with a rise in CHIKV cases in the city and the first CHIKV outbreak in this area.
Oropouche Virus Outbreak in Southeast, Brazil: Expanding Beyond the Amazonian Endemic Region  The Oropouche virus (OROV), historically endemic to the Amazon, has spread to nearly all Brazilian states in 2024, with Espirito Santo emerging as a significant transmission hotspot in the Atlantic Forest biome.
We characterized the epidemiological factors driving OROV spread in non-endemic Southeast Brazil, analyzing environmental and agricultural conditions contributing to viral transmission.
Samples from 29,000 suspected arbovirus-infected patients were tested by RT-qPCR for Dengue, Chikungunya, Zika, Mayaro, and Oropouche virus.
Between March and June 2024, OROV cases in the state reached 339, demonstrating successful local transmission.
Spatial analysis revealed that most cases clustered in municipalities with tropical climates and intensive cacao, robusta coffee, coconut, and pepper cultivation.
Phylogenetic analysis identified the Espirito Santo OROV strains as part of the 2022-2024 Amazonian lineage.
The rapid spread of OROV outside the Amazon highlights its adaptive potential and public health threat, emphasizing the need for enhanced surveillance and targeted control measures.
Trends and Cross-Country Inequalities in Dengue, 1990-2021  BackgroundThe existing body of literature is deficient in the most recent data regarding the global perspective of dengue fever and its associated health inequities.Our aim is to assess the global burden of dengue fever and its health inequities from 1990 to 2021.
MethodsWe utilized the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database for epidemiological trends, demographic analysis, and epidemiological decomposition.
Cross-national inequality and predictive modeling for the global dengue burden up to 2051 were also performed.
ResultsGlobally, dengue fever incidence, prevalence, DALYs, and mortality showed increasing trends with significant international disparities.
From 1990 to 2021, ASR for incidence and prevalence rose by 1.83% (95% CI: 1.58%-2.08%), and for DALYs and mortality by 1.33% (95% CI: 1.10%-1.57%) and 1.70% (95% CI: 1.45%-1.94%), respectively.
Age-period-cohort-model analysis revealed a positive correlation between dengue fever incidence and age, with mortality sharply increasing in those over 80.
Decomposition of dengue fever DALYs burden showed population growth as the main contributor to the global burden, with varying impacts across SDI quintiles.
Inequalities in dengue fever burden related to SDI persisted, shifting benefits from impoverished to affluent populations.
BAPC model projections suggest stabilization of incidence and prevalence ASRs, with declining DALYs and mortality ASRs, particularly for females.
ConclusionThis study elucidates the changes in the burden of dengue fever against the backdrop of a burgeoning global population, severe aging, and pronounced health inequities across nations, quantifying these alterations and forecasting the trends in the disease burden over the next three decades.
Concurrently, the research proposes effective measures for various countries and regions to mitigate health inequities associated with dengue fever and to reduce the associated disease burden.
Re-evaluating malarial retinopathy to improve its diagnostic accuracy in cerebral malaria  BackgroundPrevious work has identified that malarial retinopathy (MR) has diagnostic value in cerebral malaria (CM).
To improve our understanding of MR as a predictor of cerebral parasite sequestration in CM we reviewed data from the Blantyre autopsy study.
MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of data collected from a consecutive series of patients presenting to the Pediatric Research Ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi between 1996 and 2010.
We determined the diagnostic accuracy of MR as a predictor of cerebral parasite sequestration in a cohort of children with fatal CM.
ResultsOf 84 children included in the study, 65 met the WHO criteria for CM during life.
Eighteen (28%) of 65 did not have evidence of cerebral parasite sequestration at autopsy and 17 had an alternative cause of death.
MR had a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 73% to predict sequestration.
In a subset of patients with graded retinal assessments, this was improved to 94% and 88% by reclassifying patients with 1-5 hemorrhages in only one eye as retinopathy negative.
ConclusionsMR remains the most specific point-of-care test for CM in endemic areas.
Its specificity can be improved, without sacrificing sensitivity, by reclassifying patients with less than 5 hemorrhages in one eye only as MR negative.
Systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis on glucose- 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase activities measured by a semi-quantitative handheld Biosensor  Measurement of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity guides hypnozoitocidal treatment of P. vivax malaria.
The G6PD Standard (SDBiosensor, Republic of Korea) here referred to as "Biosensor" is a quantitative point-of-care diagnostic that measures G6PD activity in U/gHb .
The manufacturer recommends cutoffs to define G6PD deficient ([&le;]4.0U/gHb), intermediate (4.1-[&le;]6.0U/gHb) and normal (>6.0U/gHb) individuals.
A systematic review identified studies reporting population-level G6PD activity measured by Biosensor, published between January 2017 and May 2023.
IPD were collated and standardised.
The adjusted male median (AMM) was defined as 100% activity and calculated across all studies (universal AMM) and separately for each setting.
The proportion of participants classified as deficient or intermediate were compared using the manufacturer-recommended cutoffs and 30% and 70% of the universal AMM and setting-specific AMM.
Associations between G6PD activity and blood sampling method, malaria status, and age were assessed.
Eleven studies with 9,724 participants from eight countries were included in this analysis.
The universal AMM was 7.7U/gHb and the setting-specific AMMs ranged from 6.2U/gHb to 9.9U/gHb.
When using the universal AMM, 4.2% of participants were classified as deficient and 11.9% as intermediate or deficient.
The corresponding values were 3.9% and 10.8% for setting-specific cutoffs, and 7.2% and 18.3% for manufacturer-recommended definitions for deficients and intermediates respectively.
The manufacturer-recommended cutoff for deficient individuals fitted the distribution of G6PD activities better than definitions based on the percentage of AMM.
There was no significant association between malaria status or blood sampling method and G6PD activity.
Measured G6PD activity decreased in children 1 to 5 years and plateaued thereafter.
The manufacturers recommended cutoff is conservative but more reliable at categorising G6PD deficient individuals than those based on calculations of 30% activity using the AMM.
The observed decrease in G6PD activity in children between 1 to 5 years of age warrants further investigation.
Per vaginal bleeding-an important but ignored feature of dengue  BackgroundElderly individuals, those with comorbidities and pregnant women are at a higher risk of developing severe dengue and succumbing to their illness.
However, an increased incidence of severe dengue and fatalities are seen in females of the reproductive age.
As per vaginal (PV) bleeding is an important complication that has not been well characterized, we sought to determine the frequency, complications and disease outcomes in women who develop PV bleeding.
Methodology/Principal findings288 adult female patients were recruited from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases Sri Lanka.
All clinical features and laboratory investigations were recorded throughout the duration of hospital admission along with treatment received.
28/288 (9.72%) reported PV bleeding, with 12/28 (42.85%) developing dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) compared to 65/260 (25%) of those who did not have bleeding.
Women who developed PV bleeding were more likely to have developed DHF (OR 2.2, 95% CI 0.98 to 5.1, p=0.06), abdominal pain (OR=2.17, 95% CI = 0.99 to 4.69, p = 0.06), vomiting (OR= 2.0, 95% CI= 0.89 to 4.44, p= 0.10), diarhoea (OR= 4.35, 95% CI = 1.908 to 9.610, p= 0.0004) or evidence of any fluid leakage (OR= 1.98, 95% CI = 0.91 to 4.5, p = 0.11).
Although not significant, those who had PV bleeding were more likely to have been given intravenous fluids, blood transfusions and colloids.
ConclusionsPV bleeding appears to associate with worse disease outcomes.
The possible contribution of PV bleeding to higher incidence of severe dengue and fatality rates observed in many countries, should be further investigated.
Author summaryElderly individuals, those with comorbidities and pregnant women are at a higher risk of developing severe dengue and succumbing to their illness.
However, an increased incidence of severe dengue and fatalities are seen in females of the reproductive age.
As per vaginal (PV) bleeding is an important complication that has not been well characterized, we investigated the complications and disease outcomes in women who developed PV bleeding, by studying clinical and laboratory characteristics of 288 women with acute dengue.
28 (9.72%) reported PV bleeding, with 42.85% developing dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF).
Women who developed PV bleeding were more likely to have developed DHF, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarhoea or evidence of any fluid leakage.
They were more likely to have been given intravenous fluids, blood transfusions and colloids.
Therefore, the possible contribution of PV bleeding to higher incidence of severe dengue and fatality rates in many countries should be further investigated.
Community Engagement in Dengue Interventions in Conflict- affected Aden, Yemen: An Implementation Research Using CFIR Framework 2.0.
Dengue fever is described by the World Health Organization (WHO) as "the most important mosquito-borne viral disease in the world."
In Yemen, dengue cases have consistently increased, with Aden Governorate reporting 12% of total cases and over 45% of dengue-related deaths, making it a leading public health challenge.
Community engagement (CE) emerges as a critical approach to address these challenges.
This study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to CE in dengue interventions within conflict-affected contexts and recommend evidence-based strategies for improved implementation.
A cross-sectional qualitative study was conducted between February and July 2024 in Aden Governorate, involving 15 in-depth interviews (IDIs) and four focus group discussions (FGDs) with key stakeholders.
Findings revealed that while stakeholders perceived CE interventions positively, challenges included systemic issues such as lack of community trust, resource shortages, and health system politicization.
In conclusion, addressing systemic fragmentation, enhancing political support, and defining clear coordination plans are critical to adapting CE interventions effectively in conflict  Author SummaryDengue fever is considered a major health problem for many low-and middle-income countries, leading to high numbers of mortality and morbidity rates with a significant economic burden.
Our study highlights the intersection of public health challenges and conflict dynamics, providing unique insights into how community engagement strategies for vector-borne diseases can be adapted to conflict settings.
Impact of Donor History on the Risk of Transfusion-Related Infections  BackgroundTransfusion-related infections are a severe threat to the safety of transfusing blood products, internationally.
Advances in screening procedures have not, nevertheless, rendered blood transfusion a risk-free procedure for transmitting infectious disease.
MethodsThe cross-sectional study was done in January 2022 to December 2023 at KTRH.
Out of 108 blood transfusions, data for 108 patients were retrieved from patient medical records and donor screening forms.
Variables such as HIV and Hepatitis among donor medical conditions, previous donation history, and high-risk behaviors such as intravenous drug use were analyzed for their link with TRIs.
The diagnosis of TRIs was established based on the results of a clinical examination and laboratory tests.
Using descriptive statistics as well as Chi-square tests and logistic regression, data were analyzed.
ResultsOf the total transfusion sample (n=108), 15 (13.9%) recipients developed infections after transfusion; in these cases, 4.6% had Hepatitis B infections, whereas 3.7% had HIV infections and 5.6% had malaria infections.
Past donor experience and risky behavior, which include intravenous drug uses and other risky sexual practices, show a significant association between the increased risk of TRIs (p < 0.05).
The odds of transfusion-transmitted infections among repeat donors as compared to first-time donors were marginally high (p=0.04).
These independent risk factors for transfusion-related infections were hepatitis B and HIV.
Improved donor screening protocols and monitoring of high-risk behaviors can further enhance safety in blood transfusion.
Investigating the Role of Vitamin D in the Prevention and Control of Dengue Virus Vectors and Related Diseases: A Systematic Review Study  IntroductionDengue fever is one of the most common vector-borne diseases in the world, affecting many people annually and causing many deaths.
In recent years, attention has been paid to the role of micronutrients, including vitamin D, in the control and treatment of viral diseases, including dengue fever.
Accordingly, this study aimed to investigate the role of vitamin D in the treatment and control of dengue fever worldwide using a systematic review method.
MethodsThis study was conducted as a systematic review of the role of vitamin D in the prevention and control of dengue fever globally using a systematic review method.
ResultsSix articles published between 2018 and 2023 were included in the systematic review process.
According to the findings, vitamin D affects macrophages that are differentiated from monocytes and increases resistance to dengue virus.
Vitamin D also reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines, transcription, and reduction of mRNA receptors, increases the production of interleukins, especially IL-10, and plays a role in reducing viral load, severity of clinical symptoms, and infection control.
ConclusionVitamin D3 can control the disease and decrease viral load and the severity of dengue fever in patients by inhibiting the inflammatory response and enhancing the immune response.
Combining seasonal malaria chemoprevention with novel therapeutics for malaria prevention: a mathematical modelling study  BackgroundVaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and long-acting injectables are being developed to prevent Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
MethodsWe used an individual-based malaria transmission model to estimate the health impact of combining new therapeutics with seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC).
Our modelling framework used emulator-based methods with models of pre-liver and blood stage therapeutic dynamics.
We evaluated the benefit of combining therapeutics with SMC in children under five by estimating reductions in the cumulative incidence of uncomplicated and severe malaria, relative to SMC or the new therapeutic alone, during and five years after deployment.
ResultsNew therapeutics may require extended pre-liver stage duration or multi-stage activity to combine with SMC.
For three SMC cycles in a high transmission setting, a pre-liver stage therapeutic with partial initial efficacy (>50%) required a protection half-life >230 days to reduce cumulative severe cases by >5% five years after deployment stopped (>23% during interventions).
Longer protection was needed when combined with four or five SMC cycles.
Combining SMC with a multi-stage therapeutic increased public health impact both during and after deployment.
ConclusionsCombining SMC with malaria therapeutics active against multiple stages of the parasite life cycle can improve the effectiveness of SMC, highlighting the need to prioritise the clinical development of these therapeutics for combination with malaria chemoprevention.
The MARC SE-Africa Dashboard: Joining Forces to Counteract Emerging Antimalarial Resistance in South and East Africa  Regions within eastern and southern Africa (SE-Africa) carry some of the highest malaria burdens.
Understanding the spatiotemporal changes in the emergence and spread of artemisinin (partial) resistance (ART-R) and how to mitigate ART-R is therefore of paramount importance in these areas.
Here, we present a dashboard developed by the Mitigating Antimalarial Resistance Consortium for SE-Africa in collaboration with nineteen national control malaria programs (NCMPs) and their partners.
The dashboard supports NCMPs decision-making by providing curated information on the latest antimalarial resistance data available.
We systematically reviewed, collated, and visualized antimalarial resistance information from therapeutic efficacy studies, molecular surveillance for Pfkelch13 ART-R genetic markers, current in-country malaria treatment policies, and reported malaria cases and deaths.
Five countries, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, reported artemether-lumefantrine treatment failures above the WHO threshold of 10% after correcting for reinfections.
The A675V, R561H, P574L, and C469F Pfkelch13 markers were highly prevalent in cross-border regions of several East African countries, with the C469Y marker rapidly spreading across Uganda.
Author SummaryWe introduce the MARC SE-Africa Dashboard, an innovative tool developed at the request of national malaria control programs to enhance the management of malaria through data-driven insights into antimalarial drug resistance in Southern and Eastern Africa.
This allows health professionals, researchers, and policymakers to target interventions effectively and adapt strategies in response to the evolving landscape of malaria resistance.
The information visualized on the dashboard includes updated information on molecular markers of resistance, therapeutic efficacy outcomes, and national treatment policies for 19 malaria-endemic countries.
The dashboard aims to facilitate regional cooperation in malaria management, which proves essential for proactive combat against malaria in high-risk areas.
We discuss the insights gained from the curated and collated data and the manner in which this data and dashboard can support national malaria control programs and researchers.
Assessing mosquito dynamics and dengue transmission in Foz do Iguacu, Brazil through an enhanced temperature-dependent mathematical model  Dengue fever is a public health concern that demands efforts to mitigate its impact.
We aim to investigate the influence of key parameters temperature-dependent on dengue transmission dynamics in Foz do Iguacu, a triple border municipality in south Brazil, applying a mathematical model composed by systems of ordinary differential equations.
Adjusted model simulation is consistent with the observed data.
The effective reproduction number was calculated for detecting changes in dengue transmission over time and to timely detect the beginning of epidemics.
Additionally, we explore the potential effects of climate variability on dengue dynamics.
Our findings show the importance of vector population dynamics, climate and incidence, contributing to a deeper understanding of dengue transmission dynamics in Foz do Iguacu and providing a foundation for optimizing intervention strategies, also, in other cities, enhancing our ability to predict and manage dengue outbreaks and supporting public health efforts to control measures.
Estimating malaria antigen dynamics and the time to negativity of next-generation malaria rapid diagnostic tests  BackgroundRapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) used to diagnose Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) predominantly target the antigen Histidine Rich Protein 2 (HRP2) exclusively.
With the emergence of hrp2/hrp3 gene deletions, RDTs targeting other antigens such as the essential enzyme Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) are needed.
The dynamics of LDH relative to HRP2 are currently not well described but are needed to inform the use of next-generation (NG-) LDH and HRP2 RDTs that are designed to address hrp2/hrp3 gene deletions.
MethodsA longitudinal cohort study conducted in a low transmission setting in Namibia was leveraged to compare HRP2 and LDH decay rates.
Passive and active case detection were used to recruit individuals with positive HRP2-RDT results.
Study participants were treated and subsequently followed weekly until they received two consecutive HRP2-RDT negative results.
Blood specimens were characterized for antigen concentration and parasite density.
Antigen decay rates were calculated and used to estimate time to negativity (TTN) of NG-RDTs: two HRP2 and LDH-based RDTs (Rapigen Pf and a WHO prequalified Pf/Pv RDT) and an LDH-only RDT (Rapigen Pf/Pv).
ResultsIn 135 participants, the starting geometric mean concentrations for HRP2 and LDH were 899 ng/mL and 344 ng/mL respectively.
Both antigens followed a biphasic decay rate, with a faster decay rate in the first phase.
For current RDTs with an analytical sensitivity of 1 ng/mL for HRP2 and 5 ng/mL for LDH, TTN was 44 and 4 days, respectively.
With a NG-RDT with LDH analytical sensitivity of 0.37 ng/mL, average TTN was 9 days.
Multiple levels of analytical sensitivity were also modeled.
ConclusionsIn the detection of Pf malaria, LDH versus HRP2-based RDTs had a faster TTN due to a combination of lower accumulated antigen concentrations and faster decay rates, even for more sensitive LDH-based RDTs.
Detection of LDH versus HRP2 by RDT is more likely to reflect a new or very recent infection.
For NG-RDTs that target both antigens, HRP2 is likely to contribute more to the test signal than LDH in recently treated infections unless the infection has hrp2/hrp3 gene deletions.
Antigen decay data combined with analytical sensitivity of RDTs contributes to our understanding of their performance and interpretation.
Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the uptake of intermittent sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine for prevention of malaria amongst pregnant women in Sierra Leone  BackgroundMalaria in pregnancy contributes to high maternal mortality, warranting the adoption of intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) of malaria in pregnancy in Sierra Leone in 2017.
Since then, the uptake of IPTp has increased but it is unclear whether COVID-19 has any impact on these services.
We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the uptake of IPTp among pregnant women in Sierra leone at district, regional, and national levels.
MethodsA retrospective cross-sectional study design was used to assess the monthly aggregated data from DHIS2 for all 5 regions of Sierra Leone.
The median and interquartile range for each outcome in each period were calculated.
ResultsThe median monthly uptake of total IPTp was the lowest before COVID (53,244) but increased during COVID-19 (55,257) and after COVID-19 (59,439).
IPTp1 uptake was lowest during COVID-19 (20,338) but highest after COVID-19 (20,914).
All three variables (IPTp1, IPTp2 and IPTp3) showed a clear decline in uptake in early 2020 and recovered within 3 months in a similar pattern of magnitude, except in Eastern Sierra Leone.
Both IPTp2 and IPTp3 showed more pronounced increases in uptake after recovery than IPTp1 and they both experienced sustained increases in the post-COVID-19 period.
ConclusionThe negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in reducing IPTp uptake was followed by rapid recovery, underscoring the resilience of the Sierra Leones health system in response to public health emergencies.
However, the delay in recovery in the IPTp uptake in the Eastern Sierra Leone highlight the need for strong differentiated regional strategies in protecting essential health services during public health emergencies.
Probabilistic classification of late treatment failure in uncomplicated malaria  Distinguishing treatment failure (recrudescence) from reinfection in uncomplicated falciparum malaria is essential for characterising antimalarial treatment efficacy in malaria endemic areas.
Classification of recrudescence versus reinfection is usually based on a comparison of parasite allelic calls derived from PCR amplification and electrophoresis of individual polymorphic markers in the acute and recurrent isolates.
Match-counting methods (e.g.
3/3 or 2/3 matching alleles) have usually been applied, but these do not account for multiple comparisons per-marker when infections are polyclonal.
We show that when infections are polyclonal, as is common in high transmission settings, currently used match-counting and model-based methods have unacceptably high false-discovery rates leading to overestimation of treatment failure.
We develop the software PfRecur which provides analytical Bayesian posterior probabilities of treatment failure in recurrent falciparum malaria.
We use data from a recent study in Angola to demonstrate the potential utility of our model in resolving complex polyclonal P. falciparum infections, thereby providing more accurate estimation of treatment failure rates.
Structured simulation-based training with frugal ophthalmic instruments rapidly equips non-ophthalmologists to identify malarial retinopathy  BackgroundMalaria, particularly cerebral malaria, poses a significant health threat, especially for children in sub-Saharan Africa.
Identification of malarial retinopathy (MR) has diagnostic value in cerebral malaria but can be impractical due to lack of availability of trained and equipped ophthalmic specialists.
Recent developments in low-cost simulation tools and ophthalmoscopes offer the potential to train non-ophthalmologists to offer fundus assessments in low-resource settings.
MethodsTwenty non-ophthalmologist healthcare providers in Malawi attended a training program focused on identification of MR using direct and binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy.
The curriculum included didactic sessions, hands-on practice with simulation eyes, and assessment of skill acquisition with immediate feedback.
Pre- and post-training confidence surveys were conducted.
ResultsParticipants demonstrated significant improvement in identification of malarial retinopathy after completing the training, with a mean accuracy of 83%.
Clinician confidence levels increased across all domains of retinal examination covered in the course.
ConclusionStructured simulation-based training using frugal ophthalmoscopes can equip non-ophthalmologists with skills to identify MR in simulation eyes.
A Cross-Sectional Study on Attitudes Toward Dengue Prevention Among Adults aged 18 and above Living in Korail Slum, Dhaka, Bangladesh.
Dengue fever poses a significant public health challenge in urban slums, where environmental and socio-economic vulnerabilities amplify risks.
This cross-sectional study investigates attitudes toward dengue prevention among 424 adults residing in Korail, a densely populated slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and analyzed to explore demographic, geographic, and socio-economic factors shaping preventive attitudes.
Equilibrium properties of a coupled contagion model of mosquito-borne disease and mosquito preventive behaviors  Although different strategies for mosquito-borne disease prevention can vary significantly in their efficacy and scale of implementation, they all require that individuals comply with their use.
Here, we sought to address that gap by establishing general expectations for how different behavioral stimuli and forms of mosquito prevention shape the equilibrium prevalence of disease.
To accomplish this, we developed a coupled contagion model tailored to the epidemiology of dengue and preventive behaviors relevant to it.
In contrast, encounters with individuals experiencing disease or engaging in preventive behaviors themselves had a smaller influence on behavior uptake.
The relative influence of these three stimuli reflected the relative frequency with which individuals encountered them.
We also found that two distinct forms of mosquito prevention--namely, personal protection and mosquito density reduction--mediated different influences of behavior on equilibrium disease prevalence.
Our results highlight that unique features of coupled contagion models can arise in disease systems with distinct biological features.
An experimental model of clinical immunity for human malaria  Clinical immunity to malaria can reduce fever and lead to asymptomatic infection but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
To examine the development of clinical immunity, we conducted a multi-cohort, repeat controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) study with Plasmodium vivax, and a heterologous rechallenge with P. falciparum.
Malaria-naive adults underwent P. vivax CHMI up to three times, at an interval of 5 to 20 months, by administration of red blood cells infected with the P. vivax PvW1 clone.

Malaria-naive adults underwent P. vivax CHMI up to three times, at an interval of 5 to 20 months, by administration of red blood cells infected with the P. vivax PvW1 clone.
In the final cohort of the study, a subset of participants underwent heterologous repeat CHMI with the P. falciparum 3D7 clone.
Clinical parameters and the host response to infection were measured up to 3 months after each CHMI.
Nineteen participants underwent primary CHMI with P. vivax, 12 returned for secondary homologous CHMI and 2 for tertiary homologous CHMI with the same parasite clone.
During rechallenge, parasite growth was not attenuated and there was minimal induction of invasion-blocking antibodies.
Nonetheless, clinical symptoms including fever and laboratory abnormalities were less frequent and of lower severity during rechallenge and multi-analyte plasma profiling revealed an attenuated inflammatory response.
Six participants who had completed P. vivax CHMI, then underwent heterologous rechallenge with P. falciparum.
Six participants who had completed P. vivax CHMI, then underwent heterologous rechallenge with P. falciparum.
Previous infection with P. vivax did not protect participants against symptoms, fever or inflammation upon exposure to P. falciparum.
Previous infection with P. vivax did not protect participants against symptoms, fever or inflammation upon exposure to P. falciparum.
Clinical immunity to P. vivax developed rapidly after a single CHMI, protecting participants against fever and laboratory abnormalities associated with malaria and was underpinned by the attenuation of inflammation.
In contrast, there was no evidence of anti-parasite immunity, suggesting that mechanisms of clinical immunity can operate independently of pathogen load to reduce the damage caused by malaria.
Clinical immunity to P. vivax was parasite species-specific and provided no protection against CHMI with P. falciparum.
Clinical immunity to P. vivax was parasite species-specific and provided no protection against CHMI with P. falciparum.
Cascades of effectiveness of new-generation insecticide-treated nets against malaria, from entomological trials to real-life conditions  As insecticide resistance spreads in Africa, new-generation insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are increasingly being deployed to protect vulnerable populations against malaria.
While these nets provide greater entomological efficacy against resistant mosquitoes, their effectiveness against malaria transmission also depends on other factors, such as durability, access, usage, and activity patterns of hosts and vectors.
Here, we quantify the impact of two new-generation ITNs, namely Interceptor(R)G2 (chlorfenapyr-pyrethroid) and Olyset(R)Plus (piperonyl butoxide-pyrethroid), in a cascade from entomological efficacy to population-level effectiveness.
We use a mathematical model that we parameterize with entomological data and validate against results from randomized controlled trials.
We found that, beyond entomological factors, operational factors including functional survival, ITN use and in-bed exposure critically impact ITN effectiveness overall and per ITN types.
Factors Associated with Recurrent Malaria Episodes among Children Under Five at Kayunga Regional Referral Hospital in Kayunga District, Central Uganda  BackgroundMalaria poses a substantial global challenge and continues to be a major cause of mortality and morbidity in numerous developing nations.
Children under the age of five in low- and middle-income countries such as Uganda are the most affected.
Recurrent episodes of malaria have significant consequences for both children and their families.
However, there remains a deficiency in knowledge regarding recurrent malaria episodes in Uganda.
ObjectiveTo determine the prevalence and factors associated with recurrent malaria episodes among children under five at Kayunga Regional Referral Hospital.
MethodologyThis was a cross-sectional study conducted among children under five at Kayunga Regional Referral Hospital in central Uganda.
The data was collected among 254 consecutively sampled participants who were caring for children under five.
Data was collected using a researcher-administered questionnaire and analyzed at univariate, bivariate, and multivariate levels.
ResultsA total of 250 participants participated in the study with a response rate of 98.45%.
The prevalence of recurrent malaria episodes was 84% (210).
The factors associated with recurrent malaria episodes were; children from houses that were annually sprayed (aOR; 8.93, 95CI%,2.11-37.81), children who were treated with quinine antimalarial in the previous infection (aOR, 0.28, 95%CI,0.12-0.65) and children who were residing in a house whose windows were closed at 7-8 pm (aOR, 8.31, 95%CI, 2.21-31.27).
ConclusionNearly 90% of children under the age of five years experienced recurrent malaria episodes.
These recurrent infections were more frequent among children from houses that were annually sprayed and those from houses with delayed window closure compared to those who had been treated using quinine-based antimalarials.
While quinine-based antimalarials remain an important treatment option, alternative or complementary malaria prevention strategies, such as frequent indoor spraying and early closure of windows should be prioritized.
Estimating health facility-level catchment populations using routine surveillance data and a Bayesian gravity model  Accurate estimates of health facility catchment populations are crucial for understanding spatial heterogeneity in disease incidence, targeting healthcare interventions, and allocating resources effectively.
Despite improvements in health facility reporting, reliable catchment population data remain sparse.
This study introduces a Bayesian gravity model-based approach for estimating catchment populations at health facilities, with a focus on Zambias routine malaria surveillance data from 2018-2023.
We developed an open-source R package to implement this method, and we apply this model to Zambian health facilities and compare the results to reported headcount data, highlighting improvements in stratification of malaria incidence rates.
Additionally, we validate the models sensitivity using real-world treatment-seeking data from household surveys in Southern Province, Zambia, demonstrating its utility in enhancing sub-district-level health facility data for strategic planning.
Validation of model facility selection rates compared to the treatment-seeking data showed a model sensitivity of 0.72 overall, with sensitivity reaching 0.89 for households within 2 kilometers of their preferred facility.
Projected ecological and disruptive impacts of climate change on malaria in Africa  The implications of climate change for malaria eradication in the 21st century remain poorly resolved.
Many studies have focussed on parasite and vector ecology in isolation, neglecting the interactions between climate, malaria control, and the socioeconomic environment, including the disruptive impact of extreme weather.
Here we integrate 25 years of data on climate, malaria burden, control interventions, socioeconomic factors, and extreme weather events in Africa.
Using a geotemporal model linked to an ensemble of climate projections under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5 (SSP 2-4.5) scenario, we estimate the future impact of climate change on malaria burden in Africa, accounting for both ecological and disruptive effects.
Our findings suggest climate change could lead to 123 million (projection range 49.5 million - 203 million) additional malaria cases and 532,000 (195,000 - 912,000) additional deaths in Africa between 2024 and 2050 under current control levels.
Contrary to the prevailing focus on ecological mechanisms, extreme weather events emerge as the primary driver of increased risk, accounting for 79% (50-94%) of additional cases and 93% (70%-100%) of additional deaths.
These results highlight the urgent need for climate-resilient malaria control strategies and robust emergency response systems to safeguard progress toward malaria eradication in Africa.
Noncommunicable diseases associated with hemorrhagic disorders, hospitalization and mortality in patients with dengue in Mexico: a national analysis of confirmed cases in 2024  BackgroundIn Mexico, some of the most prevalent non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among adults are diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Mexico could be going through a syndemic of dengue and NCDs.
This study aims to describe and analyze the association between the prevalence of NCDs and hospitalization, the presence of hemorrhagic disorders, and death in all officially confirmed cases of dengue in Mexico during 2024.
Methodology/Principal FindingsThis cross-sectional study is carried out through a secondary analysis of the confirmed cases of dengue reported in 2024.
The likelihood of hospitalization, hemorrhagic disorders, and death were assessed according to NCDs, estimating odds ratios (ORs).
A multivariate logistic regression model was used, adjusting by age, sex, and for each of the NCDs (diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, immunosuppression, cirrhosis, and peptic ulcer disease).
The most co-prevalent non-communicable diseases were diabetes, hypertension, CKD, and immunosuppression.
For hospitalization, CKD has the highest risk of hospitalization (OR 5.73), followed by immunosuppression (OR 2.84), peptic ulcer disease (OR 2.35), and diabetes (OR 2.09).
We found higher probabilities for having bleeding disorders in people with diabetes (OR 19.51), peptic ulcer disease (OR 7.85), immunosuppression (OR 4.75), cirrhosis (OR 3.37), and hypertension (OR 2.99) compared to people who did not have these diseases.
The highest risk for death was observed in the cases with CKD (OR 6.54), followed by peptic ulcer disease (OR 3.09) and diabetes (OR 2.87).
Conclusions/SignificancePatients with dengue and some comorbidities were more likely to have worse clinical outcomes, such as being hospitalized, having bleeding disorders, or dying.
The syndemic of NCDs and dengue in Mexico has been rapidly increasing, and this problem needs to be addressed.
This work demonstrates that patients with these comorbidities have worse clinical outcomes.
Increasing dengue outbreaks in temperate Brazil is linked to Aedes aegypti invasion and infestation level driving widespread virus transmission  Dengue fever, caused by the dengue virus (DENV), is the most important mosquito-borne disease impacting human health globally, it is particularly prevalent in tropical regions where Aedes vectors thrive.
However, due to a recent expansion of the main dengue vectors to subtropical and temperate zones in the last decades there is an increasing human population at risk.
Brazil is a global hotspot for dengue, accounting for 70% of all dengue cases reported worldwide in 2024.
Noteworthy, dengue became endemic even in the southernmost Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, which until recently had only imported cases.
In this study, we integrated entomological, epidemiological, and high-resolution genomic data to investigate DENV transmission dynamics in Southern Brazil over nine years.
From 2015 to 2023, we detected a partial to full invasion of the state municipalities by Aedes aegypti, with dengue cases increasing substantially from 2020 onwards.
Invaded municipalities that surpassed a given case incidence level also increased, and by 2023, nearly half of the municipalities of the state surpassed that threshold, suggesting that dengue became endemic in the region.
By analyzing 665 newly generated DENV genomes, we observed persistent overwintering lineages driving seasonal outbreaks, with the Northwest and Metropolitan regions serving as the main transmission hubs for dengue spread in the state.
These regions were also the first to experience the endemic establishment of dengue lineages, making them key areas for targeted control efforts to mitigate further local outbreaks and the virus spread to other regions.
These findings underscore the expansion of DENV-affected areas and increasing outbreaks into temperate zones, likely driven by the spread of the vector, associated with increased infestation level of the vector and widespread viral transmission in an immunologically naive population.
In this context, enhanced control efforts are critical to mitigate the dengue burden in previously non-endemic areas.
Estimating the potential malaria morbidity and mortality avertable by the President's Malaria Initiative in 2025: a geospatial modelling analysis  BackgroundSince its inception in 2005, the Presidents Malaria Initiative (PMI) has played a major role in the reductions in malaria morbidity and mortality witnessed across Africa.
With the status of PMI funding and operations currently uncertain, this study aimed to quantify the impact that a fully-functioning PMI would have on malaria cases and deaths in Africa during 2025.
MethodsWe combined detailed spatio-temporal information on planned 2025 PMI and non-PMI malaria commodity procurement and distribution in Africa with spatio-temporal Bayesian models of intervention coverage and Plasmodium falciparum transmission and burden in Africa.
By comparing coverage scenarios with and without planned PMI contributions we estimated the number of malaria cases and deaths PMI would avert in 2025.
FindingsWe estimated that business-as-usual PMI contributions to vector control, seasonal chemoprevention, and routine malaria treatment in Africa would avert in 2025 13{middle dot}6M (95% uncertainty interval 11{middle dot}4M - 16{middle dot}4M) malaria cases and 104,000 (69,000 - 161,000) deaths.
This represents 11{middle dot}3% (9{middle dot}9 - 12{middle dot}9%) and 37{middle dot}5% (34{middle dot}2 - 41{middle dot}5%), respectively, of the total burden of malaria morbidity and mortality in PMIs focus geographies across 27 African countries.
These estimates do not account for the additional impact of PMI-supported provision of diagnostics or severe case management commodities, nor preventive treatment for pregnant women which would add further to the averted burden.
InterpretationPMI investment in supporting procurement and distribution of malaria control commodities would translate directly into millions of malaria cases averted and a hundred thousand lives saved across its focus geographies in Africa across 2025.
Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed on 25 February 2025 with the search term "Presidents Malaria Initiative" AND (impact OR evaluation) AND (burden OR malaria cases OR malaria deaths).
102 results were returned, of which four directly addressed the question of PMI-attributable impact on malaria burden across all its focus geographies.
One focussed solely on case-management and did not provide quantitative results1.
A study focussing on mortality found a strong association between PMI investment and declines in all-cause infant mortality2.
Another study used a generalised estimating equation approach to assess PMIs impact, concluding a strong association between PMI spending and reductions in malaria burden3.
A 2017 study used a mechanistic malaria model to estimate PMIs historic contribution to reductions in malaria morbidity and mortality, with future projections to 20204.
Added value of this studyIn this study we synthesised the most up-to-date information of all-funder volumes of key malaria control interventions (ITN, IRS, ACT, SMC) with PMI data on planned volumes and spatial targeting of funding in 2025 to derive near-real-time projections of malaria control intervention coverage in Africa under two scenarios: a business-as-usual scenario in which PMI commodities procured and distributed as previously planned versus a  no-PMI scenario in which PMI funding and technical assistance is absent.
These scenario-based estimates of coverage were propagated through an empirical geospatial malaria model, coupled to mechanistic models of clinical incidence, in order to estimate the number of malaria infections, clinical cases, and deaths PMI activities could expect to avert in Africa in 2025.
Implications of all available evidencePMI is a key contributor to malaria control efforts in Africa, and as such its impact on averting childhood mortality has been demonstrated repeatedly.
Here, using empirically-derived estimates of malaria control impact, combined with detailed scenarios of intervention coverage with and without PMI support, we isolated the contemporary impact of PMI activities on malaria morbidity and mortality in Africa in 2025.
Our findings suggest that PMI support is critical to maintaining suppression of malaria transmission in its focus geographies.
Fine scale spatial mapping of urban malaria prevalence for microstratification in an urban area of Ghana  BackgroundMalaria in urban areas is a growing concern in most sub-Saharan African countries.
The growing threats of Anopheles stephensi and insecticide resistance magnify this concern and hamper elimination efforts.
It is therefore imperative to identify areas, within urban settings, of high-risk of malaria to help better target interventions.
MethodsIn this study, we combined a set of environmental, climatic, and urban covariates with observed data from a malaria prevalence study and used geospatial methods to predict malaria risk in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana.
Georeferenced data from 12,371 surveyed children aged between 6 months and 10 years were included in the analysis.
ResultsPredicted malaria prevalence in this age group ranged from 0 to 52%.
Satellite-driven data on tasselled cap brightness, enhanced vegetation index and a combination of urban covariates were predictive of malaria prevalence in the study region.
We produced a map that quantified the probability of malaria prevalence exceeding 10%.
ConclusionsThis map revealed areas within the districts earmarked for malaria elimination that have high malaria risk.
This work is providing evidence for use by the National Malaria Elimination Program and District Health Managers in planning and deploying appropriate malaria control strategies.
Summary boxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known?C_ST_ABSReduction in malaria incidence globally has stalled in the past few years.
Malaria endemic countries are being encouraged to use local data to inform appropriate malaria control strategies.
Malaria prevalence studies seldomly provide estimates below regional administrative levels.
The availability of environmental, climatic, and socioeconomic factors as well as computational methods has enhanced predictive methods that quantifies the disproportionate variation of malaria risk between and within urban areas.
What are the new findings?Predictive maps of malaria at high spatial resolutions such as 100m allows for visualizing fine-scale heterogeneity of malaria in neighbourhoods.
Inclusion of urban covariates in models predicting malaria risk in urbanized communities helps to account for socioeconomic disparities and their effect on malaria risk.
What do the new findings imply?Malaria control efforts needs to be guided by highly granular data.
Systems to generate granular data on a continuous basis needs to be strengthen in malaria endemic countries, especially, to better inform deployment of appropriate interventions in resource constraint settings.
Calibration of transmission-dynamic infectious disease models: a scoping review and reporting framework  Objective/BackgroundTransmission-dynamic models are commonly used to study infectious disease epidemiology.
Calibration involves identifying model parameter values that align model outputs with observed data or other evidence.
Inaccurate calibration and inconsistent reporting produce inference errors and limit reproducibility, compromising confidence in modeled results.
MethodsWe developed a 15-item framework for reporting calibration practices and applied it in a scoping review to assess calibration approaches and evaluate reporting comprehensiveness in transmission-dynamic models of tuberculosis, HIV and malaria published between January 1, 2018, and January 16, 2024.
ResultsWe identified 411 eligible studies encompassing 419 models, with 74% (n=309) being compartmental models and 20% (n=82) individual-based models (IBMs).
The predominant analytical purpose was to evaluate interventions (71% of models, n=298).
Parameters were calibrated mainly because they were unknown or ambiguous (40%, n=168), or because determining their value was relevant to the scientific question beyond being necessary to run the model (20%, n=85).
The choice of calibration method was significantly associated with model structure (p-value<0.001) and stochasticity (p-value=0.006), with approximate Bayesian computation more frequently used with IBMs and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo with compartmental models.
Regarding reporting comprehensiveness, all 15 framework items in the framework were reported in 4% (n=18) of models; 11-14 items in 66% (n=277), and 10 or fewer items in 28% (n= 124).
Implementation code was the least reported, available in only 20% (n=82) of models.
ConclusionsReporting on calibration is heterogeneous in recent infectious disease modeling literature.
Despite its importance, there has not been a standardized framework for reporting how calibration is conducted in infectious disease modeling studies.
To assess calibration practices and their reporting, we applied our framework in a scoping review of 419 infectious disease transmission models of HIV, TB and malaria published between 2018 and 2024.
Most models reviewed were compartmental (74%) or individual-based (20%), and the choice of calibration methods was associated with model structure and stochasticity.
Calibration was conducted predominantly in the context of models aimed at evaluating the impact of disease control interventions, highlighting the role of calibration in decision making.
Parameters were calibrated mainly because they were unknown or ambiguous, or because reporting their value was relevant to the scientific question beyond just being necessary to run the model.
Accessible implementation code was the most underreported, with only 20% of models including it.
Disentangling the roles of different vector species during a malaria resurgence in Eastern Uganda  In 2021-23, a resurgence of malaria occurred in the Tororo District of Uganda following a change in formulations used for indoor residual spraying of insecticide (IRS).
Prior analyses showed that this increase was temporally associated with the replacement of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato by An.
funestus as the dominant local vector.
To investigate this association, we used data from a cohort of 422 children in 94 households from 2021-2023 in Tororo District and neighboring Busia District, where IRS was not implemented.
Participants underwent passive and monthly active surveillance for infection with Plasmodium falciparum by quantitative PCR.
Mosquitoes were collected in each sleeping room in cohort households every 2 weeks using CDC light traps.
We assessed the association between spatiotemporally smoothed annualized household entomologic inoculation rates (aEIR) and individual P. falciparum infections using shared frailty models.
Overall, each doubling of the aEIR was associated with a 29% increase in the hazard of P. falciparum (adjusted HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.25-1.33).
funestus: a doubling of An.
funestus aEIR was associated with a 29% increase in hazard rate (1.29, 1.25-1.34), while the association was smaller for An.
gambiae (1.04, 1.01-1.08).
These relationships were stronger in Tororo than in Busia.
gambiae with An.
funestus was a driver of increased malaria incidence in Tororo District and demonstrates associations between household-level entomological data and risk of P. falciparum infection.
Metagenomic investigation of febrile illness in Pakistan reveals global transmission and co-circulation of Zika and Dengue viruses  We report the first identification of Zika virus in Pakistan following genomic and serological analyses of blood samples from 20 patients with febrile illness.
In November 2021, an outbreak of dengue-like illness occurred in the metropolitan city of Karachi.
Viral genome capture and sequencing of seven patients revealed six cases of dengue virus serotype 2 and two Zika virus infections, including one dengue and Zika virus co-infection.
The next year, following severe flooding, 13 suspected dengue patients were screened by real time qRT-PCR and serology, and 92% (12/13) had evidence of current or recent Zika virus infection.
Phylogenetic analyses revealed the Zika viruses originated from Brazil.
The most recent observed ancestor dates to 2016, suggesting a prior importation event and ongoing circulation.
Our results suggest that Zika virus may be circulating and contributing to disease burden during seasonal Dengue outbreak.
Seasonal variation and interspecies dynamics among Plasmodium falciparum and ovale species in Bagamoyo, Tanzania  BackgroundMalaria control in sub-Saharan Africa is typically focused on Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), but non-falciparum species like P. ovale curtisi (Poc) and P. ovale wallikeri (Pow) appear to be rising in prevalence, especially in East Africa.

Plasmodium positivity was compared across seasons and demographic groups, and interactions between species were analyzed via binomial regression.
ResultsPf infection (prevalence 27.4%) was associated with younger age, male sex, and higher recent cumulative rainfall, whereas these associations were not apparent for P. ovale (Po, prevalence 11.5%).
Po infections appeared to peak during months with lower Pf prevalence, especially during the long wet season, when Po mono-infections predominated and fewer Pf-Po co-infections were detected than expected by independent assortment.
This apparent antagonism was reversed during the short wet season: Pf-Po co-infections were comparatively enriched despite low overall Po prevalence.
In contrast, excess mixed Poc/Pow infections were detected across all seasons, composing 23% of the Po-positive isolates in which a specific Po species could be detected.
ConclusionsThe epidemiology of P. ovale species in coastal Tanzania suggests they are frequently present when P. falciparum recedes, but also co-infect the same hosts during the short wet season.
ConclusionsThe epidemiology of P. ovale species in coastal Tanzania suggests they are frequently present when P. falciparum recedes, but also co-infect the same hosts during the short wet season.
Meanwhile, the individual Poc and Pow species often co-exist within individuals, perhaps due to co-transmission or concurrent relapse.
Power and sample size considerations for test-negative design with bias correction: a case study on the world first malaria vaccine  BackgroundTest-negative design (TND) studies are increasingly common in evaluating vaccine effectiveness (VE) for various infectious diseases.
TND studies are susceptible to bias due to disease outcome misclassification caused by imperfect test sensitivity and specificity.
Several bias correction methods have been proposed.
However, sample size or power considerations for TND studies incorporating bias correction for such misclassification have not yet been investigated.
MethodsMotivated by the worlds first malaria vaccine, we investigated how bias correction influences statistical power and sample size for VE estimation using Monte Carlo simulations.
Under realistic assumptions about the proportion of vaccinated individuals in the general population, VE against clinical cases, and the probability of malaria diagnosis in unvaccinated individuals, we estimated the power to detect VE across different malaria vaccination statuses, with and without bias correction, at diagnostic test sensitivities of 60%, 80%, and 95%, and a specificity of 98%.
ResultsThe results demonstrated that using imperfect diagnostic tests reduces statistical power in both observed data-based VE and bias-corrected VE.
The magnitude of power loss was substantially influenced by the sensitivity of the tests.
ConclusionsDuring the design phase of a TND study, researchers should conduct power calculations accounting for correcting the bias due to outcome misclassification.
Assessment of Digital Payment for Agents in Mass Chemoprevention Campaigns: The Karangue Fay Project in Senegal  IntroductionThe payment of healthcare agents is a crucial aspect of organizing mass health campaigns.
This study aims to examine the effects of digital payments in seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) campaigns in Senegal.
MethodsThis quasi-experimental study used a three-arm before-after/here-elsewhere design, including (i) a mandatory digital payment zone in Kounkane (Kolda region), (ii) a voluntary digital payment zone in Koussanar (Tambacounda region), and (iii) a control zone without digital payment in Bantaco (Kedougou region).
A mixed-method approach combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection was employed from March to June 2023.
ResultsA total of 299 agents participated in the study, with 181 surveyed before the intervention and 118 after.
Among them, 33.5% were single, while 65.2% were married.
Male agents constituted 50.8% of the sample.
Most SMC agents used Wave and Orange Money accounts (69.89%), with 90% using Orange Money and 96% using Wave.
The main criteria for choosing a reliable money transfer operator included security (95%), ease of use (90.3%), and cash availability (79.2%).
Users perceived Karangue Fay as a more secure financial transaction system (82.45%), a reliable process (83.10%), enabling faster transactions (78.20%), more transparent (91.25%), and confidential (95.20%).
Compared to cash payments, digital payments were preferred for their transaction security (p<0.001), speed, and ease of use (p<0.001).
Qualitative interviews highlighted that digital payments were traceable, fast, and secure; however, reliability depended on stable internet coverage.
Additionally, digital payments enhanced community health workers engagement and optimized their performance.
Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine versus either drug alone for intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy: a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial  BackgroundTo mitigate adverse consequences of malaria in pregnancy, the World Health Organization recommends intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine.
However, the effectiveness of IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine has been threatened by widespread P. falciparum resistance, especially in East and southern Africa.
For IPTp, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine has shown superior antimalarial effects compared to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, but sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine has been associated with improved birth outcomes.
We hypothesized that a combination of both dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine would provide superior birth outcomes compared to either drug alone.
Methods and FindingsWe conducted a double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial of 2757 pregnant women in Uganda, where resistance of malaria parasites to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is widespread.
Women were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to monthly IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, dihydroartemisinin- piperaquine, or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine.
The primary outcome was the risk of a composite adverse birth outcome defined as any of the following: spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, low birthweight (LBW, <2500 gm), preterm delivery (<37 weeks), small-for-gestational age, or neonatal death.
Secondary outcomes included specific individual adverse birth outcomes, measures of malaria during pregnancy, and safety.
The risk of a composite adverse birth outcome was lower with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine compared to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (26.4% vs. 30.9%, p=0.04).
Combining dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine did not reduce the risk of a composite birth outcome compared to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (30.0% vs. 30.9%, p=0.70) or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (30.0% vs. 26.4%; p=0.10).
Combining dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine did not reduce the risk of a composite birth outcome compared to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (30.0% vs. 30.9%, p=0.70) or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (30.0% vs. 26.4%; p=0.10).
Combining dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine did not reduce the risk of a composite birth outcome compared to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (30.0% vs. 30.9%, p=0.70) or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (30.0% vs. 26.4%; p=0.10).
Considering individual adverse birth outcomes, compared to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was associated with a lower risk of preterm birth (3.1% vs. 5.9%, p=0.007) and a higher risk of small-for-gestational age (22.4% vs. 14.8%, p=0.0006) and low birthweight (6.4% vs. 3.4%, p=0.016) among multigravidae.

ConclusionsDespite the superior antimalarial activity of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was associated with improved birth outcomes.
Combining dihydroartemisinin- piperaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for IPTp did not improve birth outcomes compared to either sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine alone.

A Probabilistic Synthesis of Malaria Epidemiology: Exposure, Infection, Parasite Densities, and Detection  The epidemiology of Plasmodium falciparum malaria presents a unique set of challenges due to the complicated dynamics of infection, immunity, disease, and detection.
Studies of malaria epidemiology commonly measure malaria parasite densities or prevalence, but since malaria is so complex with so many factors to consider, a complete mathematical synthesis of malaria epidemiology has been elusive.
From a simple model of malaria exposure and infection in human cohorts as they age, we develop random variables describing the multiplicity of infection (MoI) and the age of infection (AoI).
We also derived a random variable describing the age of the youngest infection (AoY), which can be used to compute approximate parasite densities in complex infections.
Finally, we derive a simple system of differential equations with hybrid variables that track the mean MoI, AoI and AoY, and we show it matches the complex probabilistic system with reasonable accuracy.
We can thus compute the state of any individual chosen at random from the population in two ways.
The same approach - pairing random variables and hybrid models - can be extended to model other features of malaria epidemiology, including disease, malaria immunity, treatment and chemoprotection, and infectiousness.
The computational simplicity of hybrid models has some advantages over compartmental models and stochastic individual-based models, and with the supporting probabilistic framework, provide a sound basis for a synthesis of observational malaria epidemiology.
SignificanceThe probabilistic framework presented here represents a step forward in the theory for observational malaria epidemiology.
Using these methods, one can connect the heterogeneous dynamics of individual infections to both observational and process uncertainty in estimates of population-level metrics such as cross-sectional surveys of prevalence by light microscopy.
The Influence of Intimate Partner Violence on Non-Facility Births Attended by Unskilled Providers in Tanzania: Evidence from the 2022 Demographic and Health Survey  BackgroundNon-facility births assisted by unskilled attendants remain a significant public health concern in Tanzania.
This study aimed to assess the influence of intimate partner violence (IPV) as a predictor of non-facility births attended by unskilled individuals in Tanzania.
MethodThe study used the 2022 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey and Malaria Indicator Survey (2022 TDHS-MIS) dataset, with a weighted sample of 2,284 women of reproductive age who gave birth two years preceding the survey and were included in intimate partners violence survey.
Both univariate and multiple regression analyses were used to identify significant determinants of non-facility birth.
ResultA total of 438 women (19.2%) had non-facility births assisted by unskilled attendants.
After adjusting for confounding factors, key predictors of non-facility births included ever experiencing any form of IPV (aOR=1.383, p=0.007).
Other significant factors were educational attainment, with women having no formal education (aOR=2.718, p<0.001) and primary education (aOR=1.785, p=0.011) being more likely to give birth outside a facility; wealth index [poorest (aOR=7.468, p<0.001), poorer (aOR=4.434, p<0.001), middle (aOR=3.27, p=0.001) and richer (aOR=2.734, p=0.005)]; Antenatal Care (ANC) attendance less than four visits (aOR=1.574, p<0.001); number of children ever born [Two to four (aOR=2.408, p<0.001), more than four (aOR=3.119, p<0.001)] and ever terminated pregnancy (aOR=1.525, p=0.026).
ConclusionWomen who experienced IPV had significantly higher odds of non-facility births.
Other crucial predictors included low educational attainment, poverty, having multiple children, attending fewer than four ANC visits, and a history of pregnancy termination.
Since IPV is a modifiable risk factor, early detection during ANC visits and the implementation of targeted interventions could greatly enhance access to facility-based births with skilled professionals, thereby improving maternal and child health outcomes.
Towards an open analysis ecosystem for Plasmodium genomic epidemiology  Major advances in Plasmodium sequencing approaches, bioinformatic pipelines, and data analysis tools have provided valuable insights into malaria epidemiology from parasite genomic data.
Significant barriers limit the integration of these advances into a functional data analysis ecosystem that produces standardized, interpretable results for use by national malaria control programs.
The Plasmodium Genomic Epidemiology (PlasmoGenEpi) network convened 18 subject matter experts across 15 institutions at the Reproducibility, Accessibility, Documentation, and Interoperability Standards Hackathon in 2023 (RADISH23) to identify available analysis tools, evaluate software standards, improve documentation, and outline workflows.
Eight use cases for genomic data were identified, and a subset were developed into analysis workflows in terms of a series of connected functionalities.
Software tools were then mapped against functionalities to outline a modular approach to data analysis for these use cases.
Forty Plasmodium genomic analysis tools were identified, of which 22 were prioritized for software standards evaluation.
Additional tutorials were developed for 10 tools in the form of reproducible code applied to shared datasets.
These resources are available on PGEforge (mrc- ide.github.io/PGEforge), a new community resource that serves as a central, open repository for current and future resources for malaria genomic data analysis.
Understudied anophelines may sustain residual transmission during the dry season in a pre-elimination setting in southern Zambia  Malaria control is a public health priority but common control methods like indoor residual spraying and the use of bednets do not target outdoor-biting vectors.
In settings with seasonal residual malaria transmission, we lack critical knowledge regarding anopheline species composition and their role in transmission.
This study aimed to determine relative seasonal vector species abundance and associated household level factors in a low transmission setting in Choma District, Zambia.
Indoor and outdoor adult vector collections were embedded in a community-based longitudinal cohort study in 60 households that were visited monthly for 2 years between 2018 and 2020.
Surveys conducted at the time of trap placement collected information on animal ownership, housing structure, and the receipt of malaria interventions.
Anopheline species identities were molecularly confirmed by polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum.
Generalized linear mixed effects negative binomial regression with zero-inflation models were used to describe the relationship between risk factors and the outcome of monthly anopheline counts at each household, stratified by season.
The study collected 1,532 female anophelines, 76% of which were caught outdoors.
The relative abundance differed by season: in the dry season, 90% of female anophelines were caught outdoors.
Anopheles arabiensis was overall the most common vector, but made up only 28% of outdoor collections; the remainder were understudied anophelines including An.
The only Plasmodium falciparum-infected mosquito was an An.
squamosus that was caught outdoors.
Owning more goats was associated with a 3.5 (IRR 4.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.00, 10.01) and 7.7 (IRR 8.73, 95% CI: 4.40, 17.32) times increase in indoor and outdoor anopheline collections in the dry season and a 1.2 (IRR 2.18, 95% CI: 1.12, 4.23) times higher risk of outdoor anophelines in the rainy season.
Improved housing structure was associated with fewer indoor anophelines in the rainy season, but not during dry season or outdoor anopheline abundance any time of year.
Vector control in this low transmission setting, therefore, needs to target anopheline mosquitoes year-round, must be expanded to target traditionally zoophillic mosquitoes, and leverage known risk factors when selecting methods of control.
Seroprevalence and preventive practices of dengue and chikungunya among school children in Bangkok: Gaps in prevention and vaccination strategies  BackgroundDengue and chikungunya, both transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, continue to pose significant public health concerns in Thailand, particularly during the rainy season.
Despite ongoing vector control efforts, the incidence of infection remains high, with an increasing trend observed in chikungunya.
This study aims to assess the seroprevalence of dengue and chikungunya infections among children aged 10-15 years in Bangkok and to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) related to mosquito-borne disease prevention.
MethodologyA cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted across 12 schools in Bangkok.
Children aged 10 to 15 years were included.
Seroprevalence was determined using rapid diagnostic tests (Abbott DENGUE IgG/IgM and Citest Chikungunya IgG/IgM) based on the immunochromatography technique, using fingertip blood samples.
Parents completed KAP questionnaires, including factors influencing vaccination decisions.
Principal findingsFrom June to August 2024, 937 participants were enrolled, with a mean (SD) age of 11 (1.6) years; 67% were aged 10-12 years, and 33% were aged 13-15 years.
The seroprevalence of dengue was 28.1% (95% CI 25.2-31.0), while that of chikungunya was 6.3% (95% CI 4.7-7.9).
KAP assessments revealed a high level of awareness regarding symptoms and transmission; however, notable deficiencies in preventive behaviors were identified.
Only 14.8% of respondents reported consistent use of mosquito repellent, and 17.5% routinely inspected and removed mosquito larvae from their homes.
ConclusionThe substantial seroprevalence of dengue and the emerging trend of chikungunya among children in Bangkok highlights the urgent need to enhance community education and strengthen vector control interventions.
Expanding dengue vaccination coverage and raising awareness about chikungunya prevention, including consideration for future vaccine implementation, are essential to mitigating future outbreaks and reducing the disease burden.
Author summaryO_LIMosquito-borne diseases, including dengue and chikungunya, are significant health problems in Southeast Asia.
In our study, we evaluate the seroprevalence of these diseases using rapid blood tests in a school-based setting among children in Bangkok.
Therefore, implementing effective preventive measures and vaccination strategies could significantly reduce the severity of infections and improve public health outcomes.

Mucocutaneous Manifestations of Dengue Fever and Its Correlation with Disease Severity: A Cross-Sectional Study.
IntroductionDengue fever (DF), a mosquito-borne viral illness, has seen a rise in cases worldwide including Nepal.
While systemic manifestations are well-documented, mucocutaneous lesions are less studied.
This study aims to identify the mucocutaneous manifestations of DF and explore their correlation with disease severity, marking the first such effort in Nepal.
MethodsThis hospital-based descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted between August 2023 to July 2024 at Nepal Medical College Teaching Hospital, a tertiary care center in Kathmandu, Nepal.
Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Committee of Nepal Medical College (IRC Reg.
Non-probability convenient sampling was used.
A total of 151 patients clinically diagnosed with DF and confirmed by NS1 antigen and/or IgM positive tests were included.
Data were collected using a structured proforma.
Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16.
ResultsOut of 160,795 patients who visited our hospital from August 2023 to July 2024, 2,059 underwent testing for DF, of which 340 were seropositive, yielding a prevalence of 16.51% (95% CI: 14.97- 18.18) among suspected cases.
Among the 151 participants with DF, 93(61.59%) had mucocutaneous involvement, 42 (27.81%) with cutaneous lesions only and 10(6.62%) with mucosal involvement only.
Both mucosal and cutaneous manifestations were identified in 41(27.15%).
The most common rash was maculopapular 55(36.42%).
Pruritus was reported by 65(43.04%) of patients.
It was significantly correlated with mucocutaneous involvement (p<0.05).
Disease severity classification showed 87 (57.62%) had dengue without warning signs, 52 (34.44%) with warning signs, and 12(7.95%) with severe dengue.
Mucocutaneous manifestations was not significantly associated with disease severity in this study.
ConclusionMucocutaneous manifestations, including maculopapular rashes and pruritus, are common in DF but they do not necessarily correlate with disease severity.
Identifying these signs early can improve diagnosis and management.
Rethinking a hybrid malaria chemoprevention delivery strategy for children in sub-perennial settings: integrating age- and seasonally-targeted delivery  BackgroundThe World Health Organization recommends perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC), generally using sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) to children at high risk of severe P. falciparum malaria.
Currently, PMC is given up to age two in perennial transmission settings.
However, no recommendation exists for perennial settings with seasonal variation in transmission intensity, recently categorized as  sub-perennial.
Tailored chemoprevention strategies are needed to protect children during seasons and ages of highest malaria risk.
The seasonal dimension must adequately cover seasonally increased risk periods, alongside interventions that address year-round, lower intensity transmission.
We propose a hybrid malaria chemoprevention (HMC) strategy, integrating two delivery components: 1) existing PMC, and 2) additional monthly SP doses during the higher-risk rainy season, ensuring a one-month gap between any two doses.
MethodsUsing a validated individual-based malaria model combined with pharmacological models of drug action (OpenMalaria), we examined the potential public health impact of the proposed HMC (for children 03-24 months), and an age-expanded HMC (referred to as HMC+, for children 03-36 months), under different drug sensitivity, coverage, and prevalence (5-70%) assumptions.
ResultsHMC and HMC+ demonstrated a median (interquartile range) of 2.1 (1.6-2.6), 2.9 (2.2-3.6) times higher efficacy (relative fold increase in burden averted) compared to only PMC against clinical, and 2.0 (0.6-3.4), 3.3 (0.8-5.8) against severe cases, respectively, in children under age three.
This led to a median protective efficacy of 31.8% (25.4-38.2%), 44.9% (36.9-52.9%) against clinical, and 16.1% (7.0-25.2%), 26.4% (14.4-38.4%) against severe cases by HMC and HMC+ respectively, across the prevalence, drug sensitivity, and coverage assumptions.
We found positive net impact for children under age five years, outweighing a limited potential of delayed malaria across settings.
ConclusionSubstantially increased public health benefits might be achieved by adding seasonally-targeted chemoprevention to current PMC in sub-perennial malaria transmission settings.
Urinary Schistosomiasis Among Primary School Children in Qua'anPan Local Government Area, Plateau State, Nigeria  BackgroundUrinary schistosomiasis is a freshwater dependent urogenital infection that can be contracted by direct contact activities with water that contains the infective stage of Schistosoma haematobium.
It is second only to malaria in its debilitating effects on humans and is a serious public health problem in Nigeria.
Plateau State is classified as a hyper-endemic area.
ObjectiveThis study was conducted to assess the prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis among primary school children in Quaan-Pan Local Government Area, Plateau State.
MethodThe cross-sectional study comprised of 806 children who provided midstream urine samples in clean labelled urine collection bottles.
Sedimentation technique was used to prepare samples for parasitological examination.
Data obtained was entered into SPSS version 20.0 for data analysis.
ResultsThe overall prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis in this study was 17.87%.
Dokan Kasuwa district had the highest prevalence (27.5%) while the male children had a higher prevalence (20.29%) than the female children.
Children between the ages of 15-19 years had a higher prevalence (24.53%) compared to the other age groups.
Children attending private primary schools had a higher (18.51%) than their counterparts attending public primary schools (17.27%).
ConclusionThe prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis in Quaan-Pan Local Government Area is lower than was previously reported but is still high, the situation should be closely monitored.
More can be done to maintain the drop in prevalence by annual distribution of praziquantel tablets, provision of safe drinking water and creating awareness about the disease.
Temporal trends, SARIMA forecasting of Dengue, and the influence of Dengue-related meteorological factors in Bangladesh: a time series analysis  Dengue is a viral disease spread by mosquitoes and is found primarily in tropical and subtropical areas.
Currently, dengue fever (DF) remains a significant public health challenge in Bangladesh, and various meteorological factors influence its incidence.
This study aims to analyze the temporal patterns of dengue cases from January 2008 to November 2024 and explore the relationships between meteorological factors and the incidence of dengue fever (DF) in Bangladesh, utilizing time series forecasting models and multivariate Poisson models based on monthly dengue case data.
Seasonal decomposition was measured using LOESS seasonal, trend, and residual components.
A SARIMA forecast model for dengue cases and Poisson regression assessed meteorological impacts, considering one- and two-month lags.
The result indicates that the highest number of dengue cases were found in August 2019 (52,636 cases) and in September 2023 (79,598 cases) with September standing out as the peak month in Bangladesh.
Autocorrelation analysis revealed strong positive correlations at 1-month and 2-month lags, indicating the selection of the SARIMA (2,1,2) (1,1,1) [6] model, which effectively captured seasonality with a Mean Absolute Error coefficient of 1649 and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) coefficient of 5203.44.
Forecasts from 2024-2027 predict that dengue cases will fluctuate between 10,000 and 20,000 annually.
Spearmans rank correlation indicated positive associations between dengue cases and precipitation (r = 0.37, p<0.05), temperature (r = 0.28, p<0.05), wind speed (r = 0.25, p<0.05), and humidity (r = 0.18, p<0.05).
Multivariable Poisson regression revealed that temperature ({degrees}C) (IRR = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.02- 1.02, p < 0.001), Humidity (%) (IRR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.24-1.25, p < 0.001), Wind speed (m/s) (IRR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.09-1.10, p < 0.001) significantly increased dengue incidence.
In conclusion, this study emphasizes the critical role of humidity and temperature in shaping dengue incidence in Bangladesh, highlighting the need to integrate climate data into public health strategies for improved forecasting and control.
Geographical Heterogeneity in Antimalarial Resistance Markers Revealed by Genomic Surveillance in Angola, 2023  Plasmodium falciparum malaria remains a leading cause of mortality in Angola, with emerging antimalarial resistance threatening treatment and prevention strategies.
Efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine, one of the countrys preferred malaria treatments, has been reported below 90% in two provinces, underscoring the need for routine resistance surveillance and efficacy monitoring to guide policy decisions.
Between March and July 2023, dried blood spots and demographic data were collected from P. falciparum-positive participants at 16 health facilities across 8 provinces.
Multiplexed amplicon deep sequencing was used to characterize single nucleotide polymorphisms in 12 genes linked with resistance, estimate allele frequencies, and detect co-infecting non-falciparum Plasmodium species.
Sequence data from 817 samples revealed significant geographic variation in resistance markers.
In the southeast, artemisinin partial resistance markers (k13 P574L, P441L), were detected at very low prevalence (<0.1%), while the quintuple dhps/dhfr haplotype, linked to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance, was very prevalent (>40% of samples).
In the northwest, the sextuple dhps/dhfr haplotype, a marker of higher SP resistance, was most prevalent in Zaire (14.2%).
The crt CVIET haplotype, associated with chloroquine resistance, had a national prevalence of 15.9%, detected in over 48% of samples from Zaire and Uige.
The mdr1 N86 genotype, linked to reduced lumefantrine susceptibility, was widespread, detected in 99.3% of samples.
Co-infections of P. falciparum and non-falciparum species were rare with no clear geographic distribution.
No P. vivax co-infections were detected.
These findings highlight the need for continued monitoring to safeguard treatment efficacy, reinforcing the importance of molecular surveillance in malaria control strategies.
Passive surveillance of human African trypanosomiasis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: clinical presentation and prospective evaluation of rapid diagnostic and reference laboratory test accuracy.
BackgroundPassive screening of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is based on rapid diagnostic tests (RDT), but sensitivity of the currently commercialised RDTs has hardly been assessed prospectively.
In view of the increasing importance of remote testing for HAT, the diagnostic performance of reference laboratory tests also needs further documentation.
Clinical suspects in 29 health facilities in DR Congo were screened consecutively between October 2017 and December 2020 with 3 HAT RDTs, including HAT Sero K-SeT, an RDT that is nowadays still commercialised.
HAT RDT positives were examined parasitologically and their dried blood spots tested in trypanolysis, indirect ELISA/T.b.
gambiense, LAMP Trypanosoma brucei Detection Kit and m18S and TgsGp qPCR.
Trypanosomes were detected in 42/3113 study participants.
Logistic regression revealed that sleep disruption, enlarged lymph nodes, psychiatric problems, recurrent fever not responding to anti-malarials and motor disorders were significantly associated with HAT (p<0.05, odds 3.0-10.6).
Together, the RDTs detected 253/3113 seropositives.
Sensitivity and specificity of HAT Sero K-SeT were respectively 100% (42/42; 95% CI 91.6-100%) and 93.9% (2882/3071; 95% CI 92.9-94.6%).
Sensitivity of ELISA/T.b.
gambiense and trypanolysis were 93.9% (31/33; 95% CI 80.4-98.9) and 84.9% (28/33; 95% CI 69.1-93.4), and were [&le;] 63.6% for LAMP, m18S and TgsGp qPCR.
Conclusions/SignificanceCompared to the WHOs target product profiles for gambiense HAT RDTs, the HAT Sero K-SeT RDT had ideal sensitivity but its specificity was on the borderline of minimally acceptable.
Sub-optimal sensitivities of trypanolysis and to a lesser extent, indirect ELISA/T.b.
gambiense when applied on DBS, were confirmed.
Molecular tests for remote testing need to be improved and evaluated further.
Author summaryWhile gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) approaches elimination, its diagnosis increasingly relies on fixed health structures screening clinical suspects with rapid diagnostic tests (RDT).
For confirmation of infection and for epidemiological purposes, remote testing of blood specimens from RDT seropositives also gains importance.
The low HAT prevalence hampers assessment of the sensitivity of HAT RDTs and remote tests.
We prospectively evaluated HAT RDTs and remote reference laboratory tests diagnostic performances in passive screening in 3 countries, and report the results of the Democratic Republic of the Congo here.
The sensitivity of the HAT Sero K-SeT, one of the 2 HAT RDTs that are actually commercialised, complied with the ideal >99% sensitivity of the target product profile established by WHO, but its specificity was on the limit of minimally acceptable, set by WHO at >95%.
Antibody detection with trypanolysis and/or indirect ELISA/T.b.
gambiense is already routinely implemented, but the use of dried blood spots seems to reduce the tests sensitivity.
LAMP Trypanosoma brucei Detection Kit, m18S and TgsGp qPCR were not reliable.
Pregnant womens attitudes and intentions toward tuberculosis, malaria, group B streptococcus, and respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in pregnant: Findings from pregnant women living in Brazil, Ghana, Kenya, and Pakistan  IntroductionThere are numerous infections that can adversely impact a developing fetus, neonates, and pregnant women, and there is limited research related to how specific infections experienced during pregnancy can affect these populations.
Tuberculosis (TB), malaria, Group B streptococcus (GBS) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can cause negative outcomes to maternal and neonatal health.
For TB and GBS, there are vaccines in various stages of clinical trial development, and malaria and RSV vaccines are available.
This study aimed to examine pregnant womens attitudes toward TB, malaria, GBS, and RSV vaccines in Brazil, Ghana, Kenya, and Pakistan.
MethodsWe administered a cross-sectional survey to pregnant women, recruiting women seeking care in primarily urban health facilities.
ResultsWe surveyed 1,603 pregnant women.
Almost one-third of participants (30%) indicated that they would definitely intend to receive a GBS vaccine, followed by malaria (26%), RSV (25%), and TB (19%).
Related to vaccine hesitancy, approximately 40% of our participants agreed that vaccines are unnatural, 38% agreed that the body should develop natural immunity, and 19% had delayed a recommended vaccine.
DiscussionPregnant women are interested in receiving various vaccines while pregnant.
As several new adult vaccines are on the horizon, understanding the attitudes of potential vaccine beneficiaries at higher risk for diseases is critical for informing clinical trial design and, in the long term, vaccine acceptance.
Adapting a LAMP Plasmodium vivax Malaria Diagnostic for Use in Low Resource Settings  Malaria caused by the P. vivax parasite can be difficult to diagnose due to dormant phases and genetic variants.
Regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia experience diagnostic accessibility issues due to the  gold standard diagnostic requiring expensive light microscopy of blood samples.
This study focuses on expanding the potential of Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) as a remote-ready P. vivax malaria diagnostic.
We detected as few as 103 copies of P. vivax.
18S rRNA DNA sequence spiked into molecular water and as few as 106 spiked into saliva.
These results were reproduced when reactions were incubated in a consumer-ready coffee thermos.
This saliva-ready LAMP diagnostic for P. vivax shows promise for remote use and increasing diagnostic access to low-resource regions.
Assessing Long-Lasting Insecticidal Net Coverage, Access, and Utilization: Insights from Malaria-Endemic Regions and Rohingya Camps in Bangladesh  IntroductionMalaria remains a major public health challenge, particularly in endemic regions like Bangladesh.
To combat this, the National Malaria Elimination Programme (NMEP) has been working to ensure long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) reach vulnerable populations.
This study assessed LLIN coverage, access, and utilization among the Bangladeshi population and Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals (FDMN).
MethodsA cross-sectional survey was conducted from May to October 2023 across five malaria-endemic districts in Bangladesh and ten FDMN camps in Coxs Bazar.
Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate LLIN distribution and utilization patterns among different demographic groups, particularly households with pregnant women and under-five children.
ResultsAmong Bangladeshi households, 97.6% owned at least one LLIN, with sufficient coverage for 93.2%.
Utilization was high, with 96.4% sleeping under LLINs the previous night.
Among pregnant women and under-five children, 95.0% and 98.3%, respectively, used LLINs.
ConclusionBangladesh has made significant progress in LLIN coverage and utilization among its population, surpassing WHOs 80% threshold.
However, gaps remain in the FDMN population, necessitating targeted interventions to achieve universal coverage and further reduce malaria morbidity and mortality.
Efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in people living with HIV (PLHIV) diagnosed with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Africa: A WWARN systematic review  BackgroundAfrica bears the highest double burden of HIV and malaria worldwide.
In 2023, an estimated 25.9 million people were living with HIV (PLHIV), and 246 million malaria cases were diagnosed in Africa.
Malaria patients co-infected with HIV are considered at a higher risk of failing malaria treatment, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.
This systematic literature review aims to assess the treatment outcomes following artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in PLHIV.
MethodsThe literature search was conducted up to April 2022 in the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Central, WHO Global Index Medicus, Clinicaltrials.gov, and the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network (WWARN) Clinical Trial Library.
Studies describing any malaria treatment outcomes or anti-malarial drug exposure in PLHIV treated for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection were eligible for inclusion.
ResultsA total of 26 articles describing 19 studies conducted between 2003 and 2017 in six countries were included in this review; it represented 2850 malaria episodes in PLHIV across various transmission settings.
The most studied artemisinin-based combination was artemether-lumefantrine (in 16 studies).
PLHIV were treated with various antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens, namely efavirenz (EFV), nevirapine (NVP), atazanavir-ritonavir (ATVr), lopinavir-ritonavir (LPV/r), and/or on prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TS), or were untreated (in 3 studies).
There was no evidence of an increased risk of recrudescence in PLHIV compared to those without HIV.
When treated with artemether-lumefantrine, PLHIV receiving LPV/r had a lower risk of malaria recurrence compared to PLHIV on NVP-based or EFV-based ART, or those without HIV.
LPV/r increased lumefantrine exposure and EFV-treated patients had a reduced exposure to both artemether and lumefantrine; NVP reduced artemether exposure only.
ConclusionsLimited data on ACT outcomes or drug exposure in PLHIV in Africa remains a reality to date, and the effect of antivirals appears inconsistent in the literature.
Considering the heterogeneity in study designs, these review findings support conducting an individual patient data meta-analysis to explore the impact of antiretroviral therapy on anti-malarial treatment.
Trial registrationThe protocol for the original search was published on PROSPERO with registration number CRD42018089860.
The role of standing variation in geographic convergent adaptation  The extent to which populations experiencing shared selective pressures adapt through a shared genetic response is relevant to many questions in evolutionary biology.
In a number of well studied traits and species, it appears that convergent evolution within species is common.
In this paper, we explore how standing, genetic variation contributes to convergent genetic responses in a geographically spread population, extending our previous work on the topic.
Geographically limited dispersal slows the spread of each selected allele, hence allowing other alleles - newly arisen mutants or present as standing variation - to spread before any one comes to dominate the population.
When such alleles meet, their progress is substantially slowed - if the alleles are selectively equivalent, they mix slowly, dividing the species range into a random tessellation, which can be well understood by analogy to a Poisson process model of crystallization.
Finally, we explore how negative pleiotropic effects of alleles before an environment change can bias the subset of alleles that contribute to the species adaptive response.
We apply the results to the many geographically localized G6PD deficiency alleles thought to confer resistance to malaria, where the large mutational target size makes it a likely candidate for adaptation from standing variation, despite the selective cost of G6PD deficiency alleles in the absence of malaria.
We find the numbers and geographic spread of these alleles matches our predictions reasonably well, consistent with the view that they arose from a combination of standing variation and new mutations since the advent of malaria.
Our results suggest that much of adaptation may be geographically local even when selection pressures are homogeneous.
Therefore, we argue that caution must be exercised when arguing that strongly geographically restricted alleles are necessarily the outcome of local adaptation.
We close by discussing the implications of these results for ideas of species coherence and the nature of divergence between species.
Whole genome sequencing of field isolates reveals extensive genetic diversity in Plasmodium vivax from Colombia  Plasmodium vivax is the most prevalent malarial species in South America and exerts a substantial burden on the populations it affects.
The control and eventual elimination of P. vivax are global health priorities.
Genomic research contributes to this objective by improving our understanding of the biology of P. vivax and through the development of new genetic markers that can be used to monitor efforts to reduce malaria transmission.\n\nHere we analyze whole-genome data from eight field samples from a region in Cordoba, Colombia where malaria is endemic.
We find considerable genetic diversity within this population, a result that contrasts with earlier studies suggesting that P. vivax had limited diversity in the Americas.
We also identify a selective sweep around a substitution known to confer resistance to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP).
This is the first observation of a selective sweep for SP resistance in this species.
These results indicate that P. vivax has been exposed to SP pressure even when the drug is not in use as a first line treatment for patients afflicted by this parasite.
We identify multiple non-synonymous substitutions in three other genes known to be involved with drug resistance in Plasmodium species.
Finally, we found extensive microsatellite polymorphisms.
Using this information we developed 18 polymorphic and easy to score microsatellite loci that can be used in epidemiological investigations in South America.\n\nAuthor SummaryAlthough P. vivax is not as deadly as the more widely studied P. falciparum, it remains a pressing global health problem.
Using this information we developed 18 polymorphic and easy to score microsatellite loci that can be used in epidemiological investigations in South America.\n\nAuthor SummaryAlthough P. vivax is not as deadly as the more widely studied P. falciparum, it remains a pressing global health problem.
Here we report the results of a whole-genome study of P. vivax from Cordoba, Colombia, in South America.
This parasite is the most prevalent in this region.
We show that the parasite population is genetically diverse, which is contrary to expectations from earlier studies from the Americas.
We also find molecular evidence that resistance to an anti-malarial drug has arisen recently in this region.
This selective sweep indicates that the parasite has been exposed to a drug that is not used as first-line treatment for this malaria parasite.
In addition to extensive single nucleotide and microsatellite polymorphism, we report 18 new genetic loci that might be helpful for fine-scale studies of this species in the Americas.
Spread of the pandemic Zika virus lineage is associated with NS1 codon usage adaptation in humans  Zika virus (ZIKV) infections were more common in the zoonotic cycle until the end of the 20th century with few human cases in Africa and Southeastern Asia.
Recently, the Asian lineage of ZIKV is spreading along human-to-human chains of transmission in the Pacific Islands and in South America.
Herein we show that the recent Asian lineage spread is associated with significant NS1 codon usage adaptation to human housekeeping genes, which could facilitate viral replication and increase viral titers.
Furthermore, we predicted several epitopes in the NS1 protein that are shared between ZIKV and Dengue.
Our results imply in a significant dependence of the recent human ZIKV spread on NS1 translational selection.
Transmission dynamics of Zika virus in island populations: a modelling analysis of the 2013-14 French Polynesia outbreak  Between October 2013 and April 2014, more than 30,000 cases of Zika virus (ZIKV) disease were estimated to have attended healthcare facilities in French Polynesia.
ZIKV has also been reported in Africa and Asia, and in 2015 the virus spread to South America and the Caribbean.
Infection with ZIKV has been associated with neurological complications including Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) and microcephaly, which led the World Health Organization to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2015.
To better understand the transmission dynamics of ZIKV, we used a mathematical model to examine the 2013-14 outbreak on the six major archipelagos of French Polynesia.
Our median estimates for the basic reproduction number ranged from 2.6-4.8, with an estimated 11.5% (95% CI: 7.32-17.9%) of total infections reported.
As a result, we estimated that 94% (95% CI: 91-97%) of the total population of the six archipelagos were infected during the outbreak.
Based on the demography of French Polynesia, our results imply that if ZIKV infection provides complete protection against future infection, it would take 12-20 years before there are a sufficient number of susceptible individuals for ZIKV to reemerge, which is on the same timescale as the circulation of dengue virus serotypes in the region.
Our analysis suggests that ZIKV may exhibit similar dynamics to dengue virus in island populations, with transmission characterized by large, sporadic outbreaks with a high proportion of asymptomatic or unreported cases.\n\nAuthor SummarySince the first reported major outbreak of Zika virus disease in Micronesia in 2007, the virus has caused outbreaks throughout the Pacific and South America.
Transmitted by the Aedes species of mosquitoes, the virus has been linked to possible neurological complications including Guillain-Barre Syndrome and microcephaly.
To improve our understanding of the transmission dynamics of Zika virus in island populations, we analysed the 2013-14 outbreak on the six major archipelagos of French Polynesia.
We found evidence that Zika virus infected the majority of population, but only around 12% of total infections on the archipelagos were reported as cases.
If infection with Zika virus generates lifelong immunity, we estimate that it would take at least 15-20 years before there are enough susceptible people for the virus to reemerge.
Our results suggest that Zika virus could exhibit similar dynamics to dengue virus in the Pacific, producing large but sporadic outbreaks in small island populations.
Comparative analysis of dengue and Zika outbreaks reveals differences by setting and virus  The pacific islands of Micronesia have experienced several outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases over the past decade.
Here, we compared three outbreaks of dengue and Zika virus in two different island settings in Micronesia, the Yap Main Islands and Fais, using a mathematical model of transmission dynamics, making full use of commonalities in disease and setting between the outbreaks.
We found that the estimated reproduction numbers for Zika and dengue were similar when considered in the same setting, but that, conversely, reproduction number for the same disease can vary considerably by setting.
On the Yap Main Islands, we estimated a reproduction number of 8.0-16 (95% Credible Interval (CI)) for the dengue outbreak and 4.8-14 (95% CI) for the Zika outbreak, whereas for the dengue outbreak on Fais our estimate was 28-102 (95% CI).
We further found that the proportion of cases of Zika reported was smaller (95% CI 1.4%-1.9%) than that of dengue (95% CI 47%-61%).
They suggest that models for dengue transmission can be useful for estimating the predicted dynamics of Zika transmission, but care must be taken when extrapolating findings from one setting to another.\n\nAuthor SummaryDengue and Zika are related viruses and are both transmitted by mosquitoes.
Dengue is well described and affects people around the world.
Zika, on the other hand has only recently caused outbreak in human populations, and it has been suggested that its behaviour might similar dengue.
To investigate this, we compared three outbreaks of dengue and Zika in island populations of the pacific: two dengue outbreaks and one Zika outbreak.
Island outbreaks are useful laboratories for understanding the spread of infections because they are usually short, well-identified episodes, whereas elsewhere it can be difficult to identify the properties of outbreaks when different viruses spread at the same time.
In our investigation of the outbreaks in Micronesia we found that dengue and Zika virus did, indeed, behave similar in outbreaks they caused on the Yap Main Islands.
A dengue outbreak on the smaller island of Fais, on the other hand, was different from the dengue outbreak on Yap in that transmission seems to have been more efficient.
We conclude that dengue outbreaks are indeed a good model for Zika outbreaks when considered in the same setting, but that one must be careful when comparing outbreaks in different settings.
The genetic basis of host choice and resting behavior in the major African malaria vector, Anopheles arabiensis  Malaria transmission is dependent on the propensity of Anopheles mosquitoes to bitehumans (anthropophily) instead of other dead end hosts.
Recent increases in the usage of Long Lasting Insecticide Treated Nets (LLINs) in Africa have been associated with reductions in highly anthropophilic vectors such as Anopheles gambiae s.s.,leaving less anthropophilic species such as Anopheles arabiensis as the most prominent remaining source of transmission in many settings.
An.arabiensis is more of a generalist in terms of its host choice and resting behavior, which may be due to phenotypic plasticity and/or segregating allelic variation.
arabiensis we performed a genome-wide association study on host choice (human-or cattle-fed) and resting position (collected indoors or outdoors) in the Kilombero Valley, Tanzania.
This represents the first genomic/molecular analysis of host choice and resting behavior in a malaria vector.
We identified a total of 4,820,851 SNPs, which were used to conduct the first genome-wide estimates of 'SNP heritability' for host choice and resting behavior in this species.
A genetic component was detected for host choice (human vs cow fed; permuted P = 0.002), but there was no evidence of a genetic component for resting behavior (indoors versus outside; permuted P = 0.465).
A principal component analysis (PCA) segregated individuals based on genomic variation into three groups which are characterized by differences at the 2Rb and/or 3Ra paracentromeric chromosome inversions.
There was a non-random distribution of cattle-fed mosquitoes between the PCA clusters, suggesting that alleles linked to the 2Rb and/or 3Ra inversions may influence host choice.
Using a novel inversion genotyping assay, we detected a significant enrichment of the standard arrangement (non-inverted) of 3Ra among cattle-fed mosquitoes (N=129) versus all non-cattle-fed individuals (N=234; 2, p=0.007).
Thus, tracking the frequency of the 3Ra in An.
arabiensis populations is important, especially in relation to the emergence of behavioral avoidance(e.g.
shifting toward cattle-feeding) in some populations.
A better understanding of the genetic basis for host choice in An.
In many parts of Africa, Anopheles arabiensis is now the only remaining vec 63 tor in areas where coverage with Long Lasting Insecticide Treated Nets is high.
arabiensis were collected resting indoors and outdoors in the Kilombero Valley, Tanzania.
We sequenced a total of 48 genomes representing 4 phenotypes (human or cow fed, resting in or outdoors) and tested for a genetic basis for each phenotype.
Genomic analysis followed up by application of a novel molecular karyotyping assay revealed a relationship between An.
arabiensis that fed on cattle and the standard arrangement of the 3Ra inversion.
Validation with controlled host preference assays comparing individuals with the standard and inverted arrangement of 3Ra is still needed.
Interactive online brain shape visualization  Urbanization presents unique environmental challenges to human commensal species.
The Afrotropical Anopheles gambiae complex contains a number of synanthropic mosquito species that are major vectors of malaria.
To examine ongoing cryptic diversification within the complex, we performed reduced representation sequencing on 941 mosquitoes collected across four ecogeographic zones in Cameroon.
gambiae s.s. - the two most significant malaria vectors in the region.
Importantly, in both species rural and urban populations of mosquitoes were genetically differentiated.
Genome scans of cryptic subgroups reveal pervasive signatures of selection centered on genes involved in xenobiotic resistance.
Notably, a selective sweep containing eight detoxification enzymes is unique to urban mosquitoes that exploit polluted breeding sites.
Overall, our study reveals that anthropogenic environmental modification is driving population differentiation and local adaptation in African malaria mosquitoes with potentially significant consequences for malaria epidemiology.
Zika virus infection as a cause of congenital brain abnormalities and Guillain-Barre syndrome: systematic review  BackgroundThe World Health Organization stated in March 2016 that there was scientific consensus that the mosquito-borne Zika virus was a cause of the neurological disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome and of microcephaly and other congenital brain abnormalities, based on rapid evidence assessments.
The objectives of this study were: to update and re-assess the evidence for causality through a rapid and systematic review about links between Zika virus infection and a) congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, in the foetuses and offspring of pregnant women and b) Guillain-Barre syndrome in any population; and to describe the process and outcomes of an expert assessment of the evidence about causality.\n\nMethods and findingsThe study had three linked components.
First, in February 2016, we developed a causality framework that defined questions about the relationship between Zika virus infection and each of the two clinical outcomes in 10 dimensions; temporality, biological plausibility, strength of association, alternative explanations, cessation, dose-response, animal experiments, analogy, specificity and consistency.
Second, we did a systematic review (protocol number CRD42016036693).
We searched multiple online sources up to May 30, 2016 to find studies that directly addressed either outcome and any causality dimension, used methods to expedite study selection, data extraction and quality assessment, and summarised evidence descriptively.
We found 1091 unique items up to May 30, 2016.
For congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, we included 72 items; for eight of 10 causality dimensions (all except dose-response relationship and specificity) we found that more than half the relevant studies supported a causal association with Zika virus infection.
For Guillain-Barre syndrome, we included 36 items, of which more than half the relevant studies supported a causal association in seven of ten dimensions (all except dose-response relationship, specificity and animal experimental evidence).
Articles identified non-systematically from May 30-July 29, 2016 strengthened the review findings.
The expert panel concluded that: a) the most likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection and clusters of microcephaly is that Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital brain abnormalities including 61 microcephaly; and b) the most likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection and Guillain-Barre syndrome is that Zika virus infection is a trigger of Guillain-Barre syndrome.
The expert panel recognised that Zika virus alone may not be sufficient to cause either congenital brain abnormalities or Guillain-Barre syndrome but agreed that the evidence was sufficient to recommend increased public health measures.
Weaknesses are the limited assessment of the role of dengue virus and other possible co-factors, the small number of comparative epidemiological studies, and the difficulty in keeping the review up to date with the pace of publication of new research.\n\nConclusionsRapid and systematic reviews with frequent updating and open dissemination are now needed, both for appraisal of the evidence about Zika virus infection and for the next public health threats that will emerge.
This rapid systematic review found sufficient evidence to say that Zika virus is a cause of congenital abnormalities and is a trigger of Guillain-Barre situation.
PfClpC Is An Essential Clp Chaperone Required For Plastid Integrity And Clp Protease Stability In Plasdmodium Falciparum  Apicomplexan parasites such as Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, contain a non-photosynthetic plastid known as the apicoplast that functions to produce essential metabolic compounds.
It was previously reported that several members of the Clp family of chaperones and proteases localize to the apicoplast.
In bacteria and in chloroplasts these proteins form complexes that degrade proteins in a proteasome-like manner to regulate key cellular processes, but their function in the apicoplast is completely unknown.
In this study, we generated a conditional mutant of the P. falciparum apicoplast-targeted pfclpc gene and found that under normal conditions it localizes to the apicoplast.
Knockdown of PfClpC results in growth inhibition and morphological defects, indicating that PfClpC is essential for parasite viability.
Upon inhibition, PfClpC loses its apicoplast localization and appears in vesicle-like structures.
Other apicoplast-targeted proteins also localize to these structures, suggesting that organelle integrity is compromised.
Addition of isopentynyl pyrophosphate completely rescued the growth inhibition, indicating that the only essential function of PfClpC is related to the apicoplast.
Moreover, cellular assays suggest that PfClpC inhibition interferes with the ability of the schizont-stage parasites to properly sort functional apicoplast organelles into daughter-merozoites.
These data show that PfClpC is an essential gene that functions to maintain apicoplast integrity.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe deadly human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, contains a unique organelle called the apicoplast, a non-photosynthetic plastid that produces vital metabolites.
Members of the prokaryotic-derived Clp family were previously reported to localize to the apicoplast.
In bacteria and plant chloroplasts, Clp homologs form a proteasome-like complex that degrade proteins but their function in parasite biology is unknown.
Here we took a conditional knockdown approach to study an apicoplast localized Clp proteins, PfClpC, which we found to be essential for parasite viability.
Inhibition of PfClpC results in a growth arrest phenotype that correlates with a reduced replication rate.
We observed that PfClpC localizes to the apicoplast, however upon inhibition it is found dispersed in vesicle-like structures suggesting a complete breakdown of organelle integrity.
Furthermore, we have found evidence supporting a role for PfClpC in apicoplast sorting into daughter cells.
Therefore, we propose PfClpC as a potential drug target due to its essentiality, prokaryotic origin and absence from the human host.

Natural diversity of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae  The sustainability of malaria control in Africa is threatened by rising levels of insecticide resistance, and new tools to prevent malaria transmission are urgently needed.
To gain a better understanding of the mosquito populations that transmit malaria, we sequenced the genomes of 765 wild specimens of Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii sampled from 15 locations across Africa.
The data reveal high levels of genetic diversity, with over 50 million single nucleotide polymorphisms across the 230 Mbp genome.
We observe complex patterns of population structure and marked variations in local population size, some of which may be due at least in part to malaria control interventions.
Insecticide resistance genes show strong signatures of recent selection associated with multiple independent mutations spreading over large geographical distances and between species.
The genetic variability of natural populations substantially reduces the target space for novel gene-drive strategies for mosquito control.
This large dataset provides a foundation for tracking the emergence and spread of insecticide resistance and developing new vector control tools.
MinorityReport, software for generalized analysis of causal genetic variants  BackgroundThe widespread availability of next generation genome sequencing technologies has enabled a wide range of variant detection applications, especially in cancer and inborn genetic disorders.
For model systems and microorganisms, the same technology may be used to discover the causative mutations for any phenotype, including those generated in response to chemical perturbation.
Specifically, MinorityReport relates mapped sequence reads in SAM format output from any alignment tool for both the mutant and parent genome, relative to a reference genome, and produces the set of variants that distinguishes the mutant from the parent, all presented in an intuitive, straightforward report format.
MinorityReport features tunable parameters for evaluating evidence and a scoring system that prioritizes reported variants based on relative proportions of read counts supporting the variant in the mutant versus parent data sets.
We demonstrate the utility of MinorityReport using publicly available data sets that we previously published to find the determinants of resistance for novel anti-malarial drugs.\n\nConclusionsMinorityReport is readily available (github: xxxxxxx) to identify the genetic mechanisms of drug resistance in plasmodium, genotype-phenotype relationships in human diads, or genomic variations between any two related organisms.
Phenoplasm: a database of disruption phenotypes for malaria parasite genes  Two decades from the first Plasmodium transfection, attempts have been made to disrupt more than 900 genes in malaria parasites, across five Plasmodium species.
While results from the rodent malarias have been curated and systematised, phenotypic data for species of human malaria parasites has existed only scattered across a large literature.
To facilitate systematic views of known experimental-genetic data across Plasmodium species, we have built PhenoPlasm (http://www.phenoplasm.org), a database of phenotypes for Plasmodium parasites.
The site provides a simple interface to link citation-backed Plasmodium reverse-genetic phenotypes to gene IDs.
The database has been populated with phenotypic data on 330 P. falciparum genes, curated from 155 individual publications, as well as existing curated data from RMgmDB.
These data are presented using 1: 1 ortholog mapping to allow a researcher interested in a gene in one species to see results across Plasmodium.
Single-cell transcriptomics of malaria parasites  Single-cell RNA-sequencing is revolutionising our understanding of seemingly homogeneous cell populations, but has not yet been applied to single cell organisms.
Here, we established a method to successfully investigate transcriptional variation across individual malaria parasites.
We discover an unexpected, discontinuous program of transcription during asexual growth previously masked by bulk analyses, and uncover novel variation among sexual stage parasites in their expression of gene families important in host-parasite interactions.
Ankyrin-1 gene exhibits allelic heterogeneity in conferring protection against malaria  Allelic heterogeneity is a common phenomenon where a gene exhibit different phenotype depending on the nature of its genetic mutations.
In the context of genes affecting malaria susceptibility, it allowed us to explore and understand the intricate host-parasite interactions during malaria infections.
In this study, we described a gene encoding erythrocytic ankyrin-1 (Ank-1) which exhibits allelic-dependent heterogeneous phenotypes during malaria infections.
We conducted an ENU mutagenesis screen on mice and identified two Ank-1 mutations, one resulted in an amino acid substitution (MRI95845), and the other a truncated Ank-1 protein (MRI96570).
Both mutations caused hereditary spherocytosis-like phenotypes and confer differing protection against Plasmodium chabaudi infections.
Upon further examination, the Ank-1(MRI96570) mutation was found to inhibit intra-erythrocytic parasite maturation, whereas Ank-1(MW95845) caused increased bystander erythrocyte clearance during infection.
This is the first description of allelic heterogeneity in ankyrin-1 from the direct comparison between two Ank-1 mutations.
Despite the lack of direct evidence from population studies, this data further supported the protective roles of ankyrin-1 mutations in conferring malaria protection.
Novel Plasmodium falciparum metabolic network reconstruction identifies shifts associated with clinical antimalarial resistance  BACKGROUNDMalaria remains a major public health burden and resistance has emerged to every antimalarial on the market, including the frontline drug artemisinin.
Our limited understanding of Plasmodium biology hinders the elucidation of resistance mechanisms.
In this regard, systems biology approaches can facilitate the integration of existing experimental knowledge and further understanding of these mechanisms.\n\nRESULTSHere, we developed a novel genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction, iPfal17, of the asexual blood-stage P. falciparum parasite to expand our understanding of metabolic changes that support resistance.
We identified 11 metabolic tasks to evaluate iPfal17 performance.
Flux balance analysis and simulation of gene knockouts and enzyme inhibition predict candidate drug targets unique to resistant parasites.
Moreover, integration of clinical parasite transcriptomes into the iPfal17 reconstruction reveals patterns associated with antimalarial resistance.
These results predict that artemisinin sensitive and resistant parasites differentially utilize scavenging and biosynthetic pathways for multiple essential metabolites including folate and polyamines, and others within the mitochondria.
Our findings are consistent with experimental literature, while generating novel hypotheses about artemisinin resistance and parasite biology.
We detect evidence that resistance parasites maintain greater metabolic flexibility, perhaps representing an incomplete transition to the metabolic state most appropriate for nutrient-rich blood.\n\nCONCLUSIONUsing this systems biology approach, we identify metabolic shifts that arise with or in support of the resistant phenotype.
This perspective allows us to more productively analyze and interpret clinical expression data for the identification of candidate drug targets for the treatment of resistant parasites.
Development Of Amplicon Deep Sequencing Markers And Data Analysis Pipeline For Genotyping Multi-Clonal Malaria Infections  Amplicon deep sequencing permits sensitive detection of minority clones and improves discriminatory power for genotyping multi-clone Plasmodium falciparum infections.
Targeted sequencing of molecular marker csp and novel marker cpmp was conducted in duplicate on mixtures of parasite culture strains and 37 field samples.
A protocol to multiplex up to 384 samples in a single sequencing run was applied.
Software \"HaplotypR\" was developed for data analysis.
Cpmp was highly diverse (He=0.96) in contrast to csp (He=0.57).
Minority clones were robustly detected if their frequency was >1%.
False haplotype calls owing to sequencing errors were observed below that threshold.
To reliably detect haplotypes at very low frequencies, experiments are best performed in duplicate and should aim for coverage of >10000 reads/amplicon.
When compared to length polymorphic marker msp2, highly multiplexed amplicon sequencing displayed greater sensitivity in detecting minority clones.
Sub-minute phosphoregulation of cell-cycle systems during Plasmodium gamete formation  Malaria parasites are protists of the genus Plasmodium, whose transmission to mosquitoes is initiated by the production of gametes.
Male gametogenesis is an extremely rapid process that is tightly controlled to produce eight flagellated microgametes from a single haploid gametocyte within 10 minutes after ingestion by a mosquito.
Regulation of the cell cycle is poorly understood in divergent eukaryotes like Plasmodium, where the highly synchronous response of gametocytes to defined chemical and physical stimuli from the mosquito has proved to be a powerful model to identify specific phosphorylation events critical for cell-cycle progression.
To reveal the wider network of phosphorylation signalling in a systematic and unbiased manner, we have measured a high-resolution time course of the phosphoproteome of P. berghei gametocytes during the first minute of gametogenesis.
The data show an extremely broad response in which distinct cell-cycle events such as initiation of DNA replication and mitosis are rapidly induced and simultaneously regulated.
We identify several protein kinases and phosphatases that are likely central in the gametogenesis signalling pathway and validate our analysis by investigating the phosphoproteomes of mutants in two of them, CDPK4 and SRPK1.
We show these protein kinases to have distinct influences over the phosphorylation of similar downstream targets that are consistent with their distinct cellular functions, which is revealed by a detailed phenotypic analysis of an SRPK1 mutant.
Together, the results show that key cell-cycle systems in Plasmodium undergo simultaneous and rapid phosphoregulation.
We demonstrate how a highly resolved time-course of dynamic phosphorylation events can generate deep insights into the unusual cell biology of a divergent eukaryote, which serves as a model for an important group of human pathogens.
Sub-minute phosphoregulation of cell-cycle systems during Plasmodium gamete formation revealed by a high-resolution time course  Malaria parasites are protists of the genus Plasmodium, whose transmission to mosquitoes is initiated by the production of gametes.
Male gametogenesis is an extremely rapid process that is tightly controlled to produce eight flagellated microgametes from a single haploid gametocyte within 10 minutes after ingestion by a mosquito.
Regulation of the cell cycle is poorly understood in divergent eukaryotes like Plasmodium, where the highly synchronous response of gametocytes to defined chemical and physical stimuli from the mosquito has proved to be a powerful model to identify specific phosphorylation events critical for cell-cycle progression.
To reveal the wider network of phosphorylation signalling in a systematic and unbiased manner, we have measured a high-resolution time course of the phosphoproteome of P. berghei gametocytes during the first minute of gametogenesis.
The data show an extremely broad response in which distinct cell-cycle events such as initiation of DNA replication and mitosis are rapidly induced and simultaneously regulated.
We identify several protein kinases and phosphatases that are likely central in the gametogenesis signalling pathway and validate our analysis by investigating the phosphoproteomes of mutants in two of them, CDPK4 and SRPK1.
We show these protein kinases to have distinct influences over the phosphorylation of similar downstream targets that are consistent with their distinct cellular functions, which is revealed by a detailed phenotypic analysis of an SRPK1 mutant.
Together, the results show that key cell-cycle systems in Plasmodium undergo simultaneous and rapid phosphoregulation.

Long-read assembly of the Aedes aegypti genome reveals the nature of heritable adaptive immunity sequences  The Aedes aegypti mosquito is a major vector for arboviruses including dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus.
Recent studies have implicated genomic endogenous viral elements (EVEs) derived from non-retroviral RNA viruses in insect immunity.
Because these elements are inserted into repetitive regions of the mosquito genome, their large-scale structure and organization with respect to other genomic elements has been difficult to resolve with short-read sequencing.
To better define the origin, diversity and biological role of EVEs, we employed single-molecule, real-time sequencing technology to generate a high quality, long-read assembly of the Ae.
aegypti-derived Aag2 cell line genome.
We leverage the quality and contiguity of this assembly to characterize the diversity and genomic context of EVEs in the genome of this important model system.
We find that EVEs in the Aag2 genome are acquired through recombination by LTR retrotransposons, and organize into larger loci (>50kbp) characterized by high LTR density.
These EVE containing loci are associated with increased transcription factor binding sight density and increased production of anti-genomic piRNAs.
We also detected piRNA processing corresponding to on-going viral infection.
This global view of EVEs and piRNA responses demonstrates the ubiquity and diversity of these heritable elements that define small-RNA mediated antiviral immunity in mosquitoes.

Dengue virus hijacks a noncanonical oxidoreductase function of a cellular oligosaccharyltransferase complex  Dengue virus (DENV) is the most common arboviral infection globally, infecting an estimated 390 million people each year.
We employed a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify host dependency factors required for DENV propagation, and identified the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex as an essential host factor for DENV infection.
Mammalian cells express two OSTs containing either STT3A or STT3B.
We found that the canonical catalytic function of the OSTs as oligosaccharyltransferases is not necessary for DENV infection, as cells expressing catalytically inactive STT3A or STT3B are able to support DENV propagation.
However, the OST subunit MAGT1, which associates with STT3B, is also required for DENV propagation.
MAGT1 expression requires STT3B, and a catalytically inactive STT3B also rescues MAGT1 expression, supporting the hypothesis that STT3B serves to stabilize MAGT1 in the context of DENV infection.
We found that the oxidoreductase CxxC active site motif of MAGT1 was necessary for DENV propagation as cells expressing an AxxA MAGT1 mutant were unable to support DENV infection.\n\nInterestingly, cells expressing single-cysteine CxxA or AxxC mutants of MAGT1 were able to support DENV propagation.
Utilizing the engineered peroxidase APEX2, we demonstrate the close proximity between MAGT1 and NS1 or NS4B during DENV infection.
These results reveal that the oxidoreductase activity of the STT3B-containing OST is necessary for DENV infection, which may guide the development of antivirals targeting DENV.
Inferring Genetic Interactions From Comparative Fitness Data  AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDarwinian fitness is a central concept in evolutionary biology.
Here, we present quantitative tools to make inferences about epistatic gene interactions when the fitness landscape is only incompletely determined due to imprecise measurements or missing observations.
We demonstrate that genetic interactions can often be inferred from fitness rank orders, where all genotypes are ordered according to fitness, and even from partial fitness orders.
We provide a complete characterization of rank orders that imply higher order epistasis.
Our theory applies to all common types of gene interactions and facilitates comprehensive investigations of diverse genetic interactions.
We analyzed various genetic systems comprising HIV-1, the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium vivax, the fungus Aspergillus niger, and the TEM-family of {beta}-lactamase associated with antibiotic resistance.
For all systems, our approach revealed higher order interactions among mutations.
KCC1 Activation protects Mice from the Development of Experimental Cerebral Malaria.
Plasmodium falciparum malaria causes half a million deaths per year, with up to 9% of this mortality caused by cerebral malaria (CM).
One of the major processes contributing to the development of CM is an excess of host inflammatory cytokines.
Recently K+ signaling has emerged as an important mediator of the inflammatory response to infection; we therefore investigated whether mice carrying an ENU induced activation of the electroneutral K+ channel KCC1 had an altered response to Plasmodium berghei.
Here we show that Kcc1M935K/M935K mice are protected from the development of experimental cerebral malaria, and that this protection is associated with an increased CD4+ T cells and TNF- response.
This is the first description of a K+ channel affecting the development of experimental cerebral malaria.
hmmIBD: software to infer pairwise identity by descent between haploid genotypes  SummaryWe introduce hmmIBD, software to estimate pairwise identity by decent between haploid genomes, such as those of the malaria parasite, sampled from one or more populations.
We verified hmmIBD using simulated data, benchmarked it against a previously published method for detecting IBD within populations, and demonstrated its utility using Plasmodium falciparum data from Cambodia and Ghana.\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data include Appendices S1, S2 and S3, and are available online.\n\nAvailability and ImplemetationSource code written in C99/C11-compliant C and requiring no external libraries, is freely available for download at https://github.com/glipsnort/hmmIBD/releases, alongside test datasets.\n\nContactsfs@broadinstitute.org
Influential parameters for the analysis of intracellular parasite metabolomics  Metabolomics is increasingly popular for the study of many pathogens.
For the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, both targeted and untargeted metabolite detection has improved our understanding of pathogenesis, host-parasite interactions, and antimalarial drug treatment and resistance.
However, purification and analysis procedures for performing metabolomics on intracellular pathogens have not been explored.
We purified in vitro grown ring stage intra-erythrocytic P. falciparum parasites for untargeted metabolomics studies; the small size of this developmental stage amplifies the challenges associated with metabolomics studies as the ratio between host and parasite biomass is maximized.
We conclude that normalization parameters have large effects on differential abundance analysis and recommend the thoughtful selection of these parameters.
However, normalization does not remove the contribution from the parasites extracellular environment (culture media and host erythrocyte).
In fact, we found that extra-parasite material is as influential on the metabolome as treatment with a potent antimalarial drug with known metabolic effects (artemisinin).
Instead, we identified metabolites predictive of host and media contamination that can be used to assess sample purification.

Quantification of anti-parasite and anti-disease immunity to malaria as a function of age and exposure  Malaria immunity is complex and multi-faceted, and fundamental gaps remain in our understanding of how it develops.
Here, we use detailed clinical and entomological data from three parallel cohort studies conducted across the malaria transmission spectrum in Uganda to quantify the development of immunity against symptomatic Plasmodium falciparum as a function of age and transmission intensity.
We focus on: anti-parasite immunity (i.e; ability to control parasite densities) and anti-disease immunity (i.e; ability to tolerate higher parasite densities without fever).
They also show a non-linear effect of transmission intensity, where children experiencing the lowest transmission appear to develop immunity faster than those experiencing higher transmission.
These findings illustrate how anti-parasite and anti-disease immunity develop in parallel, reducing the probability of experiencing symptomatic malaria upon each subsequent P. falciparum infection.
Single-cell transcriptional dynamics of flavivirus infection  Dengue and Zika viral infections affect millions of people annually and can be complicated by hemorrhage or neurological manifestations, respectively.
However, a thorough understanding of the host response to these viruses is lacking, partly because conventional approaches ignore heterogeneity in virus abundance across cells.
We present viscRNA-Seq (virus-inclusive single cell RNA-Seq), an approach to probe the host transcriptome together with intracellular viral RNA at the single cell level.
We applied viscRNA-Seq to monitor dengue and Zika virus infection in cultured cells and discovered extreme heterogeneity in virus abundance.
We validated the viscRNA-Seq hits and discovered novel proviral and antiviral factors.
viscRNA-Seq is a powerful approach to assess the genome-wide virus-host dynamics at single cell level.
Field evidence for manipulation of mosquito host selection by the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum  Whether the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum can manipulate mosquito host choice in ways that enhance parasite transmission toward humans is unknown.
We assessed the influence of P. falciparum on the blood-feeding behaviour of three of its major vectors (Anopheles coluzzii, An.
gambiae and An.
Host preference assays using odour-baited traps revealed no effect of infection on mosquito long-range anthropophily.
However, the identification of the blood meal origin of mosquitoes showed that females carrying sporozoites, the mature transmissible stage of the parasite, displayed a 24% increase in anthropophagy compared to both females harbouring oocysts, the parasite immature stage, and uninfected individuals.
Using a mathematical model, we further showed that this increased anthropophagy in infectious females resulted in a > 250% increase in parasite transmission potential, everything else being equal.
Exploring Single-Cell Data with Deep Multitasking Neural Networks  Biomedical researchers are generating high-throughput, high-dimensional single-cell data at a staggering rate.
As costs of data generation decrease, experimental design is moving towards measurement of many different single-cell samples in the same dataset.
While scalability of methods to datasets of these sizes is a challenge on its own, dealing with large-scale experimental design presents a whole new set of problems, including batch effects and sample comparison issues.
Currently, there are no computational tools that can both handle large amounts of data in a scalable manner (many cells) and at the same time deal with many samples (many patients or conditions).
Moreover, data analysis currently involves the use of different tools that each operate on their own data representation, not guaranteeing a synchronized analysis pipeline.
For instance, data visualization methods can be disjoint and mismatched with the clustering method.
For this purpose, we present SAUCIE, a deep neural network that leverages the high degree of parallelization and scalability offered by neural networks, as well as the deep representation of data that can be learned by them to perform many single-cell data analysis tasks, all on a unified representation.\n\nA well-known limitation of neural networks is their interpretability.
We show this capability by analyzing a newly generated 180-sample dataset consisting of T cells from dengue patients in India, measured with mass cytometry.
We show that SAUCIE, for the first time, can batch correct and process this 11-million cell data to identify cluster-based signatures of acute dengue infection and create a patient manifold, stratifying immune response to dengue on the basis of single-cell measurements.

Improved Aedes aegypti mosquito reference genome assembly enables biological discovery and vector control  Female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infect hundreds of millions of people each year with dangerous viral pathogens including dengue, yellow fever, Zika, and chikungunya.
Here we combine diverse genome technologies to produce AaegL5, a dramatically improved and annotated assembly, and demonstrate how it accelerates mosquito science and control.
We anchored the physical and cytogenetic maps, resolved the size and composition of the elusive sex-determining \"M locus\", significantly increased the known members of the glutathione-S-transferase genes important for insecticide resistance, and doubled the number of chemosensory ionotropic receptors that guide mosquitoes to human hosts and egg-laying sites.
Using high-resolution QTL and population genomic analyses, we mapped new candidates for dengue vector competence and insecticide resistance.
We predict that AaegL5 will catalyse new biological insights and intervention strategies to fight this deadly arboviral vector.
PlasmoTron: an open-source platform for automated culture of malaria parasites  We have created a system which allows an inexpensive open-source liquid-handling robot to automate major aspects of malaria parasite culture.
Parasites are cultured in multi-well microplates, with their details recorded in a database.
We show that the system is capable of raising cultures after transfection, and then maintaining them at desired parasitaemias.
Using paired serology and surveillance data to quantify dengue transmission and control during a large outbreak in Fiji  Dengue is a major health burden, but it can be challenging to examine transmission dynamics and evaluate control measures because outbreaks depend on multiple factors, including human population structure, prior immunity and climate.
We combined population-representative paired sera collected before and after the major 2013/14 dengue-3 outbreak in Fiji with surveillance data to determine how such factors influence dengue virus transmission and control in island settings.
Our results suggested the 10-19 year-old age group had the highest risk of acquiring infection, but we did not find strong evidence that other demographic or environmental risk factors were linked to seroconversion.
Mathematical modelling showed that temperature-driven variation in transmission and herd immunity could not fully explain observed dynamics.
SUCCESSIVE BLOODMEALS ENHANCE VIRUS DISSEMINATION WITHIN MOSQUITOES AND INCREASE TRANSMISSION POTENTIAL  SUMMARY PARAGRAPHThe recent Zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) epidemics highlight the explosive nature of arthropod-borne (arbo) viruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes1,2.
Vector competence and the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) are two key entomological parameters used to assess the public health risk posed by arboviruses3.
These are typically measured empirically by offering mosquitoes an infectious bloodmeal and temporally sampling mosquitoes to determine infection and transmission status.
This approach has been used for the better part of a century; however, it does not accurately capture the biology and behavior of many mosquito vectors which refeed frequently (every 2-3 days)4.
Here we demonstrate that administration of a second non-infectious bloodmeal significantly shortens the EIP of ZIKV-infected Ae.
aegypti by enhancing virus escape from the mosquito midgut.
Similarly, a second bloodmeal increased the competence of this species for dengue virus and CHIKV.
This effect was also observed for ZIKV in Aedes albopictus, suggesting that this species might be a more important vector than once thought and that this phenomenon may be common among other virus-vector pairings.
Modeling of these findings reveals that a shortened EIP would result in a significant increase in the basic reproductive number, R0.
This increase helps explain how Ae.aegypti can sustain an explosive epidemic like ZIKV despite its relatively poor vector competence in single-feed laboratory trials.
Evolution of subgenomic RNA shapes dengue virus adaptation and epidemiological fitness  Genetic changes in the dengue virus (DENV) genome affects viral fitness both clinically and epidemiologically.
Even in the 3 untranslated region (3UTR), mutations could impact the formation of subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA) and the specificity of sfRNA in inhibiting host proteins necessary for successful viral replication.
Indeed, we have recently shown that mutations in the 3UTR of DENV2 affected its ability to inhibit TRIM25 E3 ligase activity to reduce interferon (IFN) expression, which potentially contributed to the emergence of a new viral clade during the 1994 dengue epidemic in Puerto Rico.
However, whether differences in 3UTRs shaped DENV evolution on a larger scale remains incompletely understood.
Herein, we combined RNA phylogeny with phylogenetics to gain insights on sfRNA evolution.
We found that sfRNA structures are under purifying selection and highly conserved despite sequence divergence.
Interestingly, only the second flaviviral Nuclease-resistant RNA (fNR2) structure of DENV-2 has undergone strong positive selection.
Epidemiological reports also suggest that nucleotide substitutions in fNR2 may drive DENV-2 epidemiological fitness, possibly through sfRNA-protein interactions.
Collectively, our findings indicate that 3UTRs are important determinants of DENV fitness in human-mosquito cycles.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDengue viruses (DENV) preserve RNA elements in their 3 untranslated region (UTR).\nC_LIO_LISite-specific quantification of natural selection revealed positive selection on DENV2 sfRNA.\nC_LIO_LIFlaviviral nuclease-resistant RNA (fNR) structures in DENV 3UTRs contribute to DENV speciation.\nC_LIO_LIA highly evolving fNR structure appears to increase DENV-2 epidemiological fitness.\nC_LI
Detection of Plasmodium berghei infected Anopheles stephensi using near-infrared spectroscopy  BackgroundThe proportion of mosquitoes infected with malaria is an important entomological metric used to assess the intensity of transmission and the impact of vector control interventions.
Currently the prevalence of mosquitoes with salivary gland sporozoites is estimated by dissecting mosquitoes under a microscope or using molecular methods.
This study evaluates the potential of near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS) to identify laboratory reared mosquitoes infected with rodent malaria.\n\nMethodsAnopheles stephensi mosquitoes were reared in the laboratory and fed on Plasmodium berghei infected blood.
After 12 and 21 days post-feeding mosquitoes were killed, scanned and analysed using NIRS and immediately dissected by microscopy to determine the number of oocysts on the midgut wall or sporozoites in the salivary glands.
A predictive classification model was used to determine parasite prevalence and intensity status from spectra.\n\nResultsThe predictive model correctly classifies infectious and uninfectious mosquitoes with an overall accuracy of 72%.
The false negative and false positive rates are, respectively, 30% and 26%.
While NIRS was able to differentiate between uninfectious and highly infectious mosquitoes, differentiating between mid-range infectious groups was less accurate.
Multiple scans of the same specimen, with repositioning the mosquito between scans, is shown to improve accuracy.
On a smaller dataset NIRS was unable to predict whether mosquitoes harboured oocysts.\n\nConclusionsWe provide the first evidence that NIRS can differentiate between infectious and uninfectious mosquitoes.
Currently the method has moderate accuracy and distinguishing between different intensities of infection is challenging.
The classification model provides a flexible framework and allows for different error rates to be optimised, enabling the sensitivity and specificity of the technique to be varied according to requirements.
NK cells inhibit Plasmodium falciparum growth in red blood cells via antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity  Antibodies acquired naturally through repeated exposure to Plasmodium falciparum are essential in the control of blood-stage malaria.
A role of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by natural killer (NK) cells in protection from malaria has not been established.
Here we show that IgG isolated from adults living in a malaria-endemic region activated ADCC by primary human NK cells, which lysed infected red blood cells (RBCs) and inhibited parasite growth in an in vitro assay for ADCC-dependent growth inhibition.
RBC lysis by NK cells was highly selective for infected RBCs in a mixed culture with uninfected RBCs.
Human antibodies to P. falciparum antigens PfEMP1 and RIFIN were sufficient to promote NK-dependent growth inhibition.
Heterogeneous exposure and hotspots for malaria vectors at three study sites in Uganda  Heterogeneity in malaria transmission has household, temporal, and spatial components.
These factors are relevant for improving the efficiency of malaria control by targeting heterogeneity.
To quantify variation, we analyzed mosquito counts from entomological surveillance conducted at three study sites in Uganda that varied in malaria transmission intensity.
Using a Bayesian zero-inflated negative binomial model, validated via a comprehensive simulation study, we quantified household differences in malaria exposure and examined its spatial distribution.
We found that housing quality explained large variation among households in mosquito counts.
We also found some differences in the hotspots in rainy vs. dry seasons or before vs. after control.
We also found some differences in the hotspots in rainy vs. dry seasons or before vs. after control.
This work identified methods for quantifying heterogeneity in malaria exposure and offered a critical evaluation of spatially targeting interventions at malaria hotspots.
Longitudinal tracking of Plasmodium falciparum clones in complex infections by amplicon deep sequencing  BackgroundLongitudinal tracking of individual Plasmodium falciparum strains in multi-clonal infections is essential for investigating infection dynamics of malaria.
The traditional genotyping techniques did not permit tracking changes in individual clone density during persistent natural infections.
Amplicon deep sequencing (Amp-Seq) offers a tool to address this knowledge gap.\n\nMethodsThe sensitivity of Amp-Seq for relative quantification of clones was investigated using three molecular markers, ama1-D2, ama1-D3, and cpmp.
Amp-Seq and length-polymorphism based genotyping were compared for their performance in following minority clones in longitudinal samples from Papua New Guinea.\n\nResultsAmp-Seq markers were superior to length-polymorphic marker msp2 in detecting minority clones (sensitivity Amp-Seq: 95%, msp2: 85%).
Multiplicity of infection (MOI) by Amp-Seq was 2.32 versus 1.73 for msp2.
The higher sensitivity had no effect on estimates of force of infection because missed minority clones were detected in preceding or succeeding bleeds.
Individual clone densities were tracked longitudinally by Amp-Seq despite MOI>1, thus providing an additional parameter for investigating malaria infection dynamics.\n\nConclusionAmp-Seq based genotyping of longitudinal samples improves detection of minority clones and estimates of MOI.
Amp-Seq permits tracking of clone density over time to study clone competition or the dynamics of specific, i.e.
resistance-associated genotypes.
Evaluation of current and emerging anti-malarial medicines for inhibition of Toxoplasma gondii growth in vitro  Toxoplasma gondii is a common zoonotic infection of humans and estimates indicate that 1-2 billion people are chronically infected.
Current therapies for toxoplasmosis only control acute infection caused by actively proliferating tachyzoites but do not eradicate the chronic tissue cyst stages.
As well, there are considerable adverse side effects of the most commonly used therapy of combined sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine.
Targeting the folate pathway is also an effective treatment for malaria, caused by the related parasites Plasmodium spp., suggesting common agents might be used to treat both infections.
Here we evaluated currently approved and newly emerging medicines for malaria to determine if such compounds might also prove useful for treating toxoplasmosis.
Surprisingly, the majority of anti-malarial compounds being used currently or in development for treatment of malaria were only modestly effective at inhibiting in vitro growth of T. gondii tachyzoites.
These findings suggest that many essential processes in P. falciparum that are targeted by anti-malarial compounds are either divergent, or non-essential in T. gondii, thus limiting options for repurposing of current antimalarial medicines for toxoplasmosis.

A community-level investigation of the yellow fever virus outbreak in South Omo Zone, South-West Ethiopia, 2012-2014  BackgroundA yellow fever (YF) outbreak occurred in South Omo Zone, Ethiopia in 2012-2014.
This study aimed to analyse historical epidemiological data, to assess the risk for future YF outbreaks through entomological surveillance, including mosquito species identification and molecular screening for arboviruses, and finally to determine the knowledge, attitudes and current preventative practices within the affected communities.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsFrom October 2012 to March 2014, 165 cases and 62 deaths were reported, principally in rural areas of South Ari region (83.6%), south-west Ethiopia.
The majority of patients were 15-44 years old (74.5%) and most case deaths were males (76%).
Between June and August 2017, 688 containers were sampled from across 177 households to identify key breeding sites for Aedes mosquitoes.
Ensete ventricosum (\"false banana\") was identified as the primary natural breeding site, and clay pots outside the home as the most productive artificial breeding site.
Entomological risk indices from the majority of sites were classified as \"high risk\" for future outbreaks under current World Health Organization criteria.
Adult trapping resulted in the identification of members of the Aedes simpsoni complex in and around households.
Screening of adult females revealed no detection of yellow fever virus (YFV) or other arboviruses.
88% of 177 participants had heard of YF, however many participants easily confused transmission and symptoms of YF with malaria, which is also endemic in the area.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceStudy results emphasise the need for further entomological studies to improve our understanding of local vector species and transmission dynamics.
Disease surveillance systems and in-country laboratory capacity also need to be strengthened to facilitate more rapid responses to future YF outbreaks.\n\nAuthor SummaryDespite the availability of a highly effective vaccine, yellow fever virus (YFV) remains an important public health problem across Africa and South America due to its high case-fatality rate.
During this study, historical data analysis was conducted to understand the epidemiology of the recent outbreak in 2012-2014.
Entomological surveillance was also carried out, including both mosquito species identification and molecular screening for arboviruses, as well as a household survey to understand the knowledge and attitudes towards yellow fever (YF) within the affected areas and to assess community-level practices for YF prevention.
We found a high abundance of Aedes simpsoni complex in the context of low vaccination coverage.
The genetic architecture of target-site resistance to pyrethroid insecticides in the African malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii  Resistance to pyrethroid insecticides is a major concern for malaria vector control, because these are the compounds used in almost all insecticide-treated bed-nets (ITNs), and are also widely used for indoor residual spraying (IRS).
Pyrethroids target the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC), an essential component of the mosquito nervous system, but substitutions in the amino acid sequence can disrupt the activity of these insecticides, inducing a resistance phenotype.
Here we use Illumina whole-genome sequence data from phase 1 of the Anopheles gambiae 1000 Genomes Project (Ag1000G) to provide a comprehensive account of genetic variation in the Vgsc gene in mosquito populations from eight African countries.
In addition to the three known resistance alleles, we describe 20 non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions at appreciable frequency in one or more populations that are previously unknown in Anopheles mosquitoes.
Thirteen of these novel alleles were found to occur almost exclusively on haplotypes carrying the known L995F resistance allele (L1014F in Musca domesticus codon numbering), and may enhance or compensate for the L995F resistance pheno-type.
A novel mutation I1527T, which is adjacent to a predicted pyrethroid binding site, was found in tight linkage with either of two alleles causing a V402L substitution, similar to a combination of substitutions found to cause pyrethroid resistance in several other insect species.
We analyse the genetic backgrounds on which non-synonymous alleles are found, to determine which alleles have experienced recent positive selection, and to refine our understanding of the spread of resistance between species and geographical locations.
We describe twelve distinct haplotype groups with evidence of recent positive selection, five of which carry the known L995F resistance allele, five of which carry the known L995S resistance allele, one of which carries the novel I1527T allele, and one of which carries a novel M490I allele.
Seven of these groups are localised to a single geographical location, and five comprise haplotypes from different countries, in one case separated by over 3000 km, providing new information about the geographical distribution and spread of resistance.
We also find evidence for multiple introgression events transmitting resistance alleles between An.
gambiae and An.
We identify markers that could be used to design high-throughput, low-cost genetic assays for improved surveillance of pyrethroid resistance in the field.
Our results demonstrate that the molecular basis of target-site pyrethroid resistance in malaria vectors is more complex than previously appreciated, and provide a foundation for the development of new genetic tools to track the spread insecticide resistance and improve the design of strategies for insecticide resistance management.
CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to make conditional mutants of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum  Malaria is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.
This disease, which primarily affects those living in tropical and subtropical regions, is caused by infection with Plasmodium parasites.
The development of better drugs to combat malaria can be accelerated by improving our understanding of the biology of this complex parasite.
Genetic manipulation of these parasites is key to understanding their biology, but historically, the genome of P. falciparum has been difficult to manipulate.
Recently, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has been utilized in malaria parasites, allowing for easier protein tagging, generation of conditional protein knockdowns, and deletion of genes.
CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has proven to be a powerful tool for advancing the field of malaria research.
Here, we describe a CRISPR/Cas9 method for generating glmS-based conditional knockdown mutants in P. falciparum.
The method is highly adaptable to other types of genetic manipulations, including protein tagging and gene knockouts.
Quantification of dengue virus specific T cell responses and correlation with viral load and clinical disease severity in acute dengue infection  BackgroundIn order to understand the role of dengue virus (DENV) specific T cell responses that associate with protection, we studied their frequency and phenotype in relation to clinical disease severity and resolution of viraemia in a large cohort of patients with varying severity of acute dengue infection.\n\nMethodology/Principal findingsUsing ex vivo IFN{gamma} ELISpot assays we determined the frequency of dengue viral peptide (DENV)-NS3, NS1 and NS5 responsive T cells in 74 adult patients with acute dengue infection and examined the association of responsive T cell frequency with the extent of viraemia and clinical disease severity.
We found that total DENV-specific and DENV-NS3-specific T cell responses, were higher in patients with dengue fever (DF), when compared to those with dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF).
In addition, early appearance of DENV-specific T cell responses was significantly associated with milder clinical disease (p=0.02).
DENV peptide specific T cell responses inversely correlated with the degree of viraemia, which was most significant for DENV-NS3 specific T cell responses (Spearmans r = -0.47, p=0.0003).
The frequency of T cell responses to NS1, NS5 and pooled DENV peptides, correlated with the degree of thrombocytopenia but had no association with levels of liver transaminases.
In contrast, DENV-IgG inversely correlated with the degree of thrombocytopenia and levels of liver transaminases.\n\nConclusions/significanceEarly appearance of DENV-specific T cell IFN{gamma} responses appears to associate with milder clinical disease and resolution of viraemia, suggesting a protective role in acute dengue infection.
Emergence of a Dengue virus serotype 2 causing the largest ever dengue epidemic in Sri Lanka  BackgroundSri Lanka experienced the largest ever dengue outbreak in year 2017, which coincided with the shift of the predominant circulating dengue virus (DENV) 1 to DENV2 after 9 years.
As it was felt that more patients appeared to develop complications and severe dengue, we compared clinical features of patients with acute dengue, with the previous circulating serotype (DENV1) and also sequenced the new virus, to determine the lineage of the virus.\n\nMethodology/Principal findingsWe studied the clinical and laboratory features of 172 adult patients with acute DENV1 (n=79) and DENV2 (n=93) infection.
65 (82.3%) of those with DENV1 and 86 (92.4%) of those with DENV2 were experiencing a secondary infection.
The risk of developing dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) was significantly higher (=0.005, odds ratio=2.5) in those infected with DENV2 (54.8%) when compared to DENV1(32.9%), even though similar proportions of patients had a secondary dengue infection.
Patients with DENV2 infection developed leakage significantly earlier (p<0.0001, median= 3, days) when compared to those with a DENV1 infection (median 5 days) and were more likely to develop significant bleeding and to require blood transfusions.
Furthermore, patients with DENV2 were more likely to have significantly lower platelet counts during day 3, 4 and 5 since onset of illness.\n\nWhole genome sequencing showed that these DENV-2 isolates belonged to a cosmopolitan strain and was genetically more distant than the DENV-2 strains that circulated from 1981 to 2004 in Sri Lanka.\n\nConclusions/significanceSince this DENV2 strain appears to cause more severe forms of clinical disease, it would be important to determine variations in the virus genome or other factors that could have contributed to severe disease.\n\nAuthor summarySri Lanka experienced the largest ever dengue outbreak in year 2017, which coincided with the shift of the predominant circulating dengue virus (DENV) 1 to DENV2 after 9 years.

Heterogeneous timing of asexual cycles in Plasmodium falciparum quantified by extended time-lapse microscopy  Malarial fever arises from the synchronous bursting of human red blood cells by the Plasmodium parasite.
The released parasites re-infect neighboring red blood cells and undergo another asexual cycle of differentiation and proliferation for 48 hours, before again bursting synchronously.
The synchrony of bursting is lost during in vitro culturing of the parasite outside the human body, presumably because the asexual cycle is no longer entrained by host-specific circadian cues.
Therefore, most in vitro malaria studies have relied on the artificial synchronization of the parasite population.
However, much remains unknown about the degree of timing heterogeneity of asexual cycles and how artificial synchronization may affect this timing.
Here, we combined time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and long-term culturing to follow single cells and directly measure the heterogeneous timing of in vitro asexual cycles.
We first demonstrate that unsynchronized laboratory cultures are not fully asynchronous and the parasites exhibit a bimodal distribution in their first burst times.
We then show that synchronized and unsynchronized cultures had similar asexual cycle periods, which indicates that artificial synchronization does not fundamentally perturb asexual cycle dynamics.
Last, we demonstrate that sibling parasites descended from the same schizont exhibited significant variation in asexual cycle period, although smaller than the variation between non-siblings.
The additional variance between non-siblings likely arises from the variable environments and/or developmental programs experienced in different host cells.
Endothelial Protein C Receptor Contributes to Experimental Malaria-Associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome  The severity of Plasmodium falciparum malaria is associated with parasite cytoadherence, but there is limited knowledge about the effect of parasite cytoadherence in malaria-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Our objective was to evaluate the cytoadherence of infected red blood cells (iRBCs) in a murine model of ARDS and to appraise a potential function of endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) in ARDS pathogenesis.
DBA/2 mice infected with P. berghei ANKA were classified as ARDS- or hyperparasitemia (HP)-developing mice according to respiratory parameters and parasitemia.
Lungs, blood and bronchoalveolar lavage were collected for gene expression or protein analyses.
Primary cultures of microvascular lung endothelial cells from DBA/2 mice were analyzed for iRBC interactions.
Lungs from ARDS-developing mice showed evidence of iRBC accumulation along with an increase in EPCR and TNF concentrations.
Furthermore, TNF increased iRBC adherence in vitro.
Dexamethasone-treated infected mice showed low levels of TNF and EPCR mRNA expression and, finally, decreased vascular permeability, thus protecting mice from ARDS.
In conclusion, we identified that increased iRBC cytoadherence in the lungs underlies malaria-associated ARDS in DBA/2-infected mice and that inflammation increased cytoadherence capacity, suggesting a participation of EPCR and a conceivable target for drug development.

Plasmodium male gametocyte development and transmission are critically regulated by general and transmission-specific members of the CAF1/CCR4/NOT complex  With relatively few known specific transcription factors to control the abundance of specific mRNAs, Plasmodium parasites also regulate the stability and turnover of transcripts to provide more comprehensive gene regulation.
Plasmodium transmission stages impose translational repression on specific transcripts in part to accomplish this.
However, few proteins are known to participate in this process, and those that are characterized primarily affect female gametocytes.
We have identified and characterized PyCCR4-1, a putative deadenylase, which plays a role in the development and activation of male gametocytes, regulates the abundance of specific mRNAs in gametocytes, and ultimately increases the efficiency of host-to-vector transmission.
We find that when pyccr4-1 is deleted or its protein made catalytically inactive, there is a loss in the initial coordination of male gametocyte maturation and a reduction of parasite infectivity of the mosquito.
Comparative RNA-seq revealed that PyCCR4-1 affects transcripts important for transmission-related functions that are associated with male or female gametocytes, some of which directly associate with the immunoprecipitated complex.
Finally, circular RT-PCR of one of the bound, dysregulated transcripts showed that PyCCR4-1 does not have gross changes in UTR or poly(A) tail length.
We conclude that general and transmission-specialized members of the CAF1/CCR4/NOT complex play critical and intertwined roles in gametocyte maturation and transmission.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMalaria is a disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, which are transmitted during an infectious blood meal by anopheline mosquitoes.
Transmission of the sexual stages of the parasite to mosquitoes requires the proper regulation of specific mRNAs.
Here, we demonstrate that PyCCR4-1, a member of the CAF1/CCR4/NOT RNA metabolic complex, acts upon transcripts both directly and indirectly in both male and female parasites, and results in a reduction of male gametocytemia.
In gametocytes lacking PyCCR4-1, as well as those expressing a catalytically dead variant, the initial coordinated wave of male gametocyte activation is lost, and these parasites are less able to productively infect mosquitoes.
We find that PyCCR4-1 requires its association with PyCAF1 and by proxy, the rest of the complex, in order to perform its functions based upon experiments in both Plasmodium yoelii and Plasmodium falciparum.
We also find that the CAF1/CCR4/NOT complex is directly binding some of these transcripts and is likely acting both directly and indirectly to modulate transcript abundance.
These findings demonstrate that the combined effects of the CAF1/CCR4/NOT complex upon specific mRNAs are important for both male and female gametocytes, and that this regulation is required for efficient transmission to the mosquito vector.
The acidic domain of the hepatitis C virus NS4A protein is required for viral assembly and envelopment through interactions with the viral E1 glycoprotein  Hepatitis C virus (HCV) assembly and envelopment are coordinated by a complex protein interaction network that includes most of the viral structural and nonstructural proteins.
While the nonstructural protein 4A (NS4A) is known to be important for viral particle production, the specific function of NS4A in this process is not well understood.
We performed mutagenesis of the C-terminal acidic domain of NS4A and found that mutation of several of these amino acids prevented the formation of the viral envelope, and therefore the production of infectious virions, without affecting viral RNA replication.
In an overexpression system, we found that NS4A interacted with several viral proteins known to coordinate envelopment, including the viral E1 glycoprotein.
One of the NS4A C-terminal mutations, Y45F, disrupted the interaction of NS4A with E1.
Specifically, NS4A interacted with the first hydrophobic region of E1, a region previously described as regulating viral particle production.
Supernatants from HCV NS4A Y45F transfected cells had significantly reduced levels of HCV RNA, however they contained equivalent levels of Core protein.
Interestingly, the Core protein secreted from these cells formed high order oligomers with a density matching the infectious virus secreted from WT cells.
These results suggest that this Y45F mutation in NS4A causes secretion of low density Core particles devoid of genomic HCV RNA.
These results corroborate previous findings showing that mutation of the first hydrophobic region of E1 also causes secretion of Core complexes lacking RNA, and therefore suggest that the interaction between NS4A and E1 is involved in the incorporation of viral RNA into infectious HCV particles.
Our findings define a new role for NS4A in the HCV lifecycle and help elucidate the protein interactions necessary for production of infectious virus.\n\nAuthor SummaryRNA viruses, which encompass both established and emerging pathogens, pose significant public health challenges.
Viruses in the family Flavivirdae, including Dengue virus, Zika virus and hepatitis C virus (HCV), continue to cause morbidity and mortality worldwide.
One HCV protein, NS4A, has known functions in several steps of the viral lifecycle, however, how it contributes to viral particle production is not understood.
NS4A interacts with the first hydrophobic domain of E1.
Disruption of this interaction prevents the production of infectious virus particles and instead results in release of low density Core protein complexes that lack HCV RNA into the cellular supernatant.
Overall, our results reveal that NS4A is important for late stages of the HCV lifecycle and suggest that the interaction between NS4A and E1 may regulate the incorporation of viral RNA into the virion for the formation of infectious HCV particles.
An epitope-resurfaced virus-like particle can induce broad neutralizing antibody against four serotypes of dengue virus  Dengue fever is caused by four different serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) which is the leading cause of worldwide arboviral diseases in humans.
Virus-like particles (VLPs) containing flavivirus prM/E proteins have been demonstrated to be a potential vaccine candidate; however, the structure of dengue VLP is poorly understood.
Herein we show for the first time that mD2VLP particles possess a T=1 icosahedral symmetry with a groove located within the E-protein dimers near the 2-fold vertices that exposed highly overlapping, cryptic neutralizing epitopes through cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction.
Mice vaccinated with highly matured virus-like particles derived from DENV serotype 2 (mD2VLP) can generate higher cross reactive (CR) neutralization antibodies (NtAbs) and were protected against all 4 serotypes of DENV through clonal expansion supported by hybridoma and B-cell repertoire analysis.
Our results revealed that a \"epitope-resurfaced\" mature-form dengue VLP has the potential to induce quaternary structure-recognizing broad CR NtAbs.
Plasmodium-specific atypical memory B cells are not part of the long-lived memory response  A subset of atypical memory B cells accumulates in malaria and several infections, autoimmune disorders and aging in both humans and mice.
It has been suggested these cells are exhausted long-lived memory B cells, and their accumulation may contribute to poor acquisition of long-lasting immunity to certain chronic infections, such as malaria and HIV.
Here, we generated an immunoglobulin heavy chain knock-in mouse with a BCR that recognizes MSP1 of the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium chabaudi.
In combination with a mosquito-initiated P. chabaudi infection, we show that Plasmodium-specific atypical memory B cells are short-lived and disappear upon natural resolution of chronic infection.
Our data demonstrate that Plasmodium-specific atypical memory B cells are not a subset of long-lived memory B cells, but rather short-lived activated cells, and part of a physiologic ongoing B-cell response.
Assessment of Metagenomic MinION and Illumina sequencing as an approach for the recovery of whole genome sequences of chikungunya and dengue viruses directly from clinical samples.
The recent global emergence and re-emergence of arboviruses has caused significant human disease.
Common vectors, symptoms and geographical distribution make differential diagnosis both important and challenging.
We performed metagenomic sequencing using both the Illumina MiSeq and the portable Oxford Nanopore MinION to study the feasibility of whole genome sequencing from clinical samples containing chikungunya or dengue virus, two of the most important arboviruses.
Direct metagenomic sequencing of nucleic acid extracts from serum and plasma without viral enrichment allowed for virus and coinfection identification, subtype determination and in the majority of cases elucidated complete or near-complete genomes adequate for phylogenetic analysis.
This work demonstrates that metagenomic whole genome sequencing is feasible for over 90% and 80% of chikungunya and dengue virus PCR-positive patient samples respectively.
It confirms the feasibility of field metagenomic sequencing for these and likely other RNA viruses, highlighting the applicability of this approach to front-line public health.
Genetic heterogeneity in Anopheles darlingi related to biting behavior in western Amazon  In the Amazon Basin, Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) darlingi is the most aggressive and effective malaria vector.
In endemic areas, behavioral aspects of anopheline species such as host preference, biting time and resting location after a blood meal have a key impact on malaria transmission dynamics and transmission control strategies.
darlingi present a variety in behavior throughout its broad distribution including blood feeding related.
To investigate the genetic basis of its biting behaviors, host-seeking An.
darlingi were collected in two settlements (Granada and Remansinho) in Acre, Brazil.
Mosquitoes were classified by captured location (indoors or outdoors) and time (dusk or dawn).
Genome-wide SNPs were used to assess the degree of genetic diversity and structure in these groups.
darlingi blood-feeding behavior has a genetic component.
Additional ecological and genomic studies may help to understand the genetic basis of mosquito behavior and address appropriate surveillance and vector control.\n\nAuthor SummaryMalaria is a disease caused by parasite of the genus Plasmodium and is transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles.
In the Amazon Basin, the main malaria vector is Anopheles darlingi, which is present in high densities in this region.
Egg development requires that females of this mosquito seek hosts for blood meals.
Anopheles females blood feeding may occur indoor or outdoor the houses and typically from the sunset to dawn.
Anopheles darlingi in particular present great variability regarding its behaviour, presenting variety of peak biting times and patterns.
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) scattered throughout the genome of Anopheles darlingi showed genetic diversity and structure in these groups.
A comprehensive understanding of the genetic basis for mosquito behaviour may support innovative vector surveillance and control strategies.
The effect of silencing immunity related genes on longevity in the naturally occurring Anopheles arabiensis mosquito population of Southwest Ethiopia  BackgroundIn the fight against malaria, vector control remains the most important tool, butit is now severely constrained by the spread of insecticide or behavioral resistance by mosquito populations.
Such novel tools include anti-mosquito vaccines or mosquito genetic modifications targeting the mosquito midgut homeostasis and reducing the mosquito lifespan beyond a stage they can transmit malaria.\n\nMethodsWe assessed the effect of RNA interference silencing of the midgut homeostasis regulators FN3D1, FN3D2, FN3D3, GPRGR9 and PGRPLC3 in populations of Anopheles arabiensis reared at nearly natural setting.
We monitored the survival of gene-silenced mosquitoes and assessed the load of their midgut microbiota using flow cytometry.
The effect of gene silencing was modeled by the Cox proportional hazards frailty model, and bacterial counts were first log transformed and then compared by a mixed model.\n\nResultSignificantly higher mortality rates were observed for the FN3D1 (Hazard ratio =1.64, P=0.004), FN3D3 (HR=1.79, P<0.001) and GPRGr9 silenced mosquitoes (HR=2.00, P<0.001) as compared to a control group injected with dsRNA against a non-related bacterial gene LacZ.
The bacterial load ratios for all target gene silenced mosquitoes compared to control mosquitoes were above 1, with the highest value for FN3D1 equal to 2.66 (95%CI: [0.94;7.57]) but no statistically significant difference could be demonstrated.
Interestingly, there was a strong correlation (r=0.61) between the mortality hazard ratio and the bacterial count ratio of the gene-silenced mosquitoes.
Increased mortality rates were reversed when the gene-silenced mosquitoes were treated with antibiotic mixtures suggesting that gut microbiota play a key role in the observed reduction of mosquito survival.\n\nConclusionWe demonstrate that interfering with the expression of theFN3D1, FN3D3 or GPRGr9 genes can cause a significant reduction of the longevity of An.
arabiensis mosquitoes due to the disruption of the mosquito gut homeostasis.
The malaria-protective human glycophorin structural variant DUP4 shows somatic mosaicism and association with hemoglobin levels  Glycophorin A and glycophorin B are red blood cell surface proteins that are both receptors for the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, which is the principal cause of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.
DUP4 is a complex structural genomic variant that carries extra copies of a glycophorin A - glycophorin B fusion gene, and has a dramatic effect on malaria risk by reducing the risk of severe malaria by up to 40%.
Using fiber-FISH and Illumina sequencing, we validate the structural arrangement of the glycophorin locus in the DUP4 variant, and reveal somatic variation in copy number of the glycophorin A-glycophorin B fusion gene.
By developing a simple, specific, PCR-based assay for DUP4 we show the DUP4 variant reaches a frequency of 13% in a village in south-eastern Tanzania.
We genotype a substantial proportion of that village and demonstrate an association of DUP4 genotype with hemoglobin levels, a phenotype related to malaria, using a family-based association test.
Taken together, we show that DUP4 is a complex structural variant that may be susceptible to somatic variation, and show that it is associated with a malarial-related phenotype in a non-hospitalized population.\n\nSignificance statementPrevious work has identified a human complex genomic structural variant called DUP4, which includes two novel glycophorin A-glycophorin B fusion genes, is associated with a profound protection against severe malaria.
We also show evidence of somatic variation in the copy number of the fusion genes.
We develop a simple robust assay for this variant and demonstrate that DUP4 is at an appreciable population frequency in Tanzania and that it is associated with higher hemoglobin levels in a malaria-endemic village.
We suggest that DUP4 is therefore protective against malarial anemia.
Predictors of Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Tests’ Utilisation Among Healthcare Workers in Zamfara State  IntroductionEarly diagnosis and prompt and effective treatment is one of the pillars of malaria control Malaria case management guidelines recommend diagnostic testing before treatment using malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test (mRDT) or microscopy and this was adopted in Nigeria in 2010.
This study set out to assess factors influencing utilisation of mRDT among healthcare workers in Zamfara State, Nigeria.\n\nMethodsA cross-sectional study was carried out among 306 healthcare workers selected using multistage sampling from six Local Government Areas between January and February 2017.
Mixed method was used for data collection.
A pre-tested self-administered questionnaire was used to collect information on knowledge, use of mRDT and factors influencing utilization.
An observational checklist was used to assess the availability of mRDT in the six months prior to this study.
Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics such as means and proportions.
Association between mRDT use and independent variables was tested using Chi square while multiple regression was used to determine predictors of use at 5% level of significance.\n\nResultsMean age of respondents was 36.0 {+/-} 9.4years.
Overall, 198 (64.7%) of health workers had good knowledge of mRDT; malaria RDT was available in 33 (61.1%) facilities.
Routine use of mRDT was reported by 253 (82.7%) healthcare workers.
This comprised 89 (35.2%) laboratory scientists/technicians, 89 (35.2%) community health extension workers/community health officers; 59 (23.3%) nurses and 16 (6.3%) doctors.
Predictors of mRDT utilisation were good knowledge of mRDT (adjusted OR (aOR):3.3, CI: 1.6-6.7), trust in mRDT results (aOR: 4.0, CI: 1.9 - 8.2), having being trained on mRDT (aOR: 2.7, CI: 1.2 - 6.6), and provision of free mRDT (aOR: 2.3, CI: 1.0 - 5.0).\n\nConclusionThis study demonstrated that healthcare worker utilisation of mRDT was associated with health worker and health system-related factors that are potentially modifiable.
There is need to sustain training of healthcare workers on benefits of using mRDT and provision of free mRDT in health facilities.
An open-source k-mer based machine learning tool for fast and accurate subtyping of HIV-1 genomes  For many disease-causing virus species, global diversity is clustered into a taxonomy of subtypes with clinical significance.
In particular, the classification of infections among the subtypes of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a routine component of clinical management, and there are now many classification algorithms available for this purpose.
Although several of these algorithms are similar in accuracy and speed, the majority are proprietary and require laboratories to transmit HIV-1 sequence data over the network to remote servers.
We propose an open-source supervised and alignment-free subtyping method (KO_SCPCAPAMERISC_SCPCAP) that operates on k-mer frequencies in HIV-1 sequences.
Based on our testing data set of manually curated real-world HIV-1 sequences (n = 2, 784), Kameris obtained an overall accuracy of 97%, which matches or exceeds all other tested software, with a processing rate of over 1,500 sequences per second.
Furthermore, our fully standalone general-purpose software provides key advantages in terms of data security and privacy, transparency and reproducibility.
Finally, we show that our method is readily adaptable to subtype classification of other viruses including dengue, influenza A, and hepatitis B and C virus.
Extensive recoding of dengue virus type 2 specifically reduces replication in primate cells without gain-of-function in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes  Dengue virus (DENV), an arthropod-borne (\"arbovirus\") virus causing a range of human maladies ranging from self-limiting dengue fever to the life-threatening dengue shock syndrome, proliferates well in two different taxa of the Animal Kingdom, mosquitoes and primates.
Unexpectedly, mosquitoes and primates have distinct preferences when expressing their genes by translation, e.g.
members of these taxa show taxonomic group-specific intolerance to certain codon pairs.
By necessity, arboviruses evolved to delicately balance this fundamental difference in their ORFs.
Using the mosquito-borne human pathogen DENV we have undone the evolutionarily conserved genomic balance in its ORF sequence and specifically shifted the encoding preference away from primates.
Using mosquito cell cultures and two strains of Aedes aegypti we did not observe any increase in fitness in DENV2 variants codon pair deoptimized for humans.
This ability to disrupt and control an arboviruss host preference has great promise towards developing the next generation of synthetic vaccines not only for DENV but for other emerging arboviral pathogens such as chikungunya virus and Zika virus.
Model-based assessment of public health impact and cost-effectiveness of dengue vaccination following screening for prior exposure  The tetravalent dengue vaccine CYD-TDV (Dengvaxia(R)) is the first licensed vaccine against dengue, but recent findings indicate an elevated risk of severe disease among vaccinees without prior dengue virus (DENV) exposure.
The World Health Organization currently recommends CYD-TDV only for individuals with serological confirmation of past DENV exposure.
To do so, we used an agent-based model to simulate DENV transmission with and without vaccination over a 30-year timeframe.
Under a range of values for the proportion of vaccinees with prior DENV exposure, we projected the proportion of symptomatic and hospitalized cases averted as a function of the sensitivity and specificity of serological screening.
We found that public health impact depended primarily on the sensitivity of serological screening in high-transmission settings and on a combination of sensitivity and specificity in low-transmission settings.
Cost-effectiveness could be achievable from the perspective of a public payer provided that screening sensitivity for prior DENV exposure and the value of a disability-adjusted life-year were both high.
Cost-effectiveness was also achievable from an individual perspective, particularly with high screening specificity and low coverage.
In conclusion, vaccination with CYD-TDV following serological screening could have a positive impact in certain epidemiological settings, provided that screening is highly specific, at least moderately sensitive, and inexpensive.
The dengue virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is secreted from mosquito cells in association with the intracellular cholesterol transporter chaperone caveolin complex  Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne virus of the family Flaviviridae.
The RNA viral genome encodes for a polyprotein that is co-translationally processed into three structural proteins and seven non-structural proteins.
The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a multifunctional viral protein actively secreted in vertebrate and mosquito cells during DENV infection.
In mosquito cells, NS1 is secreted in a caveolin-1 (CAV-1) dependent manner by an unconventional pathway.
The caveolin chaperone complex (CCC) is a cytoplasmic complex formed by caveolin-1 and the chaperones FKBP52, Cy40 and CyA which is responsible for cholesterol traffic inside the cell.
In this work, we demonstrate that in infected mosquito cells, DENV NS1 is secreted by an early and unconventional route that bypasses the Golgi apparatus in close association with the CCC.
Treatment of mosquito cells with classic secretion inhibitors such as brefeldin A, golgicide A and Fli-06 showed no effect on NS1 secretion, but significant reductions in recombinant luciferase secretion and virion release.
Silencing the expression of CAV1, FKBP52 with siRNAs or the inhibition of CyA by cyclosporine A resulted in significant decrease in NS1 secretion without affecting virion release.
Using co-localization, co-inmunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays, NS1 was found to co-localize and interact with all the protein components of the CCC in mosquito infected cells.
In addition, CAV-1 and FKBP52 expression was found augmented in DENV infected cells.
Finally, the treatment of ZIKV infected mosquito cells with brefeldin A and golgicide A showed no effect on NS1 secretion, while affecting virion release.
ZIKV NS1 was also found to co-localize with CAV-1 in infected mosquito cells.
These results suggest that in mosquito cells, ZIKV NS1 follows the same secretory pathway observed for DENV NS1.
The association of NS1 with the cholesterol transporter CCC agrees with the lipoprotein nature of secreted hexameric NS1.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYDengue protein NS1 is secreted in infected mosquito and vertebrate cells.
In mosquito cells, NS1 follows an unconventional secretion pathway that is dependent on Caveolin-1.
This work shows that in mosquito cells, NS1 secretion is associated to the chaperone caveolin complex, a complex formed by caveolin-1 and several chaperones, in charge of cholesterol transport within the cells.
Reduction of the expression or the activity of chaperone caveolin complex in mosquito infected cells, diminished the secretion of NS1 without affecting virion release.
Direct interaction between NS1 and the chaperone caveolin complex proteins was demonstrated by several assays.
Moreover, increased expression of the caveolin-1 and co-chaperone FKBP52 during dengue infection was found, presumably in response to the higher requirements of these proteins during dengue virus infection.
Results obtained with ZIKV infected mosquito cells suggest that also ZIKV NS1 is released following an unconventional secretory route in association with the chaperone caveolin complex.
The functions of secreted NS1 within mosquito are unclear.
However, giving the importance of the soluble NS1 in the vertebrate host, manipulation of the NS1 secretory route may prove a valuable strategy for dengue mosquito control and patient treatment.
Vertical transmission of Zika virus from orally infected Aedes aegypti produces infectious adult progeny.
Vertical transmission, or pathogen transfer from mother to offspring, can facilitate persistence of emerging arboviruses, such as Zika virus (ZIKV), in mosquito populations.
Understanding vertical transmission and the different environmental and temporal conditions that affect it is important to assess whether new outbreaks could occur without reintroduction of the virus.
To determine the rate of vertical transmission for ZIKV, Aedes aegypti females were fed on ZIKV infected blood, maintained under three temperature conditions (27{degrees}C, 30{degrees}C, and 33{degrees}C), and allowed to oviposit three times.
Progeny were tested for virus presence at 3, 7, and 14 days after adult emergence.
The overall vertical transmission rate was 6.5% (3.9 - 9.9).
Vertical transmission was observed across all maternal temperature conditions and was detected in adult progeny as young as 3 days and as late as 14 days post-emergence.
In total, 3.4% (1.6 - 6.2) of adult progeny produced saliva with detectable ZIKV, indicating their capacity to transmit ZIKV to humans.
To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that vertical transmission occurs from orally-infected female Aedes aegypti to their adult progeny at a range of temperatures, and proof that Zika virus can persist in the saliva of those progeny throughout their lifetimes.
aegypti populations without a vertebrate host, allowing for human infections to occur without consistent re-introductions of ZIKV.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn 2015, Zika virus spread to over 50 countries.
However, it is not known whether the virus persisted in the outbreak areas or became locally extinct.
One way mosquito-borne viruses, like Zika, could become established is by transferring directly between mosquito generations rather than circulating between mosquitoes and humans.
As with other mosquito-borne diseases, like dengue, in order to infect humans the virus must be present in the saliva of infected mosquito progeny during blood feeding.
We found vertical transmission occurred throughout the infected mothers reproductive lifetime and across a range of temperature conditions.
Vertically infected progeny had Zika virus in their saliva as early as three days after adult emergence, implying that they could infect a person even during their first bloodmeal.
Importantly, this work indicates that Zika virus could establish itself in the mosquito population even when human to mosquito transmission is not actively occurring.
Ezetimibe inhibits Dengue virus infection in Huh 7 cells by blocking the cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 receptor  Despite the importance of Dengue virus (DENV) infection in human health, there is not a fully effective vaccine or antiviral treatment against the infection.
Since lipids such as cholesterol are required during DENV infection, its uptake and synthesis are increased in infected cells.
Ezetimibe is an FDA-approved drug that reduces cholesterol uptake in humans by inhibiting the endocytosis through Niemman-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) receptor, expressed on the membrane of enterocytes and hepatocytes.
Our results indicate that an increase in the amount of NPC1L1 occurs on the surface of Huh-7 cells during DENV infection, which correlates with an increase in cholesterol levels.
Blockage of NPC1L1 with ezetimibe in concentrations up to 50 M does not reduce cell viability but diminished total cellular cholesterol, the percentage of infected cells, viral yield, viral RNA and protein synthesis without affecting DENV binding and/or entry to Huh-7 cells.
Moreover, ezetimibe inhibited DENV replicative complex formation and lipid droplets accumulation.
All these results indicate that ezetimibe is an excellent drug to inhibit DENV infection and confirm that cholesterol is a key target to inhibit viral infection.

Functional and structural resilience of the active site loop in the evolution of Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase.
The malarial pathogen Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) is a member of the Apicomplexa, which independently evolved a highly specific lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from an ancestral malate dehydrogenase (MDH) via a five-residue insertion in a key active site loop.
PfLDH is widely considered an attractive drug target due to its unique active site.
Apicomplexan loop conservation suggests that a particular insertion sequence was required to evolve LDH specificity, and we previously showed (Boucher 2014) that a tryptophan in the insertion, W107f, is essential for activity and specificity.
Here we show that PfLDH activity is remarkably resilient to radical perturbations of both loop identity and length.
Thus, alternative insertions could have evolved LDH specificity as long as they contained a tryptophan in the proper location.
PfLDH therefore has high potential to develop resistance to drugs that target its distinctive active site.
Virus-inclusive single cell RNA sequencing reveals molecular signature predictive of progression to severe dengue infection  Dengue virus (DENV) infection can result in severe complications.
Yet, the understanding of the molecular correlates of severity is limited, partly due to difficulties in defining the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) that are associated with DENV in vivo.
Additionally, there are currently no biomarkers predictive of progression to severe dengue (SD).
Bulk transcriptomics data are difficult to interpret because blood consists of multiple cell types that may react differently to infection.
Here we applied virus-inclusive single cell RNA-seq approach (viscRNA-Seq) to profile transcriptomes of thousands of single PBMCs derived early in the course of disease from six dengue patients and four healthy controls, and to characterize distinct DENV-associated leukocytes.
Multiple genes, particularly interferon response genes, were upregulated in a cell-specific manner prior to progression to SD.
Expression of MX2 in naive B cells and CD163 in CD14+ CD16+ monocytes was predictive of SD.
The majority of DENV-associated cells in the blood of two patients who progressed to SD were naive IgM B cells expressing the CD69 and CXCR4 receptors and antiviral genes, followed by monocytes.
Bystander uninfected B cells also demonstrated immune activation, and plasmablasts from two patients exhibited antibody lineages with convergently hypermutated heavy chain sequences.
Lastly, assembly of the DENV genome revealed diversity at unexpected genomic sites.
This study presents a multi-faceted molecular elucidation of natural dengue infection in humans and proposes biomarkers for prediction of SD, with implications for profiling any tissue and viral infection, and for the development of a dengue prognostic assay.\n\nSignificanceA fraction of the 400 million people infected with dengue annually progresses to severe dengue (SD).
We profiled the landscape of host transcripts and viral RNA in thousands of single blood cells from dengue patients prior to progressing to SD.
We discovered cell-type specific immune activation and candidate predictive biomarkers.
A Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein in the Plasmodium apicoplast is essential and shows sequence-specific RNA binding  The malaria parasite Plasmodium and other apicomplexans such as Toxoplasma evolved from photosynthetic organisms and contain an essential, remnant plastid termed the apicoplast.
Transcription of the apicoplast genome is polycistronic with extensive RNA processing.
In plant chloroplasts, post-transcriptional RNA processing is controlled by multiple pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins.
Here, we present the biochemical characterisation of the single apicoplast-targeted PPR protein.
Apicoplast PPR1 is essential, and binds specific RNA sequences corresponding with previously characterized RNA processing sites.
In RNAse protection assays, PPR1 shields apicoplast transcripts from ribonuclease degradation.
Our results show that apicoplast RNA processing is under the control of a single protein, thus presenting an Achilles heel for the development of new anti-malarial drugs.
Variations in neonatal age segments mortality in Kenyas malaria epidemiological zones by community uptake of iron-supplements and anti-malaria drugs during pregnancy: Analysis based on 2014 Kenya demographic and health survey  IntroductionAlthough past studies have established that iron-supplements and anti-malaria drugs taken by mothers during pregnancy reduce the risk of neonatal deaths in high prone malaria areas, little is known about their impact on mortality risks in neonatal age segments in Kenya.
The study objective was to analyse variations in neonatal age segments mortality rates by uptake of these two antenatal care services and determine their effects on the age segments mortality in Kenyas malaria zones.\n\nData and methodsThis study used data from the 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS).
Survival status information for 20,794 children born less than 60 months prior to interview date and reported mothers uptake of iron-supplements and anti-malaria drugs during last pregnancy was analysed.
Life table method was used to estimate mortality rates and Poisson multivariate regression models were fitted to determine relative risks of death for the study variables.\n\nResultsThe results show that variations in neonatal age segments mortality in Kenyas malaria zones are statistically insignificant.
The contributions of early neonatal (0 to 7 days) to neonatal mortality rate are 80% and 100% in low and high malaria zones, respectively.
Combined high community uptake of iron-supplements and anti-malaria drugs during pregnancy reduce significantly mortality risk in late neonatal (8 days to less than one month) in all malaria zones when effects of other risk factors are controlled for.\n\nConclusionsThe findings suggest that future decline in neonatal mortality in all Kenyas malaria zones depend mainly on reduction of early neonatal mortality.
High community uptake of iron-supplements and anti-malaria drugs during pregnancy has significant reduction effect on late neonatal mortality in all malaria zones.
This study recommends improvement of future KDHS data quality, especially on care for small and sick neonates.
Genomic from Plasmodium falciparum field isolates from Benin allows the identification of PfEMP1 variants by LC-MS/MS at the patient’s level  PfEMP1 are the major protein family from parasitic origin involves in the pathophysiology of severe malaria, and PfEMP1 domain subtypes are associated with the infection outcome.
In addition, PfEMP1 variability in endless and current protein repository do not reflect the immense diversity of the sequences of PfEMP1 proteins.
The aim of our study was to identify the different PfEMP1 variants expressed within a patient sample by mass spectrometry.
We performed a proteogenomic approach to decipher at the patients level PfEMP1 expression in different clinical settings: cerebral malaria, severe anemia and uncomplicated malaria.
The combination of whole genome sequencing approach, RNAsequencing, and mass spectrometry proteomic analysis allowed to attribute PfEMP1 sequences to each sample and classify the relative expression level of PfEMP1 proteins within each sample.
We predicted PfEMP1 structures using the newly identified protein sequences.
We confirmed the involvement of DBL{beta} in malaria pathogenesis and observed that CIDR domains linked to ICAM-1 binding DBL{beta} domains displayed EPCR binding structure.
Whole genome sequencing reveals high complexity of copy number variation at insecticide resistance loci in malaria mosquitoes  BackgroundPolymorphisms in the copy number of a genetic region can influence gene expression, coding sequence and zygosity, making them powerful actors in the evolutionary process.
Copy number variants (CNVs) are however understudied, being more difficult to detect than single nucleotide polymorphisms.
We take advantage of the intense selective pressures on the major malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, caused by the widespread use of insecticides for malaria control, to investigate the role of CNVs in the evolution of insecticide resistance.\n\nResultsUsing the whole-genome sequencing data from 1142 samples in the An.
gambiae 1000 genomes project, we identified 1557 independent increases in copy number, encompassing a total of 267 genes, which were enriched for gene families linked to metabolic insecticide resistance.
The five major candidate genes for metabolic resistance were all found in at least one CNV, and were often the target of multiple independent CNVs, reaching as many as 16 CNVs in Cyp9k1.
These CNVs have furthermore been spreading due to positive selection, indicated by high local CNV frequencies and extended haplotype homozygosity.\n\nConclusionsOur results demonstrate the importance of CNVs in the response to selection, with CNVs being closely associated with genes involved in the evolution of resistance to insecticides, highlighting the urgent need to identify their relative contributions to resistance and to track their spread as the application of insecticide in malaria endemic countries intensifies.
Our detailed descriptions of CNVs found across the species range provides the tools to do so.
Access to and use of preventive intermittent treatment for Malaria during pregnancy: a qualitative study in Chokwe district, Southern Mozambique  BackgroundMalaria remains a significant health problem in Mozambique, particularly to pregnant women and children less than five years old.
Intermittent preventive treatment is recommended for malaria prevention in pregnancy (IPTp).
In this study, we aimed to explore the factors limiting the access and use of IPTp-SP in Chokwe district.\n\nMethods and findingsWe used qualitative research methods through semi-structured interviews to collect data from 46 pregnant women and four health care staff from Chokwe, a rural area of southern Mozambique.
Data were transcribed, manually coded and analysed using content and thematic method.
Participants were not aware of pregnancy-related risks of malaria infection or the benefit of malaria prevention in pregnancy.
Late and infrequently antenatal care (ANC) attendance, concerns about the long waiting time at ANC consultations,plus reluctance to disclose the pregnancy early, emerged as driving factors for inadequate IPTp delivery.\n\nConclusionsPregnant women experience substantial barriers to receive adequate IPTp-SP dosing for malaria prevention.
Poor awareness, non-compliance with ANC attendance and poor attitude of health care staff were main barriers to IPTp-SP delivery.
There is a need to strengthen actions that improve awareness about malaria and prevention among pregnant women, as well as quality services across the ANC services in order to increase IPTp-SP uptake.
Reproductive functions and genetic architecture of the seminal fluid and sperm proteomes of the mosquito Aedes aegypti  The yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, transmits several viruses, including dengue, Zika, and chikungunya.
Some proposed efforts to control this vector involve manipulating reproduction to suppress wild populations or replacing them with disease-resistant mosquitoes.
The design of such strategies requires an intimate knowledge of reproductive processes, yet our basic understanding of reproductive genetics in this vector remains largely incomplete.
To accelerate future investigations, we have comprehensively catalogued sperm and seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) transferred to females in the ejaculate using tandem mass spectrometry.
By excluding female-derived proteins using an isotopic labelling approach, we identified 870 sperm proteins and 280 seminal fluid proteins.
Functional composition analysis revealed parallels with known aspects of sperm biology and SFP function in other insects.
To corroborate our proteome characterization, we also generated transcriptomes for testes and the male accessory glands--the primary contributors to Ae.
aegypti sperm and seminal fluid, respectively.
Differential gene expression of accessory glands from virgin and mated males suggests that protein translation is upregulated post-mating.
Several SFP transcripts were also modulated after mating, but >90% remained unchanged.
Finally, a significant enrichment of SFPs was observed on chromosome 1, which harbors the male sex determining locus in this species.
Our study provides a comprehensive proteomic and transcriptomic characterization of ejaculate production and composition and thus provides a foundation for future investigations of Ae.
aegypti reproductive biology, from functional analysis of individual proteins to broader examination of reproductive processes.
Predicting Aquatic Development and Mortality Rates of Aedes Aegypti  Mosquito-borne pathogens continue to be a significant burden within human populations, with Aedes aegypti continuing to spread dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus throughout the world.
Using data from a previously conducted study, a linear regression model was constructed to predict the aquatic development rates based on the average temperature, temperature fluctuation range, and larval density.
Additional experiments were conducted with different parameters of average temperature and larval density to validate the model.
Using a paired t-test, the model predictions were compared to experimental data and showed that the prediction models were not significantly different for average pupation rate, adult emergence rate, and juvenile mortality rate.
The models developed will be useful for modeling and estimating the number of Aedes aegypti in the environment under different temperature, diurnal temperature variations, and larval densities.\n\nAuthor SummaryUsing experimental data from experiments conducted on Aedes aegypti, we formulated regression models to predict pupation, adult emergence, and juvenile mortality rates based on average temperature, temperature fluctuation range, and larval density.
The prediction models produced were shown to account for high levels of variation within the data.
Our results show that the models produce results that are not significantly different from the experimental results and are capable of predicting aquatic development rates of Ae.
The ER chaperone PfGRP170 is essential for asexual development and is linked to stress response in malaria parasites.
The vast majority of malaria mortality is attributed to one parasite species: Plasmodium falciparum.
Asexual replication of the parasite within the red blood cell is responsible for the pathology of the disease.
In this study, we tested the role of an uncharacterized ER protein, PfGRP170, in regulating these key functions by generating conditional mutants.
Our data show that PfGRP170 localizes to the ER and is essential for asexual growth, specifically required for proper development of schizonts.
PfGRP170 is essential for surviving heat shock, suggesting a critical role in cellular stress response.
The data demonstrate that PfGRP170 interacts with the Plasmodium orthologue of the ER chaperone, BiP.
Finally, we found that loss of PfGRP170 function leads to the activation of the Plasmodium eIF2 kinase, PK4, suggesting a specific role for this protein in this parasite stress response pathway.
Field evaluation of malachite green loop-mediated isothermal amplification as a malaria parasite detection tool in a health post in Roraima state, Brazil  Malaria is a debilitating parasitic disease that causes significant morbidity and mortality.
Microscopic detection of parasites is currently the \"gold standard\" diagnostic.
Malaria epidemiological surveillance studies especially aimed at the detection of low-density infection and asymptomatic cases will require more sensitive and user-friendly tools.
We have shown previously that the molecular-based, colorimetric malachite green loop-mediated isothermal amplification (MG-LAMP) assay is a valuable tool for diagnosing malaria infection in a laboratory setting.
In this study, we field evaluated this assay in a malaria diagnostic post in Roraima, Brazil.
We prospectively collected 91 patient samples and performed microscopy, MG-LAMP, and real-time PCR (PET-PCR) to detect Plasmodium infection.
Two independent readers were used to score the MG-LAMP tests to assess whether the sample was positive (blue/green) or negative (clear).
There was 100% agreement between the two readers (Kappa=1).
All tests detected 33 positive samples, but both the MG-LAMP and PET-PCR detected 6 and 7 more positive samples, respectively.
The PET-PCR assay detected 6 mixed infections (defined as infection with both P. falciparum and P. vivax) while microscopy detected one and MG-LAMP detected two of these mixed infections.
The PET-PCR assay detected 6 mixed infections (defined as infection with both P. falciparum and P. vivax) while microscopy detected one and MG-LAMP detected two of these mixed infections.
The PET-PCR assay detected 6 mixed infections (defined as infection with both P. falciparum and P. vivax) while microscopy detected one and MG-LAMP detected two of these mixed infections.
Microscopy did not detect any Plasmodium infection in 26 of the enrolled asymptomatic cases while MG-LAMP detected five and PET-PCR assay three positive cases.
Overall, MG-LAMP provided a simpler and user-friendly molecular method for malaria diagnosis that is more sensitive than microscopy.
Additionally, MG- LAMP has the capacity to test 38 samples per run (one hour), allowing for the screening of large number of samples which is appealing when large-scale studies are necessary e.g.
in community surveillance studies.
The current MG-LAMP assay was limited in its ability to detect mixed infection when compared to the PET-PCR, but otherwise proved to be a powerful tool for malaria parasite detection in the field and opens new perspectives in the implementation of surveillance studies in malaria elimination campaigns.
The metabolic repair enzyme phospho-glycolate phosphatase regulates central carbon metabolism and fosmidomycin sensitivity in Plasmodium falciparum  The asexual blood stages of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum are highly dependent on glycolysis for ATP synthesis, redox balance and provision of essential anabolic precursors.
Recent studies have suggested that members of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) family of metabolite phosphatases may play an important role in regulating multiple pathways in P. falciparum central carbon metabolism.
Here, we show that the P. falciparum HAD protein, phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PfPGP), which is homologous to yeast Pho13 and mammalian PGP, regulates glycolysis in asexual blood stages by controlling intracellular levels of several intermediates and novel end-products of this pathway.
Deletion of the P. falciparum pgp gene significantly attenuated asexual parasite growth in red blood cells, while comprehensive metabolomic analysis revealed the accumulation of two previously uncharacterized metabolites, as well as changes in a number of intermediates in glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway.
The two unknown metabolites were assigned as 2-phospho-lactate and 4-phosphoerythronate by comparison of their mass spectra with synthetic standards.
2-Phospho-lactate was significantly elevated in wildtype and {Delta}PfPGP parasites cultivated in the presence of methylglyoxal and D-lactate, but not L-lactate, indicating that it is a novel end-product of the methylglyoxal pathway.
4-Phosphoerythronate is a putative side product of the glycolytic enzyme, glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase and the accumulation of both 4-phosphoerythronate and 2-phospho-D-lactate were associated with changes in glycolytic and the pentose phosphate pathway fluxes as shown by 13C-glucose labelling studies and increased sensitivity of the {Delta}PfPGP parasites to the drug fosmidomycin.
Our results suggest that PfPGP contributes to a novel futile metabolic cycle involving the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of D-lactate as well as detoxification of metabolites, such as 4-phosphoerythronate, and both may have important roles in regulating P. falciparum central carbon metabolism.\n\nAuthor summaryThe major pathogenic stages of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, develop in red blood cells where they have access to an abundant supply of glucose.
While these pathways also exist in host cells, there is increasing evidence that P. falciparum has evolved novel ways for regulating glucose metabolism that could be targeted by next-generation of anti-malarial drugs.
In this study, we show the red blood cell stages of P. falciparum express an enzyme that is specifically involved in regulating the intracellular levels of two metabolites that are novel end-products or side products of glycolysis.
Parasite mutants lacking this enzyme are viable but exhibit diminished growth rates in red blood cells.
Our findings suggest that metabolic end/side products of glycolysis directly regulate the metabolism of these parasites, and that the intracellular levels of these are tightly controlled by previously uncharacterized metabolite phosphatases.
The Plasmodium falciparum cytoplasmic translation apparatus: a promising therapeutic target not yet exploited by clinically approved antimalarials.
The continued specter of resistance to existing antimalarials necessitates the pursuit of novel targets and mechanisms of action for drug development.
One class of promising targets consists of the 80S ribosome and its associated components comprising the parasite translational apparatus.
Development of translation-targeting therapeutics requires a greater understanding of protein synthesis and its regulation in the malaria parasite.
We have recently developed and optimized the PfIVT assay, an in vitro method directly measuring translation in whole-cell extracts from the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.Here, we present an extensive pharmacologic assessment of the PfIVT assay using a wide range of known inhibitors, demonstrating its utility for studying activity of both ribosomal and non-ribosomal elements directly involved in translation.
We further demonstrate the superiority of this assay over a historically utilized indirect measure of translation, S35-radiolabel incorporation.
Additionally, we utilize the PfIVT assay to investigate a panel of clinically approved antimalarial drugs, many with unknown or unclear mechanisms of action, and show that none inhibit translation, reaffirming Plasmodium translation to be a viable alternative drug target.
Within this set, we unambiguously find that mefloquine lacks translation inhibition activity, despite having been recently mischaracterized as a ribosomal inhibitor.
This work exploits a direct and reproducible assay for measuring P. falciparum translation, demonstrating its value in the continued study of protein synthesis in malaria and its inhibition as a drug target.\n\nAuthor summaryNovel antimalarial drugs are required to combat rising resistance to current therapies.
The protein synthesis machinery of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is a promising unexploited target for antimalarial development, but its study has been hindered by use of indirect experimental methods which often produce misleading and inaccurate results.
We have recently developed a direct method to investigate malaria protein synthesis utilizing whole-parasite extracts.
In this work, we present an extensive characterization of the assay, using a panel of pharmacologic inhibitors with known mechanisms of action.
We demonstrate the specificity of the assay in various stages of protein synthesis, as well as its improved accuracy and sensitivity in comparison to an indirect measure that has been the previous standard for the field.
We further demonstrate that no current clinically available antimalarial drugs inhibit protein synthesis, emphasizing its potential as a target for drugs that will overcome existing resistance.
Importantly, among the antimalarials tested was mefloquine, a widely used antimalarial that has recently been mischaracterized as an inhibitor protein synthesis.
Our finding that mefloquine does not inhibit protein synthesis emphasizes the importance of using direct functional measurements when determining drug targets.
Knockdown of the translocon protein EXP2, reduces growth and protein export in malaria parasites.
Malaria parasites remodel their host erythrocytes to gain nutrients and avoid the immune system.
Host erythrocytes are modified by hundreds of effectors proteins exported from the parasites into the host cell.
Protein export is mediated by the PTEX translocon comprising five core components of which EXP2 is considered to form the putative pore that spans the vacuole membrane enveloping the parasite within its erythrocyte.
To explore the function and importance of EXP2 for parasite survival in the asexual blood stage of Plasmodium falciparum we inducibly knocked down the expression of EXP2.
Reduction in EXP2 expression strongly reduced parasite growth proportional to the degree of protein knockdown and tended to stall development about half way through the asexual cell cycle.
Once the knockdown inducer was removed and EXP2 expression restored, parasite growth recovered dependent upon the length and degree of knockdown.
To establish EXP2 function and hence the basis for growth reduction, the trafficking of an exported protein was monitored following EXP2 knockdown.
This resulted in severe attenuation of protein export and is consistent with EXP2, and PTEX in general, being the conduit for export of proteins into the host compartment.
Transcriptome profiles and novel lncRNA identification of Aedes aegypti cells in response to dengue virus serotype 1  Dengue virus (DENV) is a single-stranded, positive-strand RNA virus that belongs to the family of Flaviviridae, and it is mainly transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti (Ae.
Understanding the interaction of the virus with mosquito vector is vital for devising new strategies for preventing virus transmission.
Although protein-coding genes have been the central focus, many reports indicated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were also involved in virus-host interaction.
Recently, the latest version of Ae.
aegypti genome (AaegL5) was released, and the assembly was up to chromosome level.
This prompted us to perform lncRNA identification and characterization using the latest genome release as reference.
In this study, we investigated the transcriptome profiles of both protein-coding and lncRNA genes in Aedes aegypti cells upon DENV infection.
By combining RNA-seq libraries generated in this study with publicly available datasets, we identified a total of 7,221 novel lncRNA transcripts, of which 3,052 and 3,620 were intronic and intergenic respectively, while 549 were antisense to the reference genes.
A total of 2,435 differentially expressed transcripts, of which 956 of them were lncRNAs.
Overall, the distribution of lncRNA expression and fold change upon virus infection were lower than that of protein-coding genes.
We found that the expression of immune-related genes involved in IMD and MAPK signaling pathways were altered.
In addition, the expression of major genes involved in RNA-interference (RNAi) pathway that confers antiviral resistance in mosquitoes were found to be unchanged upon DENV infection.
Gene ontology analysis suggests that differentially expressed transcripts, either upregulated or downregulated, generally belong to the same functional categories or working in similar signaling pathways.
aegypti responses to DENV infection at gene level.\n\nAuthor SummaryDengue virus (DENV), a single-stranded and positive-strand RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae, is primarily transmitted by Aedes aegypti (Ae.
There are four closely related but antigenically different serotypes of dengue virus namely DENV1-4.
Our understanding on the interaction of each serotype of DENV with its mosquito vector is still very limited.
Since vector-borne viruses pose significant burden to public health, knowledge on the virus-host interaction at the molecular level is essential, especially in developing effective strategies to control virus transmission.
In this study, we embarked on investigating the transcriptional response of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and protein-coding genes upon dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV1) infection.
Besides, we also generate a comprehensive list of novel lncRNAs identified from the latest and improved genome version of Ae.
Similar to protein-coding genes, we discovered that the overall expression of lncRNA was significantly altered, suggesting that lncRNAs were involved in virus-host interaction.

Cationic charge and polyspecificity of an integrin domain regulates infectivity of malaria parasites  Cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion is critical for many functions in life.
In eukaryotes, I-domains mediate functions as divergent as tissue traversal by malaria-causing Plasmodium parasites as well as cell adhesion and migration by human leucocytes.
The I-domain containing protein TRAP is important for Plasmodium sporozoite motility and invasion.
Here we show that the I-domain of TRAP is required to mediate adhesional properties which can be partially preserved when the native I-domain is replaced by I-domains from human integrins or from an apicomplexan parasite that does not infect insects.
By putting in vivo data and structural features in perspective we conclude that polyspecificity and positive charge around the ligand binding site of the I-domain are important for TRAP function.
Our data suggest a highly preserved functionality of I-domains across eukaryotic evolution that is used by apicomplexan parasites to invade a broad range of tissues in a variety of hosts.
Molecular characterization of the viral structural gene of the first dengue virus type 1 outbreak in Xishuangbanna, a border area of China, Burma and Laos  In the context of recent arbovirus epidemics, dengue fever is becoming a greater concern around the world.
In August 2017, Xishuangbanna, which is a border city of China, Burma and Laos, had its first major dengue outbreak.
A total of 156 serum samples from febrile patients were collected; 97 DENV positive serum samples were screened out, and viral RNAs were successfully and directly extracted, including 77 cases from China and 20 cases from Myanmar.
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all of the strains were classified as DENV-1.
There are eight epidemic dengue strains from Myanmar and 74 from Jinghong, Xishuangbanna, that were classified as cluster 1, which are the most similar to the strain of China Guangzhou 2011.
There are three epidemic strains from Xishuangbanna Mengla that were classified as cluster 2, which have the closest relationship to the strain of China Hubei 2014.
However, there are 12 epidemic strains from Myanmar that were classified as cluster 3, which have the closest relationship to the strain of Laos from 2008, which shows that there is a recycling epidemic trend of DENV in China.
There were 236 mutations in the base, which caused 31 nonsynonymous mutations in the DENV structural protein C/prM/E genes when the strain of Xishuangbanna and Myanmar were compared with the DENV-1SS.
There is no clear homologous recombination signal among these stains.
Homology modeling possibly predicted a three-dimensional structure of the structural protein of these strains and revealed that they had the same three-dimensional structure and all had five predicted protein binding sites, but there are differences in binding site 434 (DENV-1SS: Thr434, DV-Jinghong: Ser434, DV-Myanmar: Ser434, DV-Mengla: Ser434).
The results of the molecular clock phylogenetic and demographic reconstruction analysis show that DENV-1 became highly diversified in 1972 followed by a slightly decreased period until 2017.
In conclusion, our study lays the foundation for studying the global evolution and prevalence of DENV.\n\nAuthor SummaryDengue fever (DF) is a mosquito-borne illness caused by a flavivirus.
Human infections with Dengue virus (DENV) could cause fever, cutaneous rash and malaise.
Xishuangbanna, which is located in the southwestern Yunnan Province and is a border city with China, Burma and Laos, was reported to have outbreak of DENV in 2013 and 2015 with different types.
However, there was a large outburst of dengue in May 2017.
To understand the genetic characterization, potential source and evolution of the virus, 156 serum samples were analyzed.
We focused on: (i) Phylogenetic analysis of the structural protein genes sequences; (ii) Mutation, recombination analysis and predicted protein binding sites of the structural protein genes; (iii) Molecular clock and demographic reconstruction of global dengue virus serotype 1(DENV-1).
Our results indicated that this is the first outbreak of DENV-1 in Xishuangbanna, dengue epidemic strains on the Burma border of China show diversification, we found a virulence site changed from I to T(amino acid position: 440), which may lead to weakened virulence of the epidemic strains.
We found that the evolution of DENV-1 is dominated by regional evolution.
Whats more, DENV-1 became highly diversified in 1972 followed by a slightly decreased period until 2017.
The geography of malaria elimination in Bangladesh: combining data layers to estimate the spatial spread of parasites  Malaria control programs face difficult resource allocation decisions.
Of particular concern for countries aiming for malaria elimination, the regular movement of individuals to and from endemic areas undermines local interventions by reintroducing infections and sustaining local transmission.
Quantifying this movement of malaria parasites around a country has become a priority for national control programs, but remains methodologically challenging, particularly in areas with highly mobile populations.
Here, we combined multiple data sources to measure the geographical spread of malaria parasites, including epidemiological surveillance data, travel surveys, parasite genetic data, and anonymized mobile phone data.
We collected parasite genetic barcodes and travel surveys from 2,090 patients residing in 176 unions in southeast Bangladesh.
We developed a genetic mixing index to quantify the likelihood of samples being local or imported.
We then inferred the direction and intensity of parasite flow between locations using an epidemiological model, and estimated the proportion of imported cases assuming mobility patterns parameterized using the travel survey and mobile phone calling data.
We identify a consistent north/south separation of the Chittagong Hill Tracts region in Bangladesh, and found that in addition to imported infections from forested regions, frequent mixing also occurs in low transmission but highly populated areas in the southwest.
Thus, unlike risk maps generated from incidence alone, our maps provide evidence that elimination programs must address ongoing movement of parasites around the lower transmission areas in the southwest.
Assessment of biological role and insight into druggability of the Plasmodium falciparum protease plasmepsin V  Upon infection of a red blood cell (RBC), the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum drastically remodels its host by exporting hundreds of proteins into the RBC cytosol.
This program of protein export is essential for parasite survival, hence there is interest in export-related proteins as potential drug targets.
One proposed target is plasmepsin V (PMV), an aspartic protease that cleaves export-destined proteins in the parasite ER at a motif called the Plasmodium export element (PEXEL).
Despite long-standing interest in PMV, functional studies have been hindered by the failure of current technologies to produce a regulatable lethal depletion of PMV.
Under maximal knockdown conditions, parasite growth was arrested, validating PMV as essential for parasite survival in RBCs.
We found that PMV levels had to be dramatically depleted to affect parasite growth, suggesting that the parasite maintains this enzyme in substantial excess.
Additionally, we found that PMV-depleted parasites arrest immediately after invasion of the host cell, suggesting that PMV has an unappreciated role in early development that is distinct from its previously reported role in protein export in later-stage parasites.\n\nImportanceMalaria is endemic to large swaths of the developing world, causing nearly 500,000 deaths each year.
While infection can be treated with antimalarial drugs, resistance continues to emerge to frontline antimalarials, spurring calls for new drugs and targets to feed the drug development pipeline.
One proposed target is the aspartic protease plasmepsin V (PMV) that processes exported proteins, enabling the export program that remodels the host cell.
This work uses facile genetic tools to produce lethal depletion of PMV, validating it as a drug target and showing that PMV is made in substantial excess in blood-stage parasites.
Unexpectedly, PMV depletion leads to parasite death immediately after invasion of RBCs, distinct from other disruptions of the export pathway.
This suggests that PMV inhibitors could lead to relatively rapid parasite death, and that PMV has additional unexplored role(s) during RBC infection.
Leveraging the effects of chloroquine on resistant malaria parasites for combination therapies  Malaria is a major global health problem, with the Plasmodium falciparum protozoan parasite causing the most severe form of the disease.
Prevalence of drug-resistant P. falciparum highlights the need to understand the biology of resistance and to identify novel combination therapies that are effective against resistant parasites.
Resistance has compromised the therapeutic use of many antimalarial drugs, including chloroquine, and limited our ability to treat malaria across the world.
Fortunately, chloroquine resistance comes at a fitness cost to the parasite; this can be leveraged in developing combination therapies or to reinstate use of chloroquine.
To understand biological changes induced by chloroquine treatment, we compared transcriptomics data from chloroquine-resistant parasites in the presence or absence of the drug.
Using both linear models and a genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction of the parasite to interpret the expression data, we identified targetable pathways in resistant parasites.
This study identified an increased importance of lipid synthesis, glutathione production/cycling, isoprenoids biosynthesis, and folate metabolism in response to chloroquine.
We identified potential drug targets for chloroquine combination therapies.
Significantly, our analysis suggests that the combination of chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine or fosmidomycin may be more effective against chloroquine-resistant parasites than either drug alone; further studies will explore the use of these drugs as chloroquine resistance blockers.
Additional metabolic weaknesses were found in glutathione generation and lipid synthesis during chloroquine treatment.
These processes could be targeted with novel inhibitors to reduce parasite growth and reduce the burden of malaria infections.
Thus, we identified metabolic weaknesses of chloroquine-resistant parasites and propose targeted chloroquine combination therapies.
Risk Factors Associated with Dengue Virus Infection in Guangdong Province: a Community-based Case-control Study  BackgroundDengue fever is a mosquito-borne infectious disease, and it is now still epidemic in China, especially in Guangdong Province.
Owing to the absence of dengue vaccination, effective preventive measure is critical for controlling of dengue fever.
This study aimed to explore the individual risk factors of dengue virus infection in Guangdong Province, as well as to provide a scientific basis for prevention and supervision of dengue fever in future.\n\nMethodsA case-control study including 237 cases and 237 controls was performed.
Univariate analysis was used for preliminary screening of 28 variables potentially related to dengue virus infection, and an unconditioned logistic regression analysis was used for multivariate analysis to analysis those statistically significant variables.\n\nResultsMultivariate analysis of the result showed three independent risk factors: activities in the park (odd ratio [OR]= 1.70, 95%CI 1.03 to 2.83), outdoor sports (OR= 1.67, 95%CI 1.07 to 2.62), and poor indoor daylight quality (OR= 2.27, 95%CI 1.00 to 5.15); and two protective factors: two persons per room (OR=0.43, 95%CI 0.28 to 0.67), three persons and above per room (OR=0.43, 95%CI 0.22 to 0.86), using air-condition (OR=0.43, 95%CI 0.20 to 0.93).\n\nConclusionThese results are conducive to learn the risk factors for dengue virus infection in Guangdong Province.
In addition, more systematic studies are needed to explore the other potential risk factors for dengue fever infection.\n\nAuthor summaryDengue fever, one of the mosquito-borne infectious diseases, is mainly transmitted by Aedes aegypti in Asia and Southeast Asia countries.
Since 1978, the incidence of dengue fever has markedly increased in China especially in Guangdong province.
In order to formulate the effective prevention and control measures, we explored the risk factors of dengue virus infection in Guangdong Province by conducting a case-control study.
In this study, 237 patients with dengue virus infection and 237 participants without dengue virus infection were included.
Then through these questionnaires and data analysis, we found that activities in the park, outdoor sports, and poor indoor daylight quality significantly contributed to the residents risk of dengue virus infection.
On the other hand, we observed that using air-condition and using anti-mosquito measures were effective personal prevention interventions.
Schlafen 11 Restricts Flavivirus Replication  Schlafen 11 (Slfn11) is a ubiquitously expressed interferon stimulating gene (ISG) that controls synthesis of proteins by regulating tRNA abundance.
Likely through this mechanism, Slfn11 has previously been shown to impair human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection and the expression of codon-biased open reading frames.
Because replication of positive-sense single-stranded RNA [(+)ssRNA viruses] requires the immediate translation of the incoming viral genome whereas negative sense, single stranded [(-)ssRNA] viruses carry at infection an RNA replicase that makes multiple translation competent copies of the incoming viral genome, we reasoned that (+)ssRNA viruses will be more sensitive to the effect of Slfn11 on protein synthesis than (-)ssRNA viruses.
To evaluate this hypothesis, we tested the effects of Slfn11 on the replication of a panel of ssRNA viruses in the human glioblastoma cell line A172, which naturally expresses Slfn11.
Depletion of Slfn11 in this cell line significantly increased the replication of (+)ssRNA viruses from the Flavivirus family, including West Nile (WNV), dengue (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) but had no significant effect on the replication of the (-)ssRNA viruses vesicular stomatitis (VSV, Rhabdoviridae family) and Rift Valley fever (RVFV, Phenuiviridae family).
Despite that WNV titers in Slfn11-deficient cells were almost 100-fold higher than in cells expressing this protein; they produced approximately two-fold less viral particles, as determined by PCR-based quantification of virion-associated WNV RNA in the cell culture supernatant.
These data indicated that Slfn11 impairs WNV fitness but does not affect other steps of the viral life cycle including entry, viral RNA replication and translation, and budding.
Similarly to the proposed anti-HIV-1 mechanism of Slfn11, this protein prevented WNV-induced down-regulation of a subset of tRNAs implicated in the translation of 19% of the viral polyprotein.
Importantly, we provided evidence suggesting that the broad anti-viral activity of Slfn11 requires other cellular proteins, since overexpression of Slfn11 in cells that naturally lack the expression of this protein, did not impair WNV or HIV-1 infection.
In summary, this study demonstrates that Slfn11 restricts flaviviruses replication by impairing viral fitness.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe host targets mechanisms that viruses have evolved to optimize replication.
We provide evidence that the cellular protein Schlafen 11 (Slf11) impairs replication of flaviviruses, including West Nile (WNV), dengue (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV).
However, replication of single-stranded, negative RNA viruses was not affected.
Specifically, Slf11 decreases the fitness of WNV potentially by preventing virus-induced modifications of the host tRNA repertoire that could lead to enhanced viral protein folding.
Furthermore, we demonstrated that Slf11 is not the limiting factor of this novel broad anti-viral pathway.
Haematological parameters and plasma levels of 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α in malaria-sickle cell co-morbidity: A cross sectional study  IntroductionMalaria and sickle cell disease (SCD) co-morbidity have previously been reported in Ghana.
However, there is paucity of data on haematological profiles and oxidative stress in comorbidity states.
This study identified novel inflammatory biomarkers associated with malaria in SCD and analyzed the levels of 8-iso-prostaglandin F2 oxidative stress biomarker in malaria-SCD co-morbidity in Ghanaian patients.\n\nMethodsBlood (5ml) was collected from malaria patients into K3-EDTA tube.
Malaria parasites speciation and quantification were then done according WHO guidelines.
All eligible samples were assayed for haematological profile, sickle cell phenotyping, infectious markers (hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis and HIV 1&2) and plasma levels of 8-epi-prostaglandin F2..\n\nResultsPrevalence of malaria in SCD (malaria-SCD) was 13.4% (45/335).
Male: female ratio was 0.8:1 (X2=1.43, p=0.231).
Mean ages for malaria in normal haemoglobin type (malaria-HbAA) and malaria-SCD were 12.79{+/-}4.91 and 11.56{+/-}3.65 years respectively (p=0.048).
Geometric mean of parasite density was higher in malaria-HbAA (20394 parasites/l vs. 9990 parasites/l, p=0.001) whilst mean body temperature was higher in malaria-SCD (39.0{+/-}0.87{degrees}C vs. 37.9{+/-}1.15{degrees}C, p=0.001).
Geometric mean of parasite density was higher in malaria-HbAA (20394 parasites/l vs. 9990 parasites/l, p=0.001) whilst mean body temperature was higher in malaria-SCD (39.0{+/-}0.87{degrees}C vs. 37.9{+/-}1.15{degrees}C, p=0.001).
Geometric mean of parasite density was higher in malaria-HbAA (20394 parasites/l vs. 9990 parasites/l, p=0.001) whilst mean body temperature was higher in malaria-SCD (39.0{+/-}0.87{degrees}C vs. 37.9{+/-}1.15{degrees}C, p=0.001).
Mean leukocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, monocytes, platelets and platelet indices values were significantly elevated in malaria-SCD.
Significant reduction in RBC and RBC indices in malaria-SCD were also observed.
Eosinophils-to-basophils ratio (EBR) and monocytes-to-basophils ratio (MBR) were novel cellular inflammatory biomarkers which could predict malaria in SCD.
The sensitivities of cut-off values of EBR>14, MBR>22 and combined use of EBR>14 and MBR>22 were 79.55%, 84.09% and 91.11% respectively.
Mean 8-iso-prostaglandin F2 was 338.1pg/ml in malaria-HbAA and 643.8pg/ml in malaria-SCD (p=0.001).
8-iso-prostaglandin F2 correlated with parasite density (r=0.787, p=0.001), temperature (r=0.566, p=0.001) and leucocytes (r=0.573, p=0.001) and negatively correlated with RBC (r=-0.476, p=0.003), haemoglobin (r=-0.851, p=0.001) and haematocrit (r=-0.735, p=0.001).\n\nConclusionPlasmodium falciparum parasitaemia increases oxidative damage and causes derangement haematological parameters.
Cut of values of EBR>14 and MBR>22 could predict malaria in SCD.
XTalkiiS: a tool for finding data-driven cross-talks between intra-/inter-species pathways  Cell-cell communication via pathway cross-talks within a single species have been studied in silico recently to decipher various disease phenotype.
However, computational prediction of pathway cross-talks among multiple species in a data-driven manner is yet to be explored.
In this article, I present XTalkiiS (Cross-talks between inter-/intra species pathways), a tool to automatically predict pathway cross-talks from data-driven models of pathway network, both within the same organism (intra-species) and between two organisms (inter-species).
XTalkiiS starts with retrieving and listing up-to-date pathway information in all the species available in KEGG database using RESTful APIs (exploiting KEGG web services) and an in-house built web crawler.
I hypothesize that data-driven network models can be built by simultaneously quantifying co-expression of pathway components (i.e.
genes/proteins) in matched samples in multiple organisms.
Next, XTalkiiS loads a data-driven pathway network and applies a novel cross-talk modelling approach to determine interactions among known KEGG pathways in selected organisms.
The potentials of XTalkiiS are huge as it paves the way of finding novel insights into mechanisms how pathways from two species (ideally host-parasite) may interact that may contribute to the various phenotype of interests such as malaria disease.
XTalkiiS is made open sourced at https://github.com/Akmazad/XTalkiiS and its binary files are freely available for downloading from https://sourceforge.net/projects/xtalkiis/.
Adding function to the genome of African Salmonella ST313  Salmonella Typhimurium ST313 causes invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella (iNTS) disease in sub-Saharan Africa, targeting susceptible HIV+, malarial or malnourished individuals.
An in-depth genomic comparison between the ST313 isolate D23580, and the well-characterized ST19 isolate 4/74 that causes gastroenteritis across the globe, revealed extensive synteny.
To understand how the 856 nucleotide variations generated phenotypic differences, we devised a large-scale experimental approach that involved the global gene expression analysis of strains D23580 and 4/74 grown in sixteen infection-relevant growth conditions.
Comparison of transcriptional patterns identified virulence and metabolic genes that were differentially expressed between D23580 versus 4/74, many of which were validated by proteomics.
We also uncovered the S. Typhimurium D23580 and 4/74 genes that showed expression differences during infection of murine macrophages.
Our comparative transcriptomic data are presented in a new enhanced version of the Salmonella expression compendium SalComD23580: bioinf.gen.tcd.ie/cgi-bin/salcom_v2.pl.
We discovered that the ablation of melibiose utilization was caused by 3 independent SNP mutations in D23580 that are shared across ST313 lineage 2, suggesting that the ability to catabolise this carbon source has been negatively selected during ST313 evolution.
The data revealed a novel plasmid maintenance system involving a plasmid-encoded CysS cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase, highlighting the power of large-scale comparative multi-condition analyses to pinpoint key phenotypic differences between bacterial pathovariants.
Ownership, Coverage, Utilisation and Maintenance of Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) in Bamenda, Santa and Tiko Health Districts in Cameroon  IntroductionThe Bamenda, Santa and Tiko Health Districts are in the highest malaria transmission strata of Cameroon.
The purpose of this study was to explore the indicators of ownership and utilisation as well as maintenance of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) in three health districts in Cameroon.
MethodsA cross-sectional household survey involving 1,251 households was conducted in the Bamenda, Santa and Tiko Health Districts in Cameroon.
ResultsThe average number of LLINs per household was higher in the Bamenda Health District (BHD) compared to the Tiko Health District (THD) (2.5{+/-}1.4 vs 2.4{+/-}1.6) as well as the household ownership at least one LLIN (93.3% vs. 88.9%).
The proportion of the defacto population with universal utilisation was higher in BHD compared to THD (13.1% vs 0.2%).
In multinomial regression analysis, households in the SHD (OR = 0.4, 95% = C.I; 0.2 - 0.8, p = 6.10x10-3), were less likely to own at least one LLIN, while those in the BHD (OR = 1.3, 95% = C.I; 0.8 - 2.1, p = 0.33) were more likely to maintain LLINs compared to those in THD.
ConclusionOwnership of LLINs was low in SHD and THD in comparison to the goal of one LLIN for every two household members.
Overall, LLINs coverage and accessibility was still low after the free Mass Distribution Campaigns (MDCs), making it difficult for all household members to effectively use LLINs.
Spatio-temporal dynamics of dengue in Brazil: seasonal travelling waves and determinants of regional synchrony  Dengue continues to be the most important vector-borne viral disease globally and in Brazil, where more than 1.4 million cases and over 500 deaths were reported in 2016.
Mosquito control programmes and other interventions have not stopped the alarming trend of increasingly large epidemics in the past few years.\n\nHere, we analyzed monthly dengue cases reported in Brazil between 2001 and 2016 to better characterize the key drivers of dengue epidemics.
Spatio-temporal analysis revealed recurring travelling waves of disease occurrence.
Using wavelet methods, we characterised the average seasonal pattern of dengue in Brazil, which starts in the western states of Acre and Rondonia, then travels eastward to the coast before reaching the northeast of the country.
Only two states in the north of Brazil (Roraima and Amapa) did not follow the countrywide pattern and had inconsistent timing of dengue epidemics throughout the study period.\n\nWe also explored epidemic synchrony and timing of annual dengue cycles in Brazilian regions.
Using gravity style models combined with climate factors, we showed that both human mobility and vector ecology contribute to spatial patterns of dengue occurrence.\n\nThis study offers a characterization of the spatial dynamics of dengue in Brazil and its drivers, which could inform intervention strategies against dengue and other arboviruses.\n\nAuthor summaryIn this paper we studied the synchronization of dengue epidemics in Brazilian regions.
We found that a typical dengue season in Brazil can be described as a wave travelling from the western part of the country towards the east, with the exception of the two most northern equatorial states that experienced inconsistent seasonality of dengue epidemics.\n\nWe found that the spatial structure of dengue cases is driven by both climate and human mobility patterns.
In particular, precipitation was the most important factor for the seasonality of dengue at finer spatial resolutions.\n\nOur findings increase our understanding of large scale dengue patterns and could be used to enhance national control programs against dengue and other arboviruses.
A population of bang-bang switches of defective interfering particles makes within-host dynamics of dengue virus controllable  The titre of virus in a dengue patient and the duration of this viraemia has a profound effect on whether or not a mosquito will become infected when it feeds on the patient and this, in turn is a key driver of the magnitude of a dengue outbreak.
As mosquitoes require 100-1000 times more virus to become infected than a patient, the transmission of dengue virus from a patient to a mosquito is a vulnerability that may be able to be targeted to improve disease control.
The intrinsic variability in the within-host dynamics of viraemias is explored for a population of patients using the method of population of models (POMs).
A dataset from 207 patients is used to calibrate 20,000 models for the infection kinetics for each of the four dengue virus serotypes.
The effect of adding defective dengue virus interfering particles to patients as a therapeutic is evaluated using the calibrated POMs in a bang-bang optimal control setting.\n\nAuthor summaryDengue virions with deletions or defects in their genomes can be recovered from dengue patients.
These defective viruses can only replicate with the assistance of fully functional viruses and they reduce the yield of the fully functional viruses.
They are known as defective interfering (DI) particles.
By administering additional, defined, DI particles to patients it may be possible to reduce the titre and duration of their viraemia.
This, in turn may reduce the severity of the disease and the likelihood that dengue virus will be passed from the patient to a mosquito vector.
This study estimates the number of DI particles that would need to be administered, and over what period, to have a significant effect on patient viraemia and subsequent dengue fever severity.
First genome-wide association study of non-severe malaria in two birth cohorts in Benin: hints towards the involvement of the STAT3 pathway.
Recent research efforts to identify genes involved in the susceptibility to P. falciparum malaria have focused on severe forms of malaria, with several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and multi-center analyses published this past decade.
Here we present the first GWAS performed on mild malaria susceptibility in young children, designed to identify genetic variants involved in innate immunity or innate resistance mechanisms.
Two cohorts of infants from southern Benin (525 and 250 individuals respectively), used as discovery and replication cohorts, were closely followed from birth to 18-24 months of age, with an assessment of a space-and time-dependent risk of exposure to vector bites.
GWAS was performed on 15.5 million genotyped and imputed variants, with the susceptibility of infants to mild malaria attacks and to malaria infections as a whole (both symptomatic and asymptomatic).
Infant susceptibility to malaria was assessed by considering all malaria events occurring during the follow-up using a Cox-model for recurrent events.
We found strong statistical support for a role of PTPRT, a tyrosine phosphatase receptors involved in STAT3 pathway, with the protection against both mild malaria attacks and malaria infections (p=9.70x10-8 and p=1.78x10-7 respectively in the discovery cohort, and both p < 0.05 in the replication cohort).
Furthermore, our study highlights several other genes, among them, UROC1, ACER3 and the PLAG2 cluster, whose biological functions are relevant in malaria infection.
Results show that despite the difficulty of setting up such longitudinal field studies, GWAS on non-severe malaria can successfully identify new candidate genes and inform physiological mechanisms underlying natural protection against malaria.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMalaria remains a major worldwide public health problem with circa 219 million cases and 435,000 deaths per year.
As for many infectious diseases, the genetics of the host plays a role in the disease course.
So far, most studies on such genetic factors focused on severe malaria forms.
Our study aimed to find factors associated with simple forms (asymptomatic forms and uncomplicated clinical forms).
We used dense genome-wide data of two cohorts of infants closely followed during two years in Benin, and we incorporated an environmental risk of exposure estimated at individual level from entomological, climatic, and environmental data.
This allowed us to unravel several genes that appear to play a role in the susceptibility to malaria infection, thus demonstrating the feasibility of a genome-wide approach on non-severe forms.
Functional studies are needed to confirm the role of the genetic factors highlighted here.
Health seeking behaviour and cost of fever treatment to households in a malaria endemic setting of northern Ghana: A cross sectional study  BackgroundThis study examined the health seeking behaviours and cost of treatment of malaria to households in the Kassena-Nankana district of Ghana.\n\nMethodsA cross-sectional household survey was conducted between July and September 2015.
Individuals who had an episode of fever or malaria in the past two weeks identified during routine Health and Demographic Surveillance System data collection were selected for the study.
Socio-demographic characteristics, treatment seeking behaviours and cost of treatment of malaria were obtained from the patient perspective.\n\nResultsOut of the 1,845 households visited, 21.3% (393/1,845) reported to have had an episode of fever or malaria in the past two weeks.
Of the 393 people with malaria, 66.9% (263/393) reported taking an antimalarial.
About 53.6% (141/263) of the antimalarials were obtained from formal healthy facilities.
About 36.1% (95/263) reported to have taken Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, 35.4 % (93/263) took Artesunate-Amodiaquine and 21.7% (57/263) took Artemether-Lumefantrine.
Only 49.6%% (195/393) of the study participants had their blood sample taken for illness (microscopic or Rapid Diagnostic Test).
Only 23.6% (62/263) took antimalarial within 24 hours of the onset of illness.
The overall average costs (direct and indirect cost) incurred by households per malaria treatment was GH{cents}27.82/US$7.32 (range: GH{cents}0.2/ US$0.05 - GH{cents}200/ US$52.63).
The average cost incurred in the treatment of malaria by those who were enrolled into the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) was GH{cents}24.75/US$6.51 and those not enrolled was GH{cents}43.95/US$11.57.\n\nConclusionsPrompt treatment such as treatment within 24 hours of onset of malaria was low.
The average costs to households per malaria treatment was GH{cents}27.82/US$7.32 and the preferred antimalarial was Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine.
There was a positive effect of NHIS enrolment on cost of treatment as the insured incurred less cost (US$5 less) in treatment than the uninsured.
Dengue and Chikungunya among Febrile Outpatients in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo: a cross-sectional study  BackgroundPathogens causing acute fever, with the exception of malaria, remain largely unidentified in sub-Saharan Africa, given the local unavailability of diagnostic tests and the broad differential diagnosis.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsWe conducted a cross-sectional study including outpatient acute febrile syndromes in both children and adults, between November 2015 and June 2016 in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo.
Serological and molecular diagnostic tests for arboviral infections were performed on blood, including PCR and NS1-RDT for acute, and ELISA and IFAT for past infections.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceAmong 342 patients, aged 2 to 68 years, 45.3% tested positive on malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test.
However, 87.7% received antimalarial and 64.3% antibacterial treatment.
Further investigation among 235 fever cases revealed 19 (8.1%) acute dengue and 2 (0.9%) acute chikungunya infections, with an important proportion of participants already exposed to flaviviridae (possibly dengue) and alphaviridae (possibly chikungunya) in the past, namely 30.2 % and 26.4% respectively.
We found no evidence of exposure to Zika nor yellow fever virus.\n\nAuthor SummarySam Proesmans is a medical doctor, currently doing a fellowship in internal medicine at the University of Antwerp, Belgium.
He holds a Master of Public Health from Columbia University, New York City, USA.
His primary research interest lies in infectious diseases, from a public health point of view and he believes that this study is proof that the differential diagnosis should include arboviral infection, given the hitherto unseen evidence of high arbivirus infection rates in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in that they are mostly misdiagnosed as malaria or bacterial infections.
Effects of long-lasting insecticide net (LLINs) ownership/ utilisation indicators on annual household malaria episodes (AHMEs) in Bamenda, Santa and Tiko Health Districts in Cameroon  IntroductionHousehold residents in malaria endemic areas are at high risk of multiple malaria episodes per year.
This study investigated the annual household malaria episodes (AHMEs) in three health districts in Cameroon.
MethodsA community-based cross-sectional household survey using a multi-stage cluster design was conducted 2 - 3 years post campaign to assess long-lasting insecticide net (LLINs) ownership, utilisation, and maintenance as well as demographic characteristics.
Multinomial regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with household LLIN ownership, utilization, and AHME.
ResultsHousehold LLINs ownership, de-facto population with universal utilisation, and AHME were respectively, 92.5%, 16.0%, and 83.4%; thus, 4 out of 25 household residents effectively used LLINs the previous night.
AHME was significantly (p < 0.05) associated with age and gender (OR; 1.6, 95% C.I; 1.1 - 2.3) of household head, health district (OR; 2.8, 95% C.I; 1.1 - 7.2) and tiredness (OR; 2.6, 95% C.I; 1.0 - 6.3).
The overall average cost for the treatment of malaria was 6,399.4{+/-}4,892.8Fcfa (11.1{+/-}8.5US$).
ConclusionsThe proportion of households with at least one LLIN and those with at least one AHME were high.
Findings are of concern given that average cost for the treatment of malaria represents a potentially high economic burden.
The results outlined in this paper provide an important tool for the examination of the deficiencies in LLINs regular and universal utilisation.

A new framework for the study of apicomplexan diversity across environments  Apicomplexans are a group of microbial eukaryotes that contain some of the most well-studied parasites, including widespread intracellular pathogens of mammals such as Toxoplasma and Plasmodium (the agent of malaria), and emergent pathogens like Cryptosporidium and Babesia.
In this study we analyze the distribution of apicomplexans across a range of both host-associated and free-living environments, covering animal hosts from cnidarians to mammals, and ecosystems from soils to fresh and marine waters.
Using publicly available small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene databases, high-throughput environmental sequencing (HTES) surveys such as Tara Oceans and VAMPS, as well as our own generated HTES data, we developed an apicomplexan reference database, which includes the largest apicomplexan SSU rRNA tree available to date and encompasses comprehensive sampling of this group and their closest relatives.
Analyzing the diversity and distribution of apicomplexans in HTES studies with this curated reference database also showed a widespread, and quantitatively important, presence of apicomplexans across a variety of free-living environments.
This revision is most striking in marine environments, where potentially the most diverse apicomplexans apparently exist, but have not yet been formally recognized.
The new database will be useful for both microbial ecology and epidemiological studies, and provide valuable reference for medical and veterinary diagnosis especially in cases of emerging, zoonotic, and cryptic infections.\n\nAuthor SummaryApicomplexans are important animal and human parasites, but little is known about their distribution and diversity in the natural environment.
We have developed a phylogenetically informed and manually curated reference database for the SSU rRNA barcode gene, and analyzed all publicly available sequences from a broad range of environments, providing a needed framework to analyze high-throughput environmental sequencing (HTES) data.
The reference database and the amplicon sequences identified a striking diversity of apicomplexans in the environment, including habitats not usually associated with this group (e.g.
The phylogenetic framework will underpin microbial ecology studies and provide valuable resources for medical and veterinary biology.
Is Anopheles gambiae a natural host of Wolbachia?
Wolbachia (Alphaproteobacteria, Rickettsiales) is an intraovarially-transmitted symbiont of insects able to exert striking phenotypes, including reproductive manipulations and pathogen blocking.
Although Wolbachia is present in the majority of terrestrial arthropods, including many disease vectors, it was considered absent from Anopheles gambiae mosquitos, the main vectors of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.
In 2014, Wolbachia sequences were detected in A. gambiae samples collected in Burkina Faso.
Subsequently, similar evidence came from collections all over Africa, revealing a high Wolbachia 16S sequence diversity, low abundance, and a lack of congruence between host and symbiont phylogenies.
Here, we reanalyze and discuss recent evidence on the presence of Wolbachia sequences in A. gambiae.
We find that although detected at increasing frequencies, the unusual properties of these Wolbachia sequences render them insufficient to diagnose natural infections in A. gambiae.
Future studies should focus on uncovering the origin of Wolbachia sequence variants in Anopheles and seeking sequence-independent evidence for this new symbiosis.
Understanding the ecology of Anopheles mosquitos and their interactions with Wolbachia will be key in designing successful, integrative approaches to limit malaria spread.
Although the prospect of using Wolbachia to fight malaria is intriguing, the newly discovered strains do not bring it closer to realization.\n\nSignificanceAnopheles gambiae mosquitos are the main vectors of malaria, threatening around half of the worlds population.
The bacterial symbiont Wolbachia can interfere with disease transmission by other important insect vectors, but until recently it was thought to be absent from natural A. gambiae populations.
Here, we critically analyze the genomic, metagenomic, PCR, imaging and phenotypic data presented in support of the presence of natural Wolbachia infections in A. gambiae.
We find that they are insufficient to diagnose Wolbachia infections and argue for the need of obtaining robust data confirming basic Wolbachia characteristics in this system.
Determining Wolbachia infection status of Anopheles is critical due to its potential to influence Anopheles population structure and Plasmodium transmission.
Serological evidence of dengue fever and associated factors in health facilities in Borena Zone, Southern Ethiopia.
BackgroundDengue fever is a re-emerging public health threat in Ethiopia.
In this study the seroprevalence and associated risk factors of dengue virus infection were assessed in Borena Zone health facilities.\n\nMethodsAn institution based cross-sectional study was conducted from May to August, 2016.
A total of 519 consecutive acute febrile patients attending the outpatient departments of Teltelle health Center, Yabello and Moyale Hospital were enrolled.
Data on socio-demographic and environmental risk factors were collected using structured questionnaire.
Three to five milliliter blood samples were collected from all participants and screened for dengue virus exposure using indirect immunofluorescent assay.\n\nResultThe overall prevalence of anti-DENV IgG and IgM was 22.9% and 7.9% respectively.
The relatively higher IgM versus IgG, absence of trend with age and little or no correlation with the assessed possible risk factors except being male (AOR=1.72; 95%CI 1.01-2.94), place of residence (AOR=0.37;95%CL 0.21-0.64) that had higher rate of exposure and recall of a recent mosquito bite (AOR=2.98; 95%CI 1.51-5.89) probably imply recent and/or ongoing active transmission.\n\nConclusionThis study showed dengue fever could potentially emerge as public health threat in the study area.
On top, the observed low awareness of participants underline the urgent need for further systematic studies to determine the environmental, and host factors that determine the extent of exposure to dengue virus infection in the area for appropriate control and prevention planning.\n\nAuthor summaryDengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease of global health problem where Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are the main vector.
It is endemic in most tropical and sub-tropical countries with an estimated 96 million infections resulting in clinical disease annually.
So, the current study were conducted among febrile patients who were attending health institutions to document seroprevalence and associated risk factors of DENV infection in the southern part of the country.
The study stated the presence of antibodies against DENV infection in study areas, the ringing bell message for those who were involved in health sectors.
Gender and residence were significantly associated with the prevalence of anti-DENV IgG seropositivity.
In addition, individuals who have experience of recent mosquito bite were identified as the risk factors of DENV infection.
Antimalarial drug mefloquine kills both trophozoite and cyst stages of Entamoeba  Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite which infects approximately 50 million people worldwide, resulting in an estimated 70,000 deaths every year.
Since the 1960s E. histolytica infection has been successfully treated with metronidazole.
However, drawbacks to metronidazole therapy exist, including adverse effects, length of treatment, and the need for additional drugs to prevent transmission.
In this study we identified the antimalarial drug mefloquine as possessing more potent, rapid, amoebicidal in vitro activity against E. histolytica trophozoites than metronidazole.
We also showed that mefloquine could kill the cysts of a closely related reptilian parasite Entamoeba invadens unlike metronidazole.
Additionally, mefloquine is known to possess a much longer half-life in human patients than metronidazole.
This property, along with mefloquines rapid and broad action against E. histolytica position it as a promising new drug candidate against this widespread and devastating disease.\n\nAuthor SummaryEvery year, around 70,000 people worldwide die from infection by the intestinal parasite Entamoeba histolytica, despite the widespread availability of the drug metronidazole as a treatment.
In this report we discovered that the antimalarial drug mefloquine killed E. histolytica more potently and more rapidly than metronidazole, and, importantly, also killed the transmissible cyst stage of another Entamoeba species used as a model system.
These findings make mefloquine an excellent candidate for an alternative drug to the current standard, with a simpler course of treatment and a more effective strategy to reduce the spread of this disease.
scAlign: a tool for alignment, integration and rare cell identification from scRNA-seq data  scRNA-seq dataset integration occurs in different contexts, such as the identification of cell type-specific differences in gene expression across conditions or species, or batch effect correction.
We present scAlign, an unsupervised deep learning method for data integration that can incorporate partial, overlapping or a complete set of cell labels, and estimate per-cell differences in gene expression across datasets.
scAlign performance is state-of-the-art and robust to cross-dataset variation in cell type-specific expression and cell type composition.
We demonstrate that scAlign identifies a rare cell population likely to drive malaria transmission.
Target Binding and Sequence Prediction With LSTMs  Deep recurrent neural networks (DRNNs) have recently demonstrated strong performance in sequential data analysis, such as natural language processing.
These capabilities make them a promising tool for inferential analysis of sequentially structured bioinformatics data as well.
Here, we assessed the ability of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a class of DRNNs, to predict properties of proteins based on their primary structures.
The proposed architecture is trained and tested on two different datasets to predict whether a given sequence falls into a certain class or not.
The first dataset, directly imported from Uniprot, was used to train the network on whether a given protein contained or did not contain a conserved sequence (homeodomain), and the second dataset, derived by literature mining, was used to train a network on whether a given protein binds or doesnt bind to Artemisinin, a drug typically used to treat malaria.
In each case, the model was able to differentiate between the two different classes of sequences it was given with high accuracy, illustrating successful learning and generalization.
Upon completion of training, an ROC curve was created using the homeodomain and artemisinin validation datasets.
The AUC of these datasets was 0.80 and 0.87 respectively, further indicating the models effectiveness.
Furthermore, using these trained models, it was possible to derive a protocol for sequence detection of homeodomain and binding motif, which are well-documented in literature, and a known Artemisinin binding site, respectively [1-3].
Estimating the probable cause of recurrence in Plasmodium vivax malaria: relapse, reinfection or recrudescence?
BackgroundRelapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is the main cause of vivax malaria in many parts of Asia.
However at the individual patient level, recurrence of a blood stage infection following treatment within the endemic area can be either a relapse (from dormant liver-stage parasites), a recrudescence (blood-stage treatment failure), or a reinfection (following a new mosquito inoculation).
Time-of-event and genetic data provide complimentary information about the cause of P. vivax recurrence, but the optimum approach to genotyping and analysis remains uncertain.\n\nMethodsIndividual-level data from two large drug trials in acute vivax malaria patients (Vivax History: VHX; Best Primaquine Dose: BPD) conducted on the Thailand-Myanmar border with follow-up of one year were pooled (n=1299).
A total of 710 isolates from both acute and recurrent P. vivax episodes were genotyped using 3-9 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers.
These pooled data were analyzed using a novel population statistical model incorporating an assessment of genetic relatedness, treatment drug administered, and the time-to-recurrence.\n\nResults99% of genotyped recurrences in individuals who did not receive primaquine (n=365) were estimated to be relapses.
In comparison, 14% of genotyped recurrences (n=121) were estimated to be relapses following high-dose supervised primaquine.
By comparing episodes across individuals (90194 comparisons), the false-positive rate of relapse identification using genetic data alone was estimated to be 2.2%.
We estimated the true failure rate after high-dose primaquine (7mg/kg total dose) to be 2.6% in this epidemiological context, substantially lower the reinfection unadjusted estimate of 12%.
Simulation studies show that 9 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers suffice to discriminate between recurrence states.
Drug exposures reflected by plasma carboxy-primaquine concentrations were not predictive of treatment failure, but did identify non-adherence.\n\nConclusionUsing this novel statistical model, relapse of P. vivax malaria could be distinguished reliably from reinfection.
This showed that in this population supervised high-dose primaquine could avert up to 99% of relapses.
In low transmission settings, microsatellite genotyping combined with time-to-event data can accurately discriminate between the different causes of recurrent P. vivax malaria.\n\nAuthor summaryOne hundred years ago, Plasmodium vivax, the most globally diverse cause of human malaria, was present across most of the old-world, throughout tropical and temperate climes.
Its main evolutionary advantage over Plasmodium falciparum, responsible for the most deadly type of human malaria, is its ability to stay dormant in the liver, emerging weeks to years later causing recurring illness and continuing transmission.
The dormant liver-stage parasites are called hypnozoites.
A recurrent infection can either be hypnozoite-derived (a relapse), a blood-stage treatment failure (recrudescence), or from a new mosquito bite (a reinfection).
Parasite genetic data alone cannot resolve the different possibilities.
We developed a novel probabilistic framework which uses both epidemiological and genetic data to determine the most likely cause of vivax recurrence at the individual level.
We applied this method to the largest available pooled clinical trial data from Southeast Asia incorporating information from highly polymorphic microsatellite markers, drug treatments received and time-to-recurrent illness.
This analysis provides a tool for estimating probabilities of relapse, recrudescence and reinfection and, importantly, shows that hypnozoiticidal high-dose primaquine radical cure is much more effective than previously thought.
Causes of death among hospitalized adults with dengue fever in Tainan, 2015: emphasis on cardiac events and bacterial infections  IntroductionThe 2015 dengue outbreak in southern Taiwan caused substantial mortality rates in the elderly.
We analyzed here the causes of death among adults with dengue.\n\nMethodsThe retrospective study was conducted at a medical center in Tainan from the 1st of August to 31th of December in the year 2015.
The detection of the dengue NS1 antigen IgM or viral RNA in patients blood were used to diagnose dengue.
Clinical courses and causes of death were retrieved from chart reviews by two intensivists.\n\nResultsThere were 4,488 cases of dengue diagnosed in the study hospital, and these cases had an in-hospital case fatality rate of 1.34% (60 cases).
Of these, the mean age was 73 years and gender did not predict outcome.
Twenty-eight (46.7%) cases died of severe dengue, and 29 (48.3%) deaths were possibly caused by dengue-related complications, which were mostly secondary infections (24 cases).
Most of the families of fatal case (70%) signed do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders prior to the patients death.
When the dengue epidemic peaked, 13 cardiac arrest events, including out-of-hospital (5 events) and in-hospital (8) cardiac arrests at the emergency department, occurred within four weeks of the dengue epidemic.
Of the 40 cases that had early death (occurring within one week after hospitalization), 60% died of severe dengue.
In contrast, 50% of the 20 deaths that occurred later than one week after hospitalization were related to hospital-acquired infections, mainly pneumonia.\n\nConclusionThe elderly that experience dengue fever may die of severe dengue early or die of secondary infections later.
Cardiac arrests can also occur unpredictably at the first aids, which highlight the need of professional and patient education regarding the danger signs that are related to severe dengue in an epidemic setting.\n\nAuthor summaryThe 2015 dengue outbreak in Tainan City caused substantial deaths among the elderly.
The main causes of death were severe dengue and its complications.
We here highlight the deaths caused by heart complications of dengue that the elderly has underlying cardiovascular comorbidities is more prone to be involved.
The presentations of heart complications vary, ranging from arrythmia to myocarditis and to unexpected cardiac arrest.
Clinicians should carefully evaluate and monitor the heart function of patients with severe dengue and provide timing intervention.
Secondary infections or healthcare-associated infections may occur throughout the whole hospitalized course.
They were also the leading causes of death during the late or recovery phase of dengue in the study.
Judicious application of antimicrobial agents and early elimination of infection source may be beneficial.
Overall, the substantial deaths during this outbreak may be related to low public awareness of dengue, emergency department overclouding, and lack of clinical experience.
Professional and public education regarding the danger signs that are related to severe dengue is necessary in an epidemic setting.
Premeiotic and meiotic failures associate with hybrid male sterility in the Anopheles gambiae complex  Hybrid male sterility contributes to speciation by restricting gene flow between related taxa.
Detailed cytological characterizations of reproductive organs in hybrid males is important for identifying phenotypes that can help guide searches of speciation genes.
To investigate possible cellular causes of hybrid male sterility, we performed crosses between closely related species of the Anopheles gambiae complex: An.
merus with An.
gambiae or An.
We demonstrate that hybrid male sterility in African malaria mosquitoes involves two defects in the reciprocal crosses: a premeiotic arrest of germline stem cells in degenerate testes and a failure of the reductional meiotic division of primary spermatocytes in normal-like testes.
The premeiotic arrest in degenerate testes of hybrids is accompanied by a strong suppression of meiotic and postmeiotic genes.
Unlike pure species, sex chromosomes in normal-like testes of F1 hybrids are largely unpaired during meiotic prophase I and all chromosomes show various degrees of insufficient condensation.
Instead of entering reductional division in meiosis I, primary spermatocytes prematurely undergo an equational mitotic division producing nonmotile diploid sperm.
Thus, our study identified cytogenetic errors in interspecies hybrids that arise during the early stages of postzygotic isolation.

Assessment of the new World Health Organization’s dengue classification for predicting severity of illness and level of healthcare required  The objective of this observational study was to assess the validity of the new dengue classification proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2009 and to develop pragmatic guidelines for case triage and management.
This retrospective study involved 357 laboratory-confirmed cases of dengue infection diagnosed at King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia over a 4-year period from 2014 to 2017.
The sensitivity of the new classification for identifying severe cases was limited (65.0%) but higher than the old one (30 0%).
It had a higher sensitivity for identifying patients who needed advanced healthcare compared to the old one (72.0% versus 32.0%, respectively).
We propose adding decompensation of chronic diseases and thrombocytopenia-related bleeding to the category of severe dengue in the new classification.
This modification improves sensitivity from 72.0% to 97.5% for identifying patients who need advanced healthcare without altering specificity (96.7%).
It also improves sensitivity in predicting severe outcomes from 32% to 88.0%.
In conclusion, the new classification had a low sensitivity for identifying patients needing advanced care and for predicting morbidity and mortality.
We propose to include decompensation of chronic diseases and thrombocytopenia-related bleeding to the category of severe dengue in the new classification to improve the sensitivity of predicting cases requiring advanced care.\n\nAuthor summaryDengue fever, the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease in human, has been conventionally classified into four main categories: non-classical, classical, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome.
As a consequence, the World Health organization proposed in 2008 a new classification that divides dengue into two categories: non-severe and severe dengue; the non-severe dengue is further divided into two categories: dengue with warning signs and dengue without warning signs.
In this retrospective study we reviewed 357 cases of dengue diagnosed in our institution over a 4-year period to assess the validity of the new dengue classification in order to develop pragmatic guidelines for case triage and management in the Emergency Departments.
We found that the sensitivity of the new classification for identifying severe cases was limited even though it had a higher sensitivity for identifying patients who needed advanced healthcare compared to the old one.
We propose adding decompensation of chronic diseases and low platelets-related bleeding to the category of severe dengue in the new classification.
This modification dramatically improves the sensitivity for identifying patients who need advanced healthcare and the sensitivity to predict severe outcomes.
Life on the margin: rainwater tanks facilitate overwintering of the dengue vector, Aedes aegypti, in a sub-tropical climate.
A key determinant of insect persistence in marginal habitats is the ability to tolerate environmental extremes such as temperature.
Aedes aegypti is highly invasive and little is known about the physiological sensitivity of the species to fluctuating temperature regimes at the lower critical threshold.
Daily winter temperatures were measured in common Australian larval habitats, replicated in environmental chambers, and used to investigate the effect of fluctuating temperatures on the development and survival of tropical and subtropical strains of Australian Ae.
Development was slow for all treatments but both strains were able to complete development to the adult stage, suggesting previous models underestimate the potential for the species to persist in eastern Australia.
Results suggested that thermal buffering in large volume habitats, and water that persists for greater than 32 days, will facilitate completion of the life cycle during sub-tropical winters.
Furthermore, we provide a non-linear estimate of the lower critical temperature of Ae.
aegypti that suggests the current threshold may be incorrect.
Our study demonstrates that the current re-introduction of water storage containers such as rainwater tanks, into major Australian population centres will increase the risk of Ae.
aegypti establishment by permitting year-round development south of its current distribution.
A human ex vivo dengue virus neutralization assay identifies priority antibodies and epitopes for vaccines and therapeutics.
BackgroundDengue is the most prevalent arboviral disease, for which neither effective vaccines nor antivirals are available.
Clinical trials with Dengvaxia, the first licensed dengue vaccine, show the conventional in vitro plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) failed to discriminate between neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies.
A number of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were characterized by PRNT as being neutralizers of virus infectivity for mammalian cells.\n\nMethodolody/Principle findingsWe developed a neutralization assay and tested the capacity of 12 mAbs to neutralize the infectiousness of dengue patient viremic blood in mosquitoes.
We identified minimum concentrations of a subset of mAbs required to achieve dengue virus neutralization, and modelled the impact of a therapeutic mAb candidate on viremia.\n\nFive of the 12 mAbs (14c10, 2D22, 1L12, 747(4)B7, 753(3)C10), all of which target quaternary epitopes, potently inhibited dengue virus infection of Ae.
The potency of several mAbs was compromised in the context of patients with secondary serological profiles, possibly reflecting competition between the exogenously-added mAbs and the patients own antibody responses at or near the target epitopes.
The minimum concentrations that mAbs neutralized DENV ranged from 0.1 - 5 {micro}g/mL.
An Fc-disabled variant of mAb (14c10-LALA) was as potent as its parent mAb.
Within-host mathematical modelling suggests infusion of 14c10-LALA could bring about rapid acceleration of viremia resolution in a typical patient.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceThese data delivered a unique assessment of anti-viral potency of a panel of human mAbs.
Results support the advancement of dengue virus neutralization assays, and the development of therapeutics against flaviviruses, to which dengue virus and Zika virus belong.\n\nAuthor summaryDengue is the most prevalent arboviral disease affecting humans.
Antibody-mediated immunity against dengue is also not well-understood, as shown by the failure of the conventional neutralization assay used to predict the efficacy of Dengvaxia, the first licensed vaccine for the disease.
To this end, we developed a novel virus neutralization assay, employing Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and viremic blood from dengue patients, to examine the virus-neutralizing potency of 12 human-derived monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).
While all of these mAbs neutralized dengue virus using the conventional assay, seven of them failed to block dengue virus infections of mosquitoes using our assay.
The remaining five mAbs neutralized at least one serotype of dengue virus and the minimum neutralizing concentrations of range from 0.1 - 5 {micro}g/mL.
Using the minimum neutralizing concentration of a therapeutic mAb candidate, we investigated the impact of the mAb on viremia using a mathematical model and found the mAb accelerated the reduction of viremia.
The results support the advancement of dengue virus neutralization assays, and the development of therapeutics for dengue.
The Isolation and Identification of Fungi Gathered from Districts in Bangkok, Thailand Where Dengue Fever Is at Epidemic Levels  BackgroundThe Aedes mosquito is a major vector of many important diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever.
Biological methods of controlling mosquitos are desirable because they are ecologically friendlier, safer, and more cost effective than chemical and physical methods of controlling mosquitos.\n\nMethodsWater samples in the mosquitoes breeding containers from districts in Bangkok were collected from the mosquitoes breeding containers situated in seven districts of Bangkok, Thailand.
Purified DNA specimens were amplified in a PCR reaction with universal primers of ITS1 and ITS4.
All the PCR product was sequencing, alignment and comparing the homologous sequence in GenBank database.\n\nResultsFourteen strains of fungi were isolated.
The most commonly found strain was Penicillium citrinum, which was discovered in six of the 30 isolated fungi samples.\n\nConclusionBiological control strategies for the mosquito population should be further investigated because they are considered to be ecologically friendlier, safer, and more cost effective than chemical insecticides.
Space-time clusters of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika cases in the city of Rio de Janeiro  Brazil is a dengue-endemic country where all four dengue virus serotypes circulate and cause seasonal epidemics.
Recently, chikungunya and Zika viruses were also introduced.
In Rio de Janeiro city, the three diseases co-circulated for the first time in 2015-2016, resulting in what is known as the  triple epidemic.
In this study, we identify space-time clusters of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, to understand the dynamics and interaction between these simultaneously circulating arboviruses in a densely populated and heterogeneous city.\n\nWe conducted a spatio-temporal analysis of weekly notified cases of the three diseases in Rio de Janeiro city (July 2015 - January 2017), georeferenced by 160 neighbourhoods, using Kulldorffs scan statistic with discrete Poisson probability models.\n\nThere were 26549, 13662, and 35905 notified cases of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, respectively.
The 17 dengue clusters and 15 Zika clusters were spread all over the city, while the 14 chikungunya clusters were more concentrated in the North and Downtown areas.
Zika clusters persisted over a longer period of time.
The multivariate scan statistic - used to analyse the three diseases simultaneously - detected 17 clusters, nine of which included all three diseases.\n\nThis is the first study exploring space-time clustering of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in an intraurban area.
In general, the clusters did not coincide in time and space.
This is probably the result of the competition between viruses for host resources, and of vector-control attitudes promoted by previous arbovirus outbreaks.
The main affected area - the North region - is characterised by a combination of high population density and low human development index, highlighting the importance of targeting interventions in this area.
Spatio-temporal scan statistics have the potential to direct interventions to high-risk locations in a timely manner and should be considered as part of the municipal surveillance routine as a tool to optimize prevention strategies.\n\nAuthor summaryDengue, an arboviral disease transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, has been endemic in Brazil for decades, but vector-control strategies have not led to a significant reduction in the disease burden and were not sufficient to prevent chikungunya and Zika entry and establishment in the country.
In Rio de Janeiro city, the first Zika and chikungunya epidemics were detected between 2015-2016, coinciding with a dengue epidemic.
Understanding the behaviour of these diseases in a triple epidemic scenario is a necessary step for devising better interventions for prevention and outbreak response.
We applied scan statistics analysis to detect spatio-temporal clustering for each disease separately and for all three simultaneously.
In general, clusters were not detected in the same locations and time periods, possibly due to competition between viruses for host resources, and change in behaviour of the human population (e.g.
intensified vector-control activities in response to increasing cases of a particular arbovirus).
Neighbourhoods with high population density and social vulnerability should be considered as important targets for interventions.
Particularly in the North region, where clusters of the three diseases exist and the first chikungunya cluster occurred.
The use of space-time cluster detection can direct intensive interventions to high-risk locations in a timely manner.
The Malaria Cell Atlas: a comprehensive reference of single parasite transcriptomes across the complete Plasmodium life cycle  Malaria parasites adopt a remarkable variety of morphological life stages as they transition through multiple mammalian host and mosquito vector environments.
Here we profile the single-cell transcriptomes of thousands of individual parasites, deriving the first high-resolution transcriptional atlas of the entire Plasmodium berghei life cycle.
We then use our atlas to precisely define developmental stages of single cells from three different human malaria parasite species, including parasites isolated directly from infected individuals.
The Malaria Cell Atlas provides both a comprehensive view of gene usage in a complex eukaryotic parasite and an open access reference data set for the study of malaria parasites.
DNA aptamers for the recognition of HMGB1 from Plasmodium falciparum  Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) for malaria are restricted to a few biomarkers and antibody-mediated detection.
However, the expression of commonly used biomarkers varies geographically and the sensibility of immunodetection can be affected by batch-to-batch differences or limited thermal stability.
In this study we aimed to overcome these limitations by identifying a potential biomarker and by developing molecular sensors based on aptamer technology.
Using gene expression databases, ribosome profiling analysis, and structural modeling, we find that the High Mobility Group Box 1 protein (HMGB1) of Plasmodium falciparum is highly expressed, structurally stable and steadily present along all blood-stages of P. falciparum infection.
To develop biosensors, we used in vitro evolution techniques to produce DNA aptamers for the recombinantly expressed HMG-box, the conserved domain of HMGB1.
An evolutionary approach for evaluating the dynamics of aptamer populations suggested three predominant aptamer motifs.
Representatives of the aptamer families were tested for binding parameters to the HMG-box domain using microscale thermophoresis and rapid kinetics.
Dissociation constants of the aptamers varied over two orders of magnitude between nano- and micromolar ranges while the aptamer-HMG-box interaction occurred in less than 30 seconds.
The specificity of aptamer binding to the HMG-box of P. falciparum compared to its human homolog depended on pH conditions.
Altogether, our study proposes HMGB1 as a potential biomarker and a set of sensing aptamers that can be further developed into rapid diagnostic tests for P. falciparum detection.
What is the explanation for Plasmodium vivax malarial recurrence?
Experience of Parasitology Unit of Kinshasa University Hospital of 1982-1983 and 2000-2009  Context and ObjectivesMicroscopy is needed for a study involving the surveillance data of a species like P. vivax, the most widespread in Asia and almost non-existent species in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
The use of microscopy and rapid diagnostics tests (RDTs) approaches are recommended for malaria test.
Considering the advantages and disadvantages of the two, microscopy is more suitable for effective identification of presence of malaria parasites for the surveillance data of P. vivax and other species.
Rapid diagnostics tests fit better for P. falciparum.
This study aimed to revise between the Microscopy and RDTs, which is better for used in city than in rural settings for the surveillance of Plasmodium vivax malarial recurrence in malaria-endemic areas and why?
MethodsIt is a descriptive study of 19,746 laboratory data.
The variables wanted were a positive thick drop and a thin smear with the plasmodial species.
The analyzes were carried out based on prevalences and the software R was used to generate the figures.
The ethics committee of the Department of Tropical Medicine approved this study.
We were using microscopes as our diagnostic tools for malaria surveillance data in the Parasitology Unit.
RDTs are the quickest way to detect and diagnose malaria.
It can be home-based for everyone depending his understand the principles of how it works.
Therefore, this can be used in rural areas because it will be fast to attend to many people.

Microscopes are effective.
Depending on the accurate functionality of the tool and the expertise skill of the technician or scientist.
Therefore, microscopy may have lower opportunity to be used in a rural area because of the complexity, the population and time.
Microscopy has advantages to be important to use in rural areas because of its accuracy and the ability to detect Plasmodiums species than the RDTs.
Lead optimisation of dehydroemetine for repositioned use in malaria  Drug repositioning offers an effective alternative to de novo drug design to tackle the urgent need for novel anti-malarial treatments.
The anti-amoebic compound, emetine dihydrochloride, has been identified as a potent in-vitro inhibitor of the multi-drug resistant strain K1 of Plasmodium falciparum (IC50: 47 nM + 2.1 nM).
2,3-dehydroemetine, a synthetic analogue of emetine dihydrochloride has been claimed to have less cardiotoxic effects than emetine.
The structures of two diastereoisomers of 2,3-dehydroemetine were modelled on the reported emetine binding site on cryo-EM structure 3J7A and it was found that (-)-R,S-dehydroemetine mimicked the bound pose of emetine more closely than (-)-S,S-dehydroisoemetine.
(-)-R,S-dehydroemetine was also found to be highly potent against the multi-drug resistant K1 strain of P. falciparum in comparison with (-)-S,S-dehydroisoemetine, which loses its potency due to the change of configuration at C-1.
In addition to its effect on the asexual erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum, the compounds exhibited gametocidal properties with no cross-resistance against any of the multi-drug resistant strains tested.
Drug interaction studies showed (-)-R,S-dehydroemetine to have synergistic antimalarial activity with atovaquone and proguanil.
Emetine dihydrochloride, and (-)-R,S-dehydroemetine failed to show any inhibition of the hERG potassium channel and displayed atovoquone-like activity on the mitochondrial membrane potential.
New insights into malaria susceptibility from the genomes of 17,000 individuals from Africa, Asia, and Oceania  We conducted a genome-wide association study of host resistance to severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria in over 17,000 individuals from 11 malaria-endemic countries, undertaking a wide ranging analysis which identifies five replicable associations with genome-wide levels of evidence.
Our findings include a newly implicated variant on chromosome 6 associated with risk of cerebral malaria, and the discovery of an erythroid-specific transcription start site underlying the association in ATP2B4.
Previously reported HLA associations cannot be replicated in this dataset.
We estimate substantial heritability of severe malaria (h2 ~ 23%), of which around 10% is explained by the currently identified associations.
Our dataset will provide a major building block for future research on the genetic determinants of disease in these diverse human populations.
Transcriptome analysis of Plasmodium berghei during exo-erythrocytic development  The complex life cycle of malaria parasites requires well-orchestrated stage specific gene expression.
In the vertebrate host the parasites grow and multiply by schizogony in two different environments: within erythrocytes and within hepatocytes.
Whereas erythrocytic parasites are rather well-studied in this respect, relatively little is known about the exo-erythrocytic stages.
In an attempt to fill this gap, we performed genome wide RNA-seq analyses of various exo-erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium berghei including sporozoites, samples from a time-course of liver stage development and detached cells, which contain infectious merozoites and represent the final step in exo-erythrocytic development.
The analysis represents the completion of the transcriptome of the entire life cycle of P. berghei parasites with temporal detailed analysis of the liver stage allowing segmentation of the transcriptome across the progression of the life cycle.
We have used these RNA-seq data from different developmental stages to cluster genes with similar expression profiles, in order to infer their functions.
A comparison with published data of other parasite stages confirmed stage-specific gene expression and revealed numerous genes that are expressed differentially in blood and exo-erythrocytic stages.
One of the most exo-erythrocytic stage-specific genes was PBANKA_1003900, which has previously been annotated as a "gametocyte specific protein".
The promoter of this gene drove high GFP expression in exo-erythrocytic stages, confirming its expression profile seen by RNA-seq.
The comparative analysis of the genome wide mRNA expression profiles of erythrocytic and different exo-erythrocytic stages improves our understanding of gene regulation of Plasmodium parasites and can be used to model exo-erythrocytic stage metabolic networks and identify differences in metabolic processes during schizogony in erythrocytes and hepatocytes.
Opportunities for improved surveillance and control of infectious diseases from age-specific case data  One of the challenges faced by global disease surveillance efforts is the lack of comparability across systems.
Reporting commonly focuses on overall incidence, despite differences in surveillance quality between and within countries.
We present a framework to estimate transmission intensity for dengue virus from age-specific incidence data, and apply it to 363 administrative units in Thailand, Colombia, Brazil and Mexico.
Our estimates correlate well with those derived from seroprevalence data (the gold-standard), capture the expected spatial heterogeneity in risk, and correlate with known environmental drivers of transmission.
Since age-specific counts are routinely collected by many surveillance systems, they represent a unique opportunity to further our understanding of disease burden and risk for many diseases.
Is it possible to eradicate Parasitic diseases without eliminating Poverty?
ContextTalking about Poverty is not obvious without examples, I would like to understand the link between Parasitology, Poverty and Prevention (the three P).
I explain the three P by saying that there is four level of knowledge in Parasitology and the fourth level is the integration with other disciplines including virology with preventive measures, nutrition aspects with denutrition leading by some parasites as Ascaris, economy involving patients income and Poverty.
As a reminder, the first level in Parasitology is the knowledge of the parasitic cycle with an emphasis on the mode of contamination, the second level is that of the implementation of technical or diagnostic means to identify the parasite in the laboratory or the bench and the third level is that of treating infected cases diagnosed in the laboratory.
Specifically, this manuscript aimed to evaluate poverty with the protective measures against the harmful effects of mosquitoes that contribute to the quality of care given to patients of the University Hospital of Kinshasa (UHK).
FindingsResidual mosquito capture, carried out in 31 randomly selected rooms per block and per level in hospital departments, presented the number of 1,144 female mosquitoes (845 Culex, 207 Anopheles and 62 Aedes).
Overall considered, the Mean Mosquito Density (MMD) was 36.2 / mosquito per room (6.9 Anopheles / room, 29.1 Culex / room and 2.1 Aedes / room with an extreme between 0 and 144 mosquitoes / room.
The lowest MMD (6.2 mosquitoes / room) was observed in Block II (clinical biology and microbiology laboratories, delivery and private hospitalization rooms) compared to other hospital blocks that had the highest MMD and statistically identical (ranging between 29.2 and 45.5 mosquitoes / room).
Our observations give a good idea of Poverty inside this hospital and where to concentrate in the prevention of malaria transmission within the hospital.
Regardless of the block considered, it was the ground floor with an MMD of 52.8 mosquitoes / room which were the most dangerous places compared with the first and second floors with MMD respectively 17.6 and 25.6 mosquitoes / room.
ConclusionIn conclusion, the insufficiency of the UHK anti-mosquito measures was obvious.
These should be applied without delay to prevent the risk of infection transmission by mosquitoes, even within the hospital, of hepatitis B virus and strains of Plasmodium falciparum, sometimes highly virulent, which may be concentrated there.
LimitsWe were on the right track and this study needs more research because of its limitations: we investigate and did not find if any of the mosquitoes collected were infected; we did not investigate if the hospital had any patients with a mosquito transmitted disease in the rooms where the mosquitoes were collected.
RecommendationThe recommendation is if it is not possible to eradicate parasitic diseases as malaria without eliminating poverty, then we need to eliminate them both.
Anopheles gambiae TEP1 forms a complex with the coiled-coil domain of LRIM1/APL1C following a conformational change in the thioester domain  The complement-like protein thioester-containing protein 1 (TEP1) is a key factor in the immune response of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae to pathogens.
Multiple allelic variants of TEP1 have been identified in laboratory strains and in the field, and are correlated with distinct immunophenotypes.
TEP1 is tightly regulated by conformational changes induced by cleavage in a protease-sensitive region.
Cleaved TEP1 forms a soluble complex with a heterodimer of two leucine-rich repeat proteins, LRIM1 and APL1C, and precipitates in the absence of this complex.
The molecular structure and oligomeric state of the TEP1/LRIM1/APL1C complex is unclear.
We have analyzed the stability of the cleaved form of four TEP1 alleles.
Soluble TEP1 forms exhibit significant variation in stability from hours to days at room temperature.
Stability is correlated with allelic variation within two specific loops in direct proximity to the thioester bond.
The variable loops are part of an interface between the TED and MG8 domains TEP1 that protect the thioester from hydrolysis.
Engineering specific disulfide bonds to prevent separation of the TED-MG8 interface stabilizes the cleaved form of TEP1 for months at room temperature.
The C-terminal coiled-coil domain of the LRIM1/APL1C complex is sufficient to stabilize the cleaved form of TEP1 in solution but cleaved forms of disulfide-stabilized TEP1 do not interact with LRIM1/APL1C.
This implies that formation of the TEP1cut/LRIM1/APL1C complex is dependent on the same conformational change that induces the precipitation of cleaved TEP1.
Author SummaryThe mosquito Anopheles gambiae is the principal vector for malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa.
A mosquitos own immune system affects how readily it transmits disease.
A protein in A. gambiae called TEP1 is responsible for targeting malaria parasites that traverse the mosquitos midgut.
TEP1 has multiple alleles and some are associated with a stronger immune response to malaria than others.
How genetic variability in TEP1 is linked to phenotypic diversity is not understood.
We show that the variation between TEP1 alleles affects the stability of the protein in solution.
We also show that the different TEP1 alleles have a wide range in stability of the protein, from hours to days.
Engineering disulfide bonds into TEP1 can increase this stability to months.
TEP1 activity in vivo is maintained by a complex of two leucine-rich proteins called LRIM1 and APL1C, which binds TEP1 through its C-terminal coiled-coil domain.
This research advances our molecular understanding of a key immune response that affects the capacity of A. gambiae mosquitoes to transmit malaria.
Model ensembles with different response variables for base and meta models: malaria disaggregation regression combining prevalence and incidence data  Maps of infection risk are a vital tool for the elimination of malaria.
Routine surveillance data of malaria case counts, often aggregated over administrative regions, is becoming more widely available and can better measure low malaria risk than prevalence surveys.
However, aggregation of case counts over large, heterogeneous areas means that these data are often underpowered for learning relationships between the environment and malaria risk.
A model that combines point surveys and aggregated surveillance data could have the benefits of both but must be able to account for the fact that these two data types are different malariometric units.
Here, we train multiple machine learning models on point surveys and then combine the predictions from these with a geostatistical disaggregation model that uses routine surveillance data.
We find that, in tests using data from Colombia and Madagascar, using a disaggregation regression model to combine predictions from machine learning models trained on point surveys improves model accuracy relative to using the environmental covariates directly.
Detecting space-time clusters of dengue fever in Panama after adjusting for vector surveillance data  Long term surveillance of vectors and arboviruses is an integral aspect of disease prevention and control systems in countries affected by increasing risk.
Here, we integrate 13 years of dengue case surveillance and associated Aedes occurrence data across 462 localities in 63 districts to estimate the risk of infection in the Republic of Panama.
Our space-time modelling approach detected the presence of five clusters, which varied by duration, relative risk, and spatial extent after incorporating vector species as covariates.
Dengue prevalence (n = 49,910) was predicted by the presence of resident Aedes aegypti alone, while all other covariates exhibited insignificant statistical relationships with it, including the presence and absence of invasive Aedes albopictus.
Furthermore, the Ae.
aegypti model contained the highest number of districts with more dengue cases than would be expected given baseline population levels.
This implies that arbovirus case surveillance coupled with entomological surveillance can affect cluster detection and risk estimation, improving efforts to understand outbreak dynamics at national scales.
Author SummaryDengue cases have increased in tropical regions worldwide owing to climate change, urbanization, and globalization facilitating the spread of Aedes mosquito vectors.
National surveillance programs monitor trends in dengue fever and inform the public about epidemiological scenarios where outbreak preventive actions are most needed.
Yet, most estimations of dengue risk so far derive only from disease case data, ignoring Aedes occurrence as a key aspect of dengue transmission dynamic.
Here we illustrate how incorporating vector presence and absence as a model covariate can considerably alter the characteristics of space-time cluster estimations of dengue cases.
aegypti has likely been a greater driver of dengue infection in high risk districts of Panama than Ae.
albopictus, and provide a discussion of possible public health implications of both spatial and non-spatial model outcomes.
Erythropoiesis differences in various clinical phases of Dengue fever using Immature Reticulocyte Fraction parameter  Dengue fever is the most common cause of hospitalization in otherwise healthy person.
The incidence rate increases significantly every year, from 0.05 per 100.000 inhabitants in 1968 to 35-40 per 100.000 inhabitants in 2013.
Thrombocytopenia and leucopenia are the most commonly reported changes, whether they are caused by bone marrow suppression or peripheral destruction.
Anemia has also been observed to occur in dengue infection with unknown mechanism.
Immature Reticulocyte Fraction (IRF) is a parameter reflecting the most immature reticulocyte fraction and it can identify the earliest stage of erythropoiesis disorder.
This research aimed to determine the mechanism of erythropoiesis disorders that led to anemia using IRF parameter in the various clinical phases of dengue fever.
This study was a comparative analytical research using secondary data derived from the Dengue-associated Endothelial Cell Dysfunction and Thrombocyte Activation (DECENT) research.
The data was analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test, followed by Friedman test and Mann-Whitney post hoc test.
There were 244 research subjects and the median age was 24 (14-67), with similar ratio of male and female.
The median IRF for all the research subjects was 4.8% with an IQR of 2.4-8.1%.
The fever-phase group showed a median of 1.8% with an IQR of 0.5-2.85%.
The critical-phase group showed a median of 3.6% with an IQR of 1.8- 5.0%, while the median for the recovery-phase group was 7.05% with an IQR of 4.08-11.85%.
The convalescent-phase group showed a median of 7.3 % with an IQR of 3.95-9.3%, and the healthy-control group showed a median of 4.1% with an IQR of 2.2-6.6%.
There was a significant difference in IRF between the groups (p<0.05).
Immature Reticulocyte Fraction in fever phase was significantly different with IRF in other phases and healthy controls (p<0.05).
In the critical phase, IRF was not significantly different from the healthy controls (p=0.218).
Summarizing, there are changes in erythropoiesis activity in various clinical phases of dengue infection.
Erythropoiesis suppression occurred mainly during the fever phase and it started to restore in the critical phase.
In the recovery and convalescent phases, the erythropoiesis activity was increased.
Description and lessons learned from the 2014 Dengue outbreak in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
Knowledge, attitudes and bite prevention practices among those with confirmed Dengue  BackgroundThe frequency and magnitude of Dengue epidemics have increased dramatically in the past 40 years throughout the tropics largely due to unplanned urbanization, globalization and lack of effective mosquito control.
Dar es Salaam, Tanzania has recently experienced Dengue outbreaks that occur with increasing frequency.
Currently, only one serotype is recorded.
Without adequate vector monitoring and control, it is certain that further outbreaks will occur.\n\nMethods/FindingsA retrospective study followed 100 individuals with confirmed Dengue fever in Kinondoni, Dar es Salaam during the 2014 outbreak.
Houses were inspected for mosquito breeding sites and gathered information on Socio-economic Status (SES) and Dengue prevention knowledge.\n\nHigher SES tertile had the most Dengue cases: 53 (55%) followed by medium and lower SES with 33 (34%) and 11 (11%) respectively.
The highest number of mosquito breeding sites was also found in higher SES households.
Kinondoni wards of Manzese, Mwananyamala, Tandale and Mabibo had the highest number of confirmed cases: 18, 13, 13 and 9 respectively.
Each ward has large marketplaces, which may have aided dissemination of transmission to other areas.\n\nThe population remains poorly informed about Dengue transmission: 22% of respondents said Dengue is spread from person to another, 30% did not think mosquitoes spread Dengue and 60% heard about Dengue while in hospital.
Knowledge of bite prevention was poor; Dengue mosquito bites outside of sleeping hours but 84% of Dengue patients said that using bednets would prevent vector bites.\n\nConclusionAffluent households are likely to be reservoirs of Dengue vectors having more breeding sites and Dengue cases.
Mobile phones whose ownership is high across all social classes seem to be a better tool to communicate information about Dengue.
The study established a habitat suitability score, a tool to be used for learning and estimate breeding habitat capacity to be used for vector control before rains begin.\n\nAuthors SummaryDengue fever is a viral infection transmitted by Aedes (Stegomyia) mosquitoes causing a flu-like illness that may develop into severe complications such as Dengue haemorrhagic fever and Dengue shock syndrome if the patient contracts two viral serotypes concurrently.
There is currently no antiviral treatment or vaccines available against Dengue.
Environmental vector control and mosquito bite prevention remain essential to prevent transmission.
Due to globalisation and rapid urban expansion, Dar es Salaam is experiencing regular Dengue outbreaks.
Without adequate vector control and public awareness, it is certain that these will continue to re-occur.\n\nThe study presents factors associated with the outbreak in 2014.
Rich households have more places for mosquitoes to breed with 54% found in these households and the majority of Dengue cases 55% came from higher SES groups that represented a greater proportion of cases than lower and middle socioeconomic groups, combined.
The public was ill-informed about Dengue fever: 84% think bed nets can prevent Dengue, and 60% of the patients only became aware of Dengue while in the hospital with the illness.
Scattered containers especially tyres remain ideal breeding sites.
Frequent sugar feeding behavior by Aedes aegypti in Bamako, Mali makes them ideal candidates for control with attractive toxic sugar baits (ATSB)  BackgroundCurrent tools and strategies are not sufficient to reliably address threats and outbreaks of arboviruses including Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever.
aegypti sugar feeding strategies in Bamako, Mali, to determine if this species can be controlled effectively using attractive toxic sugar baits (ATSB).\n\nMethodology/Principal findingsWe determined the relative attraction of Ae.
aegypti males and females to a variety of sugar sources including flowers, fruits, seedpods, and honeydew in the laboratory and using plant-baited traps in the field.
Next, we observed the rhythm of blood feeding versus sugar feeding activity of Ae.
aegypti in vegetation and in open areas.
Finally, we studied the effectiveness of spraying vegetation with ATSB on Ae.
aegypti in sugar rich (lush vegetation) and in sugar poor (sparse vegetation) urban environments.\n\nMale and female laboratory sugar feeding rates within 24 h, on 8 of 16 plants offered were over 80%.
The survival rates of mosquitoes on several plant sources were nearly as long as that of controls maintained on sucrose solution.
Peak periods of host attraction for blood-feeding and sugar feeding in open areas were nearly identical and occurred shortly after sunrise and around sunset.
In shaded areas, the first sugar-seeking peak occurred between 11:30 and 12:30 while the second was from 16:30 to 17:30.
In a 50-day field trial, ATSB significantly reduced mean numbers of landing / biting female Ae.
aegypti in the two types of vegetation.
At sugar poor sites, the mean pre-treatment catch of 20.51 females on day 14 was reduced 70-fold to 0.29 on day 50.
At sugar rich sites, the mean pre-treatment catch of 32.46 females on day 14 was reduced 10-fold to a mean of 3.20 females on day 50.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceThis is the first study to show how the vector Ae.
aegypti populations rapidly collapsed after ATSB treatment, in both sugar rich and sugar poor environments, is strong evidence that Ae.
aegypti is sugar-feeding frequently.
aegypti mosquitoes depend on natural sugar resources, and a promising new method for vector control, ATSB, can be highly effective in the fight against Aedes-transmitted diseases.\n\nAuthor summaryAedes aegypti are notoriously difficult to control since their ubiquitous man-made and natural breeding sites, in various geographical regions, include almost any receptacle that can hold water.
These diurnal mosquitoes are anthropophilic, a preference that promotes their role as vectors of many arboviruses including Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever.
With the exception of yellow fever, there are no vaccines against any of these arboviruses so that use of personal protective measures and mosquito vector control are the only means of prevention.
Disease burdens in most endemic areas are not sufficiently reduced by various integrated vector management (IVM) strategies, hence there is a need for new control tools to complement the common strategies.
Control by Attractive Toxic Sugar Baits (ATSB) appears to be an ideal candidate for this purpose.\n\nThe results of this study support this proposition.
aegypti in their urban environments in Mali are attracted to and frequently feed on staple diet that includes a variety of flowers, fruits and seed pods.
aegypti is a suitable candidate for control with ATSB.
Moreover, the experiments with ATSB, in sparse vegetation or with competitor plant attractants in rich vegetation, demonstrated that ATSB treatment can cause a drastic reduction of Ae.
aegypti populations.
Combining genetic crosses and pool targeted DNA-seq for untangling genomic variations associated with resistance to multiple insecticides in the dengue vector Aedes aegypti  In addition to combating vector-borne diseases, studying the adaptation of mosquitoes to insecticides provides a remarkable example of evolution-in-action driving the selection of complex phenotypes.
Indeed, most resistant mosquito populations show multi-resistance phenotypes as a consequence of the variety of insecticides employed and of the complexity of selected resistance mechanisms.
Such complexity makes challenging the identification of alleles conferring resistance to specific insecticides and prevents the development of molecular assays to track them in the field.
Here we showed that combining simple genetic crosses with pool targeted DNA-seq can enhance the specificity of resistance alleles detection while maintaining experimental work and sequencing effort at reasonable levels.
A multi-resistant population of the mosquito Aedes aegypti was exposed to three distinct insecticides (deltamethrin, bendiocarb and fenitrothion) and survivors to each insecticide were crossed with a susceptible strain to generate 3 distinct lines.
F2 individuals from each line were then segregated with 2 insecticide doses.
Bioassays supported the improved segregation of resistance alleles between lines.
Hundreds of genes covering all detoxifying enzymes and insecticide targets together with more than 7,000 intergenic regions equally spread over mosquito genome were sequenced from pools of F0 and F2 individuals unexposed or surviving insecticide.
Differential coverage analysis identified 39 detoxification enzymes showing an increased gene copy number in association with resistance.
Combining an allele frequency filtering approach with a Bayesian FST-based genome scan identified multiple genomic regions showing strong selection signatures together with 50 non-synonymous variations associated with resistance.
This study provides a simple and cost-effective approach to improve the segregation of resistant alleles in multi-resistant populations while reducing false positives frequently arising when comparing populations showing divergent genetic backgrounds.
The identification of these insecticide resistance markers paves the way for the design of novel DNA-based resistance tracking assays.\n\nAuthor summaryIn addition to combating vector-borne diseases, understanding how mosquitoes adapt to insecticides provides a remarkable example of evolution-in-action.
However, the variety of insecticides used and the complexity of adaptive mechanisms make it difficult to identify the genetic changes conferring resistance to each insecticide.
Here we combined simple controlled crosses with mass DNA sequencing for enhancing the specificity of resistance gene detection.
A multi-resistant mosquito population was exposed to three distinct insecticides and survivors were crossed with a susceptible strain to generate 3 distinct mosquito lines.
Individuals from the second generation of each line were then segregated based on their resistance to each insecticide.
Bioassays supported the improved segregation of genetic resistance markers between lines.
Hundreds of genes potentially involved in resistance together with thousands non-genic regions equally spread over mosquito genome were sequenced from individuals from each line.
Genomic analyses identified detoxification enzymes showing an increased gene copy number in association with resistance and multiple genomic regions showing strong selection signatures and carrying point mutations associated with resistance.
Such approach improves the specificity of resistance gene detection in field mosquito populations resisting to multiple insecticides and paves the way for the design of novel DNA-based resistance tracking tools.
Estimating relatedness between malaria parasites  1.Understanding the relatedness of individuals within or between populations is a common goal in biology.
Increasingly, relatedness features in genetic epidemiology studies of pathogens.
Only recently have researchers begun to routinely apply relatedness to apicomplexan eukaryotic malaria parasites, and to date have used a range of different approaches on an ad hoc basis.
Here, we systematically compare measures based on identity-by-state and identity-by-descent using a globally diverse data set of malaria parasites, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, and provide marker requirements for estimates based on identity-by-descent.
We formally show that the informativeness of polyallelic markers for relatedness inference is maximised when alleles are equifrequent.
Estimates based on identity-by-state are sensitive to allele frequencies, which vary across populations and by experimental design.
Confidence intervals illuminate inference across studies based on different sets of markers.
These marker requirements, unlike many thus far reported, are immediately applicable to haploid malaria parasites and other haploid eukaryotes.
This is the first attempt to provide rigorous analysis of the reliability of, and requirements for, relatedness inference in malaria genetic epidemiology, and will provide a basis for statistically informed prospective study design and surveillance strategies.
Publicly available transcriptomes provide the opportunity for dual RNA-Seq meta analysis in Plasmodium infection  Dual RNA-Seq is the simultaneous transcriptomic analysis of interacting symbionts, for example, in malaria.
Potential cross-species interactions identified by correlated gene expression might highlight interlinked signaling, metabolic or gene regulatory pathways in addition to physically interacting proteins.
Often, malaria studies address one of the interacting organisms - host or parasite - rendering the other "contamination".
Here we perform a meta-analysis using such studies for cross-species expression analysis.
We screened experiments for gene expression from host and Plasmodium.
Out of 171 studies in Homo sapiens, Macaca mulatta and Mus musculus, we identified 63 potential studies containing host and parasite data.
While 16 studies (1950 samples) explicitly performed dual RNA-Seq, 47 (1398 samples) originally focused on one organism.
We found 915 experimental replicates from 20 blood studies to be suitable for co-expression analysis and used orthologs for meta-analysis across different host-parasite systems.
Centrality metrics from the derived gene expression networks correlated with gene essentiality in the parasites.
We found indications of host immune response to elements of the Plasmodium protein degradation system, an antimalarial drug target.
We identified well-studied immune responses in the host with our co-expression networks as our approach recovers known broad processes interlinked between hosts and parasites in addition to individual host and parasite protein associations.
The set of core interactions represents commonalities between human malaria and its model systems for prioritization in laboratory experiments.
Our approach might also allow insights into the transferability of model systems for different pathways in malaria studies.
ImportanceMalaria still causes about 400,000 deaths a year and is one the most studied infectious diseases.
The disease is studied in mice and monkeys as lab models to derive potential therapeutic intervention in human malaria.
Interactions between Plasmodium spp.
and its hosts are either conserved across different host-parasite systems or idiosyncratic to those systems.
Here we use correlation of gene expression from different RNA-Seq studies to infer common host-parasite interactions across human, mouse and monkey studies.
Secondly, this work might help assess to which extent experiments and knowledge on different pathways can be transferred from models to humans for potential therapy.
Midgut barriers prevent the replication and dissemination of the yellow fever vaccine in Aedes aegypti  BackgroundTo be transmitted to vertebrate hosts via the saliva of their vectors, arthropod-borne viruses have to cross several barriers in the mosquito body, including the midgut infection and escape barriers.
Yellow fever virus (YFV) belongs to the genus Flavivirus, which includes human viruses transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, such as Dengue and Zika viruses.
The live-attenuated YFV-17D vaccine has been used safely and efficiently on a large scale since the end of World War II.
Early studies have shown, using viral titration from salivary glands of infected mosquitoes, that YFV-17D can infect Aedes aegypti midgut, but does not disseminate to other tissues.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsHere, we re-visited this issue using a panel of techniques, such as RT-qPCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence and titration assays.
We showed that YFV-17D replication was not efficient in Aedes aegypti midgut, as compared to the clinical isolate YFV-Dakar.
Viruses that replicated in the midgut failed to disseminate to secondary organs.
When injected into the thorax of mosquitoes, viruses succeeded in replicating into midgut-associated tissues, suggesting that, during natural infection, the block for YFV-17D replication occurs at the basal membrane of the midgut.
Our NGS analysis revealed that YFV-Dakar genome exhibited a greater diversity than the vaccine strain; a trait that may contribute to its ability to infect and disseminate efficiently in Ae.
aegypti.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceThe two barriers associated with Ae.
aegypti midgut prevent YFV-17D replication.
Our study contributes to our basic understanding of vector-pathogen interactions and may also aid in the development of non-transmissible live virus vaccines.\n\nAuthor summaryMost flaviviruses, including yellow fever virus (YFV), are transmitted between hosts by mosquito bites.
The yellow fever vaccine (YFV-17D) is one of the safest and most effective live virus vaccine ever developed.
It is also used as a platform for engineering vaccines against other health-threatening flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, Dengue and Zika viruses.
We studied here the replication and dissemination of YFV-17D in mosquitoes.
Our data showed that YFV-17D replicates poorly in mosquito midgut and is unable to disseminate to secondary organs, as compare to a YFV clinical isolate.
Our study contributes to our basic understanding of the interactions between viruses and their vectors, which is key for conceiving new approaches in inhibiting virus transmission and designing non-transmissible live virus vaccines.

The disease is studied in mice and monkeys as lab models to derive potential therapeutic intervention in human malaria.
Interactions between Plasmodium spp.
and its hosts are either conserved across different host-parasite systems or idiosyncratic to those systems.
Here we use correlation of gene expression from different RNA-Seq studies to infer common host-parasite interactions across human, mouse and monkey studies.
Secondly, this work might help assess to which extent experiments and knowledge on different pathways can be transferred from models to humans for potential therapy.
Emerging arbovirosis (Dengue, Chikungunya, Zika) in the Southeastern Mexico: influence of social and environmental determinants on knowledge and practices.
A mixed method study  BackgroundThe incidence and geographical distribution of arboviruses is constantly increasing.
The epidemiological patterns of the proliferation of viruses and their vectors (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus) are associated with socio-environmental determinants, and are closely related to human habits, especially at the household level.
The aim of this work is to analyze the influence of socio-environmental determinants on the knowledge and practices related to arboviruses and their transmission, among the residents of three communities on the southern border of Mexico.\n\nMethodologyBetween June 2017 and August 2018, our investigation covered a set of 149 households from three communities of Tapachula (Chiapas) and Villahermosa (Tabasco).
We first conducted household surveys about knowledge and practices on arbovirosis.
Then, we carried out direct observations of risk factors for vector proliferation at the domestic level, before and after exposing a part of the population to a cycle of community engagement prevention activities.
Through semi-structured interviews, we also focused on the detection of environmental risk situations for vector breeding at the community level.\n\nKey resultsWe found that most dwellings had an adequate knowledge about the origin and transmission of arboviruses, but only a minority of them also implemented appropriate practices.
Higher education levels were associated with better prevention scores.
The observations made after the cycle of community activities in Chiapas revealed a decrease in the accumulation of unprotected water deposits.
A higher percentage of domestic risk practices were detected in association with significant deficiencies in sanitation and water supply services.
In addition to the educational level, intermediate social determinants (such as water supply and environmental sanitation) influence the persistence of behaviors that are risk factors for the proliferation of arbovirosis.
The achievement of an effective and sustainable vector management is required to address these related aspects.\n\nAuthor summaryDengue, Chikungunya and Zika are arboviral diseases, transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes.
As a result of a continuous increase in the geographical spread and burden of disease, arbovirosis have become a priority issue for global health.\n\nThe proliferation of viruses and their vectors are influenced by a complex interaction of environmental and social determinants.
Thus, the design of effective and sustainable prevention and control measures requires an understanding of all these different aspects.\n\nThe aim of our work is to explore the effects of social and environmental factors on the knowledge and practices related to Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika and their transmission, among the residents of three communities on the southern border of Mexico, currently an endemic area.
Our study draws on the application of a program combining the implementation of new technologies for vector management with a participatory and holistic multidisciplinary approach.\n\nBetween June 2017 and August 2018, we used different surveys and methodological approaches to explore knowledge and practices on arbovirosis, as well as to identify risk factors for vector proliferation.
We found that intermediate social determinants (such as occasional water supply and infrequent waste collections) influence the persistence of behaviors that are risk factors for the proliferation of arbovirosis.\n\nPublic health interventions for arbovirosis prevention must be accompanied by intersectoral work that includes the improvement of these related aspects, according to the multifactorial etiology of arboviruses.

HIV-MALARIA CO-INFECTION AND ITS DETERMINANTS AMONG PATIENTS ATTENDING ANTIRETROVIRAL TREATMENT CLINIC IN ZARIA, NORTH-WESTERN NIGERIA  IntroductionMalaria and HIV are two important global public health problems.
Together, they cause more than two million deaths each year.
In sub-Saharan Africa alone, more than 29 million people are living with HIV/AIDS and about 70% of population is at risk to malaria infection.
Nigeria accounts for about a quarter of the global malaria cases and tenth of the global HIV cases.
Recent theories suggested possibilities of high occurrence of HIV-malaria co-infection wherever there is geographical overlap of the two diseases.
We therefore conducted this study to determine the prevalence of HIV-malaria co-infection and its determinants in a malaria endemic setting.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study.
Two hundred and sixty-two clients attending antiretroviral treatment (ART) clinic in Zaria, Kaduna State were enrolled between February and April 2018 using systematic sampling technique.
Questionnaires were administered to collect information on respondents personal characteristics as well as their knowledge, perception and practices on malaria prevention.
Venous blood samples were collected and analyzed for malaria parasite, viral load, CD4, and FBC using Giemsa stained light microscopy, COBAS TaqMan equipment, BD FACS flow cytometer, and Sysmex haematology analyser respectively.
Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed, predictors of HIV-malaria co-infection were ascertained at multivariate analysis.\n\nResultsMedian age of the respondents was 33 years, 52% were females, 65% were married, 65% were employed, 57% lived in urban residence, and 34% had tertiary education.
The prevalence of malaria co-infection among HIV patients was found to be 22.9%.
Significant risk factors for the co-infection were high HIV viral load (aOR= 3.30, C.I = 1.15-9.45), being co-infected with TB (aOR= 5.60, C.I = 1.34-23.33), poor knowledge of malaria infection (aOR= 3.12, C.I = 1.27-7.72) and poor practice of malaria prevention (aOR= 13.30, C.I = 4.88-36.23).\n\nConclusionThe level of occurrence of malaria among HIV infected patients in this setting calls for attention.
We recommended that health education on malaria should be a priority in malaria control programme; the programmes for control of HIV, malaria and TB should collaborate to ensure integrated service delivery and that people living with HIV/AIDS should be given special consideration for malaria prevention.
Host porphobilinogen deaminase deficiency confers malaria resistance in  Plasmodium chabaudi  but not in  Plasmodium falciparum  or  Plasmodium berghei  during intraerythrocytic growth  An important component in host resistance to malaria infection are inherited mutations that give rise to abnormalities and deficiencies in erythrocyte proteins and enzymes.
Understanding how such mutations confer protection against the disease may be useful for developing new treatment strategies.
A mouse ENU-induced mutagenesis screen for novel malaria resistance-conferring mutations identified a novel nonsense mutation in the gene encoding porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) in mice, denoted here as PbgdMRI58155.
Heterozygote PbgdMRI58155 mice exhibited approximately 50% reduction in cellular PBGD activity in both mature erythrocytes and reticulocytes, although enzyme activity was approximately 10 times higher in reticulocytes than erythrocytes.
When challenged with blood-stage P. chabaudi, which preferentially infects erythrocytes, heterozygote mice showed a modest but significant resistance to infection, including reduced parasite growth.
A series of assays conducted to investigate the mechanism of resistance indicated that mutant erythrocyte invasion by P. chabaudi was normal, but that following intraerythrocytic establishment a significantly greater proportions of parasites died and therefore affected their ability to propagate.
The Plasmodium resistance phenotype was not recapitulated in Pbgd-deficient mice infected with P. berghei, which prefers reticulocytes, or when P. falciparum was cultured in erythrocytes from patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), which had modest (20-50%) reduced levels of PBGD.
The Plasmodium resistance phenotype was not recapitulated in Pbgd-deficient mice infected with P. berghei, which prefers reticulocytes, or when P. falciparum was cultured in erythrocytes from patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), which had modest (20-50%) reduced levels of PBGD.
Furthermore, the growth of Pbgd-null P. falciparum and Pbgd-null P. berghei parasites, which grew at the same rate as their wild-type counterparts in normal cells, were not affected by the PBGD-deficient background of the AIP erythrocytes or Pbgd-deficient mice.
Furthermore, the growth of Pbgd-null P. falciparum and Pbgd-null P. berghei parasites, which grew at the same rate as their wild-type counterparts in normal cells, were not affected by the PBGD-deficient background of the AIP erythrocytes or Pbgd-deficient mice.

Our results confirm the dispensability of parasite PBGD for P. berghei infection and intraerythrocytic growth of P. falciparum, but for the first time identify a requirement for host erythrocyte PBGD by P. chabaudi during in vivo blood stage infection.

Our results confirm the dispensability of parasite PBGD for P. berghei infection and intraerythrocytic growth of P. falciparum, but for the first time identify a requirement for host erythrocyte PBGD by P. chabaudi during in vivo blood stage infection.
IMPORTANCEThe causative agent of malaria, Plasmodium, adopts a parasitic lifestyle during erythrocyte infection, and as such relies on host cell factors for its survival and growth.
Host-encoded mutations that alter the availability of these factors confer disease resistance, including several well-known genetic erythrocyte abnormalities that have arisen due to the historical evolutionary pressure of malaria.
This study identified in mice a novel malaria resistance-conferring host mutation in the heme biosynthesis enzyme, porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), and compared the relative requirements by Plasmodium for the host versus parasite-encoded forms of PBGD in both in vivo and in vitro settings.
The findings demonstrated that parasite PBGD was dispensable, but that the host enzyme was important specifically during in vivo infection by P. chabaudi, and collectively suggest that Plasmodium requires a certain threshold of the enzyme to sustain its intraerythrocytic growth.
Plasmodium may therefore be vulnerable to other interventions that limit host PBGD activity.
Rapid and iterative genome editing in the zoonotic malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi: New tools for P. vivax research  Tackling relapsing Plasmodium vivax and zoonotic Plasmodium knowlesi infections is critical to reducing malaria incidence and mortality worldwide.
Understanding the biology of these important and related parasites was previously constrained by the lack of robust molecular and genetic approaches.
Here, we establish CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in a culture-adapted P. knowlesi strain and define parameters for optimal homology-driven repair.
We establish a scalable protocol for the production of repair templates by PCR and demonstrate the flexibility of the system by tagging proteins with distinct cellular localisations.
Using iterative rounds of genome-editing we generate a transgenic line expressing P. vivax Duffy binding protein (PvDBP), a lead vaccine candidate.
We demonstrate that PvDBP plays no role in reticulocyte restriction but can alter the macaque/human host cell tropism of P. knowlesi.
Critically, antibodies raised against the P. vivax antigen potently inhibit proliferation of this strain, providing an invaluable tool to support vaccine development.
A high throughput multi-locus insecticide resistance marker panel for tracking resistance emergence and spread in Anopheles gambiae  The spread of resistance to insecticides in the mosquito vectors of diseases such as malaria and dengue poses a threat to the effectiveness of control programmes, which rely largely on insecticide-based interventions.
Monitoring the resistance status of mosquito populations is therefore essential, but obtaining direct phenotypic measurements of resistance is laborious and error-prone.
In contrast, high-throughput genotyping offers the prospect of quick and repeatable estimates of resistance, while also allowing the genotypic markers of resistance to be tracked and studied.
We developed a panel of 28 known or putative markers of resistance in the major malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, which we use to test the association of these markers with resistance and to study their geographic distribution.
We screened resistance-phenotyped An.
gambiae from populations from a wide swathe of Sub-Saharan Africa (Burkina Faso, Ghana, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Kenya), and found evidence of resistance association for four mutations, including a novel mutation in the detoxification gene Gste2 (Gste2-119V).
We also identified a gene duplication in Gste2 which combines a resistance-associated mutant form of the gene with its wild-type counterpart, potentially alleviating the costs of resistance.
Finally, we describe the distribution of the multiple evolutionary origins of kdr resistance, finding unprecedented levels of diversity in the DRC.
This panel represents the first step towards developing a quantitative predictive genotypic model of insecticide resistance that can be used to screen An.
gambiae populations and predict resistance status.
Aedes aegypti (Aag2)-derived clonal mosquito cell lines reveal the impact of pre-existing persistent infection with the insect-specific bunyavirus Phasi Charoen-like virus on arbovirus replication  BackgroundAedes aegypti is a vector mosquito of major public health importance, transmitting arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) such as chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever and Zika viruses.
Wild mosquito populations are persistently infected at high prevalence with insect-specific viruses that do not replicate in vertebrate hosts.
In experimental settings, acute infections with insect-specific viruses have been shown to modulate arbovirus infection and transmission in Ae.
aegypti and other vector mosquitoes.
However, the impact of persistent insect-specific virus infections that more closely mimic the situation in nature has not been investigated extensively.
Cell lines are useful models for studying virus-host interactions, however the available Ae.
aegypti cell lines are poorly defined and heterogenous cultures.\n\nMethodology/Principle FindingsWe generated single cell-derived clonal cell lines from the commonly used Ae.
aegypti cell line Aag2.
Two of the fourteen Aag2-derived clonal cell lines generated harboured markedly and consistently reduced levels of the insect-specific bunyavirus Phasi Charoen-like virus (PCLV) known to persistently infect Aag2 cells.
In contrast to studies with acute insect-specific virus infections in cell culture and in vivo, we found that pre-existing persistent PCLV infection had no major impact on the replication of the flaviviruses dengue virus and Zika virus, the alphavirus Sindbis virus, or the rhabdovirus vesicular stomatitis virus.
We also performed a detailed characterisation of the morphology, transfection efficiency and immune status of our Aag2-derived clonal cell lines, and have made a clone that we term Aag2-AF5 available to the research community as a well-defined cell culture model for arbovirus-vector interaction studies.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceOur findings highlight the need for further in vivo studies that more closely recapitulate natural arbovirus transmission settings in which arboviruses encounter mosquitoes harbouring persistent rather than acute insect-specific virus infections.
Furthermore, we provide the well-characterised Aag2-derived clonal cell line as a valuable resource to the arbovirus research community.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMosquito-borne viruses usually only infect humans through the bite of a mosquito that carries the virus.
Viruses transmitted by the  yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti, including dengue virus, Zika virus, yellow fever virus and chikungunya virus, are causing an ever-increasing number of human disease cases globally.
Mosquito-borne viruses have to infect and replicate inside the mosquito before they are transmitted to humans, and the presence of other infectious agents can change the efficiency of virus transmission.
Mosquitoes are known to be infected with  insect-specific viruses that only infect mosquitoes and cannot cause human disease.
We have shown here that in laboratory cell cultures derived from the Aedes aegypti mosquito, pre-existing infection with an insect-specific virus called Phasi Charoen-like virus does not affect the infection and growth of the mosquito-borne viruses dengue virus, Zika virus, Sindbis virus or vesicular stomatitis virus.
Compared to previous research, our research is more reflective of conditions that mosquito-borne viruses encounter in nature, and our results provide important new insights into whether and how insect-specific viruses affect mosquito-borne virus transmission.
Ultimately, this information could inform ongoing research into whether insect-specific viruses could be used to prevent the transmission of mosquito-borne viruses to reduce global disease burdens.
Serostatus Testing & Dengue Vaccine Cost-Benefit Thresholds  The World Health Organisation currently recommends pre-screening for past infection prior to administration of the only licensed dengue vaccine, CYD-TDV.
When testing is cheap enough, those trends outweigh additional screening costs and make test-then-vaccinate strategies net-beneficial in many settings.\n\nWe derived these results using a general approach for determining price thresholds for testing and vaccination, as well as indicating optimal start and end ages of routine test-then-vaccinate programs.
We found trends showing test-then-vaccinate strategies are generally more beneficial starting at younger ages, and that in some settings multiple years of testing can be more beneficial than only testing once, despite increased investment in testing.
Modulated Zika virus NS1 conjugate offers advantages for accurate detection of Zika virus specific antibody in double antigen binding and Ig capture enzyme immunoassays  The accurate diagnosis and seroprevalence investigations of Zika virus (ZKV) infections remain complex due to cross reactivity with other flaviviruses.
Two assay formats, both using labelled Zika virus NS1 antigen as a revealing agent (a double antigen binding assay, DABA, and an immunoglobulin Ig capture assay, IgG capture) were initially developed and compared with the indirect EuroimmunZ assay for the detection of anti-Zika antibody.
Of 147 pre-Zika period serum samples, 39 (27%) were reactive in the EuroimmunZ or the DABA assays, 28 sera concordantly so.
Such false reactivity was influenced by the serotype of Dengue virus (DV) to which individuals had been exposed to.
Thus, of sera from patients undergoing secondary Dengue virus infection of known serotype, 91%, 45% and 28% of Dengue virus serotype 2, 3 and 4 respectively were reactive in one or more of the three assays.
A novel method of quenching false sero-reactivity was therefore developed for the DABA and IgG capture assays.
Initial addition of a single homologous Dengue virus serotype 3 NS1Ag quench significantly ablated false reactivities in the pre-Zika period sera.
An equipotent quadrivalent quench comprising homologous Dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 NS1Ag was shown to be optimum yet retained sensitivity for the detection of specific anti-Zika antibody.
Comparing DABA and IgG capture assays using quenched and unquenched conjugates in comparison with EuroimmunZ early in the course of PCR-confirmed infection indicated that a significant component of the apparent early anti-ZIKA antibody response is likely to be due to a Zika virus-driven anamnestic anti-Dengue virus response.
The increased specificity provided by homologous antigen quenching is likely to provide a significant improvement in sero-diagnostics and to be of clinical value.
Importance of erythrocyte deformability for the alignment of malaria parasite upon invasion  Invasion of erythrocytes by merozoites is an essential step for the survival and progression of malaria parasites.
In order to invade red blood cells (RBCs), parasites have to adhere with their apex to the RBC membrane.
Since a random adhesion contact between the parasite and membrane would be too inefficient, it has been hypothesized that merozoites are able to actively re-orient toward apex-membrane alignment.
This is supported by several experimental observations which show that merozoites frequently induce considerable membrane deformations before the invasion process.
Even though a positive correlation between RBC membrane deformation and successful invasion is established, the role of RBC mechanics and its deformation in the alignment process remains elusive.
Using a mechanically realistic model of a deformable RBC, we investigate numerically the importance of RBC deformability for merozoite alignment.
Adhesion between the parasite and RBC membrane is modeled by an attractive potential which might be inhomogeneous, mimicking possible adhesion gradients at the surface of a parasite.
Our results show that RBC membrane deformations are crucial for successful merozoite alignment, and require strengths comparable to adhesion forces measured experimentally.
Adhesion gradients along the parasite body further improve its alignment.
Finally, an increased membrane rigidity is found to result in poor merozoite alignment, which can be a possible reason for the reduction in the invasion of RBCs in several blood diseases associated with membrane stiffening.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEPlasmodium parasites invade erythrocytes during the progression of malaria.
To start invasion, the parasites have to re-orient themselves such that their apex establishes a direct contact with erythrocyte membrane.
The re-orientation (or alignment) process is often associated with strong membrane deformations, which are believed to be induced by the parasite and are positively correlated with its alignment.
We employ a mechanically realistic erythrocyte model to investigate the interplay of membrane deformations and merozoite alignment during parasite adhesion to an erythrocyte.
Our model clearly demonstrates that erythrocyte membrane deformations are a key component of successful parasite alignment, since the re-orientation of parasites at rigidified membranes is generally poor.
Therefore, our results suggest a possible mechanism for the reduction in erythrocyte invasion in several blood diseases associated with membrane stiffening.
Primary infection with dengue or Zika virus does not affect the severity of heterologous secondary infection in macaques.
Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are genetically and antigenically related flaviviruses that now co-circulate in much of the tropical and subtropical world.
The rapid emergence of ZIKV in the Americas in 2015 and 2016, and its recent associations with Guillain-Barre syndrome, birth defects, and fetal loss have led to the hypothesis that DENV infection induces cross-reactive antibodies that influence the severity of secondary ZIKV infections.
It has also been proposed that pre-existing ZIKV immunity could affect DENV pathogenesis.
We examined outcomes of secondary ZIKV infections in three rhesus and fifteen cynomolgus macaques, as well as secondary DENV-2 infections in three additional rhesus macaques up to a year post-primary ZIKV infection.
Although cross-binding antibodies were detected prior to secondary infection for all animals and cross-neutralizing antibodies were detected for some animals, previous DENV or ZIKV infection had no apparent effect on the clinical course of heterotypic secondary infections in these animals.
All animals had asymptomatic infections and, when compared to controls, did not have significantly perturbed hematological parameters.
Rhesus macaques infected with DENV-2 approximately one year after primary ZIKV infection had higher vRNA loads in plasma when compared with serum vRNA loads from ZIKV-naive animals infected with DENV-2, but a differential effect of sample type could not be ruled out.
In cynomolgus macaques, the serotype of primary DENV infection did not affect the outcome of secondary ZIKV infection.\n\nAuthor summaryPre-existing immunity to one of the four DENV serotypes is known to increase the risk of severe disease upon secondary infection with a different serotype.
Data from in vitro experiments and murine models suggests that pre-existing immunity to one virus could either enhance or protect against infection with the other.
These somewhat contradictory findings highlight the need for immune competent animal models for understanding the role of cross-reactive antibodies in flavivirus pathogenesis.
We examined secondary ZIKV or DENV infections in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques that had previously been infected with the other virus.
We assessed the outcomes of secondary ZIKV or DENV infections by quantifying vRNA loads, clinical and laboratory parameters, body temperature, and weight for each cohort of animals and compared them with control animals.
These comparisons demonstrated that within a year of primary infection, secondary infections with either ZIKV or DENV were similar to primary infections and were not associated with enhancement or reduction in severity of disease based on the outcomes that we assessed.
Multiplex serologic testing within a cross-sectional lymphatic filariasis sentinel site survey in coastal Kenya reveals community-level differences in IgG antibody responses to parasitic diseases and vaccines  Accurate, cost-effective measurement of the burden of co-endemic infections would enable public health managers to identify opportunities for implementation of integrated control programs.
Dried blood spots (DBS) collected during a cross-sectional lymphatic filariasis sentinel site survey in the Kenyan coastal counties of Lamu, Tana River, Kilifi, Kwale, and Taita-Taveta were used for the integrated detection of serologic IgG antibodies against antigens from several parasitic infections (Wuchereria bancrofti, Schistosoma mansoni, Plasmodium spp, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Strongyloides stercoralis) as well as markers for immunity to vaccine-preventable diseases (measles, diphtheria, and tetanus) on a multiplex bead assay (MBA) platform.
High heterogeneity was observed in antibody responses by pathogen and antigen across the sentinel sites.
Antibody seroprevalence against Wb123, Bm14, and Bm33 recombinant filarial antigens were generally higher in Ndau Island (p<0.0001), which also had the highest prevalence of filarial antigenemia compared to other communities.
Antibody responses to the Plasmodium species antigens CSP and MSP-119 were higher in Kilifi and Kwale counties, with Jaribuni community showing higher overall mean seroprevalence (p<0.0001).
Kimorigo community in Taita-Taveta County was the only area where antibody responses against Schistosoma mansoni Sm25 recombinant antigen were detected.
Seroprevalence rates to Strongyloides antigen NIE ranged between 3% and 26%, and there was high heterogeneity in immune responses against an Ascaris antigen among the study communities.
Seroprotection to tetanus was lower in all 3 communities in Kwale County compared to the rest of the communities.
This study has demonstrated that the MBA platform holds promise for rapid integrated monitoring of trends of infections of public health importance in endemic areas, and assessing the effectiveness of control and elimination programs.\n\nAuthor SummaryEstablishment of successful private-public partnerships in the recent past has led to an increase in resources available for control and elimination of malaria and Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs).
Since development of antibody responses in a host depend on exposure to an infectious agent, assessment of such serologic markers provides a sensitive way to measure differences between populations in pathogen exposure.
Our study applied a state-of-the-art multiplex bead assay platform to perform integrated measurement of antibody responses to multiple parasitic diseases and immunizing antigens for vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) in ten lymphatic filariasis sentinel sites across the Kenyan coastal region.
A community-level analysis of age-specific and overall mean seroprevalence fit using a flexible model ensemble provided an improved understanding about the distributions of the various parasitic infections and seroprotection to VPDs.
This study provides an important proof of concept for how we could dramatically increase the value of existing surveillance activities using small volumes of blood collected on filter paper and analyzed using a single multiplex laboratory assay and novel data analysis techniques.
Comparison of National Level Spatial and Spatio-temporal Models of Malaria  Geospatial statistical models play an important role in malaria control and prevention; they are widely used to produce malaria risk maps, which are essential to guide efficient resource allocation for intervention.
To our knowledge, methods such as splines and decision trees ensemble methods have not been compared relative to their predictive skill for country level malaria prevalence mapping.
Moreover, as more countries now have multiple datasets collected throughout the past decade, it is critical to evaluate if the inclusion of past datasets and the use of spatio-temporal models improve the prediction accuracy of present spatial distribution of malaria.
Here we compare the prediction accuracy of five models under spatial and spatio-temporal settings in five African countries.
The five models are stepwise logistic regression, generalized additive model (GAM), gradient boosted trees (GBM), Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) and the BGM.
There is not a single best model to predict malaria prevalence on a national scale.
In general, BGM, GAM and BART models performed well, with BGM being the most consistent.
The inclusion of past data is not always beneficial: the predictive performance of GAM and GBM increased under spatio-temporal setting, but BGMs performance decreased in most of the countries.
An accurate depiction of malaria risk is important and statistical assumptions that are suitable for a country does not always fit other countries and a wide range of models and settings should be used.
It ensures that we find the best modeling approach possible and can provide additional insight to the spatial distribution of malaria risk.\n\nAuthor summaryMalaria is still affecting hundreds of millions of people every year, and killing hundreds of thousands.
As the majority of malaria intervention and control policies are developed at the national level, accurate spatial prediction of malaria risk is important.
Here we compare the predictive performance of five models in five countries, with and without dataset from multiple surveys, to provide empirical evidence on whether there is a single best model for national level malaria prediction, and whether inclusion of past dataset may be beneficial in predicting current distribution of malaria risk.
We find that models performances vary from country to country and there is no single best model.
Although Bayesian geostatistical model is widely and commonly used in the literatures, its performance is not necessarily superior to other simpler-to-fit methods such as general additive model (splines) and Bayesian additive regression tree.
Plasmodium secretion induces hepatocyte lysosome exocytosis and promotes parasite entry  The invasion of a suitable host hepatocyte by Plasmodium sporozoites is an essential step in malaria infection.
We demonstrate that in infected hepatocytes, lysosomes are redistributed away from the nucleus, and surface exposure of lysosomal-associated membrane protein (LAMP1) is increased.
Lysosome exocytosis in infected cells occurs independently of sporozoite traversal.
Instead, a sporozoite-secreted factor is sufficient for the process.
Knockdown of the SNARE proteins involved in lysosome-plasma membrane fusion reduces lysosome exocytosis and Plasmodium infection.
In contrast, promoting fusion between the lysosome and plasma membrane dramatically increases infection.
Our work demonstrates new parallels between Plasmodium sporozoite entry of hepatocytes and infection by the excavate pathogen, Trypanosoma cruzi and raises the question of whether convergent evolution has shaped host cell invasion by divergent pathogens.
Powerful solution for experimental cerebral malaria treatment: artesunate and tetramethylpyrazine  BackgroundCerebral malaria (CM) is a kind of serious neurological complication caused by the acute Plasmodium falciparum infection.
About 300000 patients including children under 5 years old died from this disease every year.
Even intravenous artesunate (Art) is employed as the most effictive drug in the treatment of CM, high incidence of death and neurological sequelae are still inevitable.
Therefore, we assessed the combination of Art and tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), to treat experimental CM (ECM) in C57BL/6 mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA).
A non-biased whole brain quantitative proteomic analysis was also conducted to get some insight of the mechanism of the combinational treatment.\n\nResultsTreatment of (ECM)-C57BL/6 mice with the combination of Art and TMP increased the survival, improved clinical signs and prevented neurological manifestations.
These effects were related to reduction of parasitised red blood cells (pRBC) adhesion, sequestration, maintaining brain microvascular integrity, increasing nerve growth factor, neurotrophin levels, and alleviating hippocampal neuronal damage and astrocyte activation.
The pharmacological effects of Art-TMP combination therapy were analyzed by ECM mice brain proteomic function enrichment.
Based on an isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) fold-change of 1.2 (P-value < 0.05), 217 down-regulated and 177 up-regulated proteins were identified, presenting a significantly altered proteome profile of the combined Art and TMP group as compared to the group treated with Art or TMP alone.
These results suggested that the Art-TMP combination could be used as a powerful solution for CM and its neurologic damage.\n\nConclusionsAn effictive therapy for CM with low mortality rate and protect against ECM-induced neurocognitive impairment has been proposed through the combination of Art and TMP, which can provide an effective adjuvant treatment in the clinic.
iTRAQ proteomics provide a resource for further mechanistic studies to examine the synergistic effects of Art and TMP and their potential to serve as an adjunctive treatment method and intervention targets.\n\nAuthor SummaryCerebral malaria (CM) is the most serious neurological complication caused by Plasmodium falciparum infection.
Even after antimalarial treatment, severe neurological sequelae still exist.
We used tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), the main ingredient of the traditional Chinese medicine Chuanxiong, and artesunate (Art) as a combination of drugs.
We found that Art-TMP combination could improve the clinical symptoms of CM and protect the nervous system.
At the same time, proteomics was used to analyze the protective mechanism of Art-TMP combination administration on ECM mice.
This study suggests that the combination of Art and TMP may be used as an adjuvant therapy for clinical CM and iTRAQ proteomics provides resources for further study of Art-TMP combination and provides potential prognostic biomarkers for this therapeutic intervention.
Matryoshka RNA virus 1: a novel RNA virus associated with Plasmodium parasites in human malaria  Parasites of the genus Plasmodium cause human malaria.
We investigated the Plasmodium virome by performing a meta-transcriptomic analysis of blood samples from malaria patients infected with P. vivax, P. falciparum or P. knowlesi.

We investigated the Plasmodium virome by performing a meta-transcriptomic analysis of blood samples from malaria patients infected with P. vivax, P. falciparum or P. knowlesi.
This revealed a novel bi-segmented narna-like RNA virus restricted to P. vivax and named Matryoshka RNA virus 1 (MaRNAV-1) to reflect its \"Russian doll\" nature: a virus, infecting a parasite, infecting an animal.
MaRNAV-1 was abundant in geographically diverse P. vivax from humans and mosquitoes.
Notably, a related virus (MaRNAV-2) was identified in Australian birds infected with a Leucocytozoon - eukaryotic parasites that group with Plasmodium in the Apicomplexa subclass hematozoa.
As well as broadening our understanding of the eukaryotic virosphere, the restriction to P. vivax may help understand P. vivax-specific biology in humans and mosquitoes.

DEN-IM: Dengue Virus identification from shotgun and targeted metagenomics  Dengue virus (DENV) represents a public health and economic burden in affected countries.
The availability of genomic data is key to understand viral evolution and dynamics, supporting improved control strategies.
Currently, the use of High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) technologies, which can be applied both directly to patient samples (shotgun metagenomics) and to PCR amplified viral sequences (targeted metagenomics), is the most informative approach to monitor the viral dissemination and genetic diversity.\n\nDespite many advantages, these technologies require bioinformatics expertise and appropriate infrastructure for the analysis and interpretation of the resulting data.
In addition, the many software solutions available can hamper reproducibility and comparison of results.\n\nHere we present DEN-IM, a one-stop, user-friendly, containerised and reproducible workflow for the analysis of DENV sequencing data, both from shotgun and targeted metagenomics approaches.
It is able to infer DENV coding sequence (CDS), identify serotype and genotype, and generate a phylogenetic tree.
It can easily be run on any UNIX-like system, from local machines to high-performance computing clusters, performing a comprehensive analysis without the requirement of extensive bioinformatics expertise.\n\nUsing DEN-IM, we successfully analysed two DENV datasets.
The first comprised 25 shotgun metagenomic sequencing samples of varying serotype and genotype, including a spiked sample containing the existing four serotypes.
The second dataset consisted of 106 targeted metagenomics samples of DENV 3 genotype III where DEN-IM allowed detection of the intra-genotype diversity.\n\nThe DEN-IM workflow, parameters and execution configuration files, and documentation are freely available at https://github.com/B-UMMI/DEN-IM.
Hierarchical transcriptional control regulates Plasmodium falciparum sexual differentiation  Malaria pathogenesis relies on sexual gametocyte forms of the malaria parasite to be transmitted between the infected human and the mosquito host but the molecular mechanisms controlling gametocytogenesis remains poorly understood.
Here we provide a high-resolution transcriptome of Plasmodium falciparum as it commits to and develops through gametocytogenesis.
The gametocyte-associated transcriptome is significantly different from that of the asexual parasites, with dynamic gene expression shifts characterizing early, intermediate and late-stage gametocyte development and results in differential timing for sex-specific transcripts.
The striking transcriptional dynamics suggest strict transcriptional control during gametocytogenesis in P. falciparum, which we propose is mediated by putative regulators including epigenetic mechanisms (driving active repression of proliferation-associated processes) and a cascade-like expression of ApiAP2 transcription factors.
The gametocyte transcriptome serves as the blueprint for sexual differentiation and will be a rich resource for future functional studies on this critical stage of Plasmodium development, as the intraerythrocytic transcriptome has been for our understanding of the asexual cycle.
Design and assessment of TRAP-CSP fusion antigens as effective malaria vaccines  The circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (TRAP) are major targets for pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine development.
However, the most advanced CSP-based vaccine RTS,S provides only partial protection, highlighting the need for innovative approaches for vaccine design and development.
Here we design and characterize TRAP-CSP fusion antigens, and evaluate their immunogenicity and protection against malaria infection.
TRAP N-terminal folded domains were fused to CSP C-terminal fragments consisting of the C-terminal TSR domain with or without the intervening repeat region.
Homogenous, monomeric and properly folded fusion proteins were purified from mammalian transfectants.
Notably, fusion improved expression of chimeras relative to the TRAP or CSP components alone.
Immunization of BALB/c mice with the P. berghei TRAP-CSP fusion antigens formulated in AddaVax adjuvant elicited antigen-specific antibody responses.
Remarkably, fusion antigens containing the CSP repeat region conferred complete sterile protection against P. berghei sporozoite challenge, and furthermore, mice that survived the challenge were completely protected from re-challenge 16 weeks after the first challenge.
In contrast, fusion antigens lacking the CSP repeat region were less effective, indicating that the CSP repeat region provided enhanced protection, which correlated with higher antibody titers elicited by fusion antigens containing the CSP repeat region.
In addition, we demonstrated that N-linked glycans had no significant effect on antibody elicitation or protection.
Our results show that TRAP-CSP fusion antigens could be highly effective vaccine candidates.
Our approach provides a platform for designing multi-antigen/multi-stage fusion antigens as next generation more effective malaria vaccines.
New Genotype Emergence of DENV are Constrained by the Double Host Selection, Reducing the Probability of Alternative Serotype Emergence  Since their discovery and sequencing 40 years ago, the DENV genotypes have shown an extreme coherence regarding the serotype class they code for.
Considering the RNA virus mutation rate, we used Timed Markov Model to explore the transmission possibilities of mutated viruses and the statistical eventualities of new serotype emergence.
We find that around 1 000 years are required for a new serotype to emerge, in line with phylogenetic analysis of the Dengue serotypes.
Our work provides a mechanistic explanation of the strictness and low probability of a new Dengue virus serotype occurrence.\n\nAuthor summaryRecent Dengue virus global spread has drawn the attention of the Public Health Policy makers in developing countries and developed countries as well.
The infection gravity and the hemorrhagic dengue syndromes have been related with the absence or presence of previous DENV immunity.
Therefore, the emergence of a new DENV serotype and its spread constitute a matter of concern.
Here, we constructed a mathematical model to determine the probability of such event, as well as de-entangle the mechanistic reasons behind the low serotype emergence factor of the DENV.
The effects of dyslipidaemia and cholesterol modulation on erythrocyte susceptibility to malaria parasite infection  Malaria disease commences when blood-stage parasites, called merozoites, invade human red blood cells (RBCs).
Whilst the process of invasion is traditionally seen as being entirely merozoite-driven, emerging data suggests RBC biophysical properties markedly influence invasion.
Cholesterol is a major determinant of cell membrane biophysical properties.
We set out to assess whether cholesterol content in the RBC membrane affects susceptibility to merozoite invasion.
Here we demonstrate that RBC bending modulus (a measure of deformability) is markedly affected by artificial modulation of cholesterol content and negatively correlated with merozoite invasion efficiency.
Contextualising this observation, we tested a mouse model of hypercholesterolemia and human clinical samples from patients with a range of serum cholesterol concentrations for parasite susceptibility.
Hypercholesterolaemia in both human and murine subjects had little effect merozoite invasion efficiency.
Furthermore, on testing, RBC cholesterol content in both murine and human hypercholesterolaemia settings was found to be unchanged from normal controls.
Serum cholesterol is, therefore, unlikely to impact on RBC susceptibility to merozoite entry.
Our work, however, suggests that native polymorphisms that affect RBC membrane lipid composition would be expected to affect parasite entry.
This supports investigation of RBC biophysical properties in endemic settings, which may yet identify naturally protective lipid-related polymorphisms.
Modelling the population dynamics of Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes in humans during malaria infection  Every year over two hundred million people are infected with the malaria parasite.
Renewed efforts to eliminate malaria has highlighted the potential to interrupt transmission from humans to mosquitoes which is mediated through the gametocytes.
Here we study the population dynamics of Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes in human hosts by establishing a framework which incorporates improved measurements of parasitaemia in humans, a novel mathematical model of gametocyte dynamics, and model validation using a Bayesian hierarchical inference method.
We found that the novel mathematical model provides an excellent fit to the available clinical data from 17 volunteers infected with P. falciparum, and reliably predicts observed gametocyte levels.
We estimated the P. falciparums sexual commitment rate and gametocyte sequestration time in humans to be 0.54% (95% credible interval: 0.30-1.00) per life cycle and 8.39 (6.54-10.59) days respectively.
Furthermore, we used the data-calibrated model to predict the effects of those gametocyte dynamics parameters on human-to-mosquito transmissibility, providing a method to link within-human host kinetics of malaria infection to epidemiological-scale infection and transmission patterns.
Spatial and epidemiologic features of dengue in Sabah, Malaysia  In South East Asia, dengue epidemics have increased in size and geographical distribution in recent years.
Most studies investigating dengue transmission and control have had an urban focus, while less consideration is currently given to rural settings, or where urban and rural areas overlap.
We examined the spatiotemporal distribution and epidemiological characteristics of reported dengue cases in the predominantly rural state of Sabah, in Malaysian Borneo - an area where sylvatic and urban circulation of pathogens are known to intersect.
We found that annual dengue incidence rates were spatially variable over the 7-year study period from 2010-2016 (state-wide mean annual incidence of 21 cases/100,000 people; range 5-42/100,000), but were highest in rural localities in the western districts of the state (Kuala Penyu, Nabawan, Tenom and Kota Marudu).
The eastern districts exhibited lower overall dengue rates; however, we noted a concentration of severe (haemorrhagic) dengue cases (44%) in Sandakan and Tawau districts.
Dengue incidence was slightly higher for males than females, and was significantly higher for both genders aged between 10 and 29 years (24/100,000; p=0.029).
The largest ever recorded outbreaks occurred during 2015-2016, with the vector Aedes albopictus found to be most prevalent in both urban and rural households (House Index of 64%), compared with Ae.
Aegypti (15%).
These findings suggest that dengue outbreaks in Sabah are driven by the sporadic expansion of dengue virus in both urban and rural settings.
Further studies to better understand the drivers of dengue in Sabah may aid dengue control efforts in Malaysia, and more broadly in South East Asia.\n\nAuthor summaryIn order to combat the rising regional incidence of dengue in South East Asia, the drivers of transmission must be better characterised across different environmental settings.
We conducted the first retrospective analysis of dengue epidemiology in the predominantly rural state of Sabah, Malaysia, where both urban and sylvatic transmission cycles exist.
Human notification data over a 7-year period were reviewed and spatiotemporal and demographic risk factors identified.
We found: O_LIUrban habitats and population density are not the only determinants mediating the spread of epidemic dengue in Sabah.
Case from both urban and rural localities contributed equally to dengue outbreaks.\nC_LIO_LIHuman demographic risk factors included being aged between 10 and 29 years, and being male.\nC_LIO_LIHigh incidence areas for dengue do not predict the occurrence of severe dengue.
Severe dengue was largely localised to lower incidence districts in the east of the state.\nC_LIO_LIThe sole presence of Aedes albopictus in and around the majority of urban and rural case households suggests that this vector may play a major role in facilitating outbreaks.\nC_LI\n\nA complex interplay of risk factors likely mediates dengue transmission in Sabah, influenced by both regional climate trends and localised human and ecological influences.
This study emphasises that the increasing spread of dengue in urban South East Asia is also mirrored in more rural areas, and suggests a need for control strategies that address both urban and rural dengue risk.
Biting rhythm, fecundity and longevity rate of Aedes albopictus (Skuse) females from different urbanized settings in Penang Island, Malaysia under uncontrolled laboratory conditions.
Urbanization could potentially modify Aedes albopictus ecology by changing the dynamics of the species, and increasing the abundance of their breeding sites due to environmental changes, and thus contribute to dengue outbreaks.
An efficient control of the vector requires a deeper understanding on the biological components of this vector.
Thus, this study was conducted to evaluate the biting rhythm, fecundity and longevity rate of Ae.
albopictus in relation to urbanization strata; urban, suburban and rural areas in Penang Island, Malaysia.
Twenty-four hours biting activity of all the mosquito strains showed a clear bimodal biting activity, with morning and evening twilight peaks.
A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) found that there was statistically no significant interaction (F(69,192) = 1.337, P > 0.05) between the effects of biting time and mosquito strains.
Meanwhile, fecundity rates were shown to be statistically significantly different between mosquito strains (F(3,442) = 10.559, P < 0.05) with urban areas having higher mean number of eggs (mean = 107.69, standard error = 3.98) than suburban (mean = 94.48, standard error = 5.18), and rural areas (mean = 72.52, standard error = 3.87).
Longevity rates were significantly higher (F(3,441) = 31.259, P < 0.05) for mosquito strains from urban areas compared to the other strains.
These findings would provide crucial and relevant fundamental information to the planning of control program in Malaysia, particularly Penang.\n\nAuthor SummaryAedes mosquito populations associated with human habitation in urban area do not only have the potential to cause biting nuisance, but also cause significant public health risks through the transmission of dengue virus.
The authors found that in Penang Island, the mean number of eggs laid per female of Aedes albopictus is high in the urban areas than those in suburban and rural areas.
The survivorship is high for urban populations parallel to the fecundity rate and apparent biting pattern which is peak at dawn and dusk was noted for all Ae.
albopictus strains.
The changed environment in the urbanized area where more kinds of breeding containers and more blood sources produced by condensed human population supported by warm climate may facilitate larval development, enhance the vector survivorship and its reproductive fitness.
albopictus in urban areas.
As higher fecundity rate and longer adult survival may enhance disease transmission, this species studied is indeed need high attention in terms of vector control.
Re-introduction of dengue virus serotype 2 in the State of Rio de Janeiro after almost a decade of epidemiological silence  The Asian/American genotype of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) has been introduced in Brazil through the state of Rio de Janeiro around 1990, and since then it has been spreading and evolving, leading to several waves of dengue epidemics throughout the country that cause a major public health problem.
Of particular interest has been the epidemic of 2008, whose highest impact was evidenced in the state of Rio de Janeiro, with a higher number of severe cases and mortality rate, compared to previous outbreaks.
Interestingly, no circulation of DENV-2 was witnessed in this region during the preceding 9-year period.
By early 2010, phylogenetic analysis of the 2008 epidemic strain revealed that the outbreak was caused by a new viral lineage of the Asian/American genotype, which was pointed as responsible for the outbreak severity as well.
The same scenario is repeating in 2019 in this state; however, only a few cases have been detected yet.
To provide information that helps to the understanding of DENV-2 dynamics in the state of Rio de Janeiro, and thereafter contribute to public health control and prevention actions, we employed phylogenetic studies combined with temporal and dynamics geographical features to determine the origin of the current viral strain.
To this effect, we analyzed a region of 1626 nucleotides entailing the Envelope/NS1 viral genes.
Indeed, it seemed to be originated in Puerto Rico around 2002 and has been introduced into the state in late 2018.
Taking into account that no DENV-2 case was reported over the last decade in the state (representing a whole susceptible children generation), and the fact that a new viral strain may be causing current dengue infections, these results will be influential in strengthening dengue surveillance and disease control, mitigating the potential epidemiological consequences of virus spread.\n\nAuthor SummaryBy the time dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) was introduced into Brazil through the state of Rio de Janeiro in 1990, the first dengue hemorrhagic cases started to evidence as well.
Years of seasonal outbreaks were followed by almost ten years oy epidemiological silence in the state.
However, in 2007 this serotype was re-introduced into the state causing one of the worst dengue epidemics ever described in the country.
The same viral genotype was involved, however, a different viral lineage was detected and pointed as responsible for the outbreak severity.
Since new DENV-2 cases are being detected in this region, we analyzed the identity and origin of the viral strain obtained from two infected patients.
Phylogeny combined with temporal and geographical analyses of viral sequences demonstrated that the strain causing 2019s dengue cases belonged to the same lineage as the one causing the outbreak in 2008, but to a different subgroup, and might have originated in Puerto Rico and entered the state in recent times.
Vector competence of Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes for Mayaro virus  Newly emerging or re-emerging arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are important causes of human morbidity and mortality nearly worldwide.
Arboviruses such as Dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), Chikungunya (CHIKV) and West Nile virus (WNV) underwent an extensive geographic expansion in the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world.
In the Americas the main vectors, for DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV, are mosquito species adapted to urban environments namely Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, whereas the main vector for WNV is the Culex quinquefasciatus.
Given the widespread distribution in the Americas and high permissiveness to arbovirus infection, theses mosquito species might pose an important role in the epidemiology of other arboviruses normally associated to sylvatic vectors.
albopictus and Cx.
quinquefasciatus to Mayaro (MAYV) virus, a sylvatic arbovirus transmitted mainly by Haemagogus janthinomys that have been causing an increasing number of outbreaks in South America namely in Brazil.
Using field mosquitoes from Brazil, female mosquitoes were experimentally infected and their competence for dissemination and transmission for MAYV was evaluated.
We found high dissemination rate for MAYV in Ae.
aegypti (57.5%) and Ae.
albopictus (61.6%), whereas very low rates were obtained for Cx.
quinquefasciatus (2.5%).
aegypti and Ae.
albopictus have high transmission ability (69.5% and 71.1% respectively), conversely to Cx.
quinquefasciatus that is not able to transmit the MAYV.
Notably, we found that very low quantities of virus present in the saliva (undetectable by RT-qPCR) were sufficient and virulent enough to guarantee transmission.
aegypti and Ae.
albopictus mosquitoes are not the main vectors for MAYV, our studies suggest that these vectors may play a significant role in the transmission of this arbovirus, since both species showed high vector competence in laboratory conditions.\n\nAuthor summaryThe present study showed that Ae.
aegypti and Ae.
albopictus mosquitoes have high vector competence for MAYV, in laboratory.
In contrast, Cx.
quinquefasciatus mosquitoes were shown to be refractory to MAYV.
Regarding the viral dilution and nanoinjection, higher detection sensitivity was observed after virus nanoinjection into naive mosquitoes, indicating that only a few viral particles are required to infect mosquitoes, and these particles may not be detected by RT-qPCR before the nanoinjection procedure.
Associations between meteorological variables, vector indices and dengue hospitalizations in Can Tho, Vietnam: a field survey  IntroductionDengue is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in Can Tho, a province in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam.
In this region, average temperatures have increased by 0.5{degrees}C since 1980, and river levels have risen.
In a time-series analysis, we previously found that relative humidity was the most important meteorological predictor for dengue hospitalizations in Can Tho.
To better understand proximate factors mediating this association, this study examines weather variables in relation to dengue hospitalization rates, vector indices, container productivity and larval elimination and mosquito avoidance behaviors.\n\nMethodsFour hundred households were sampled bimonthly for one year in Can Tho.
Vector indices of the immature forms of the dengue vector, Aedes aegypti, and the productivity of different types of household containers were determined.
Dengue hospitalization rates were determined for the study period.
Associations between these variables and mean temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, and the number of hours of sun were estimated using mixed effects Poisson regression analysis.
Relative productivity of containers was determined by collecting Ae.
aegypti pupae using a sweep method and adjusting by a calibration factor.
aegypti larval density risk factors were determined using multivariate generalized estimating equations with a negative binomial distribution.
To examine possible mechanisms mediating the relationship between climate, vectors and dengue, we also interviewed households about mosquito avoidance and larval elimination behaviors.\n\nResultsThe house-(HI), container-(CI), Breteau (BI), and pupal (PI) indices were associated with relative humidity (1-month lag, IRRHI=1.10 (95% CI 1.06, 1.13) per 1% increase), IRRCI=1.10 (95% CI 1.02, 1.19), IRRBI=1.17 (95% CI 1.14, 1.21), IRRPI=1.12 (95% CI 1.10, 1.14)).
Vector indices were also associated with precipitation (1-month lag) and to a lesser degree, hours of sun and mean temperature.
aegypti larval density was associated with not cleaning water storage containers (RR=2.50, 95% CI 1.59, 3.66), not having access to municipal waste pick-up (RR=3.15, 95% CI2.09, 4.75), disheveled clothes in the home (RR=1.85, 95% CI 1.24, 2.74) and season (RR[rainy season]=3.10, 95% CI 2.18-4.48).
The most productive containers were water storage containers (relative pupal productivity 87%).
Dengue hospitalization rates were associated with relative humidity (2-month lag, IRR=1.11 (95% CI 1.06, 1.17) per 1% increase).
Only the PI (1-month lag) was significantly associated with dengue hospitalization rates (IRR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00, 1.07).
Mosquito avoidance behaviors were more frequent in the dry season (92.5% vs. 86.0% of interviewees endorsed one or more forms of mosquito prevention, p<0.001).
There was also less use of larval elimination strategies (39.2% vs. 50.5%, p<0.001) during the rainy versus the dry season.\n\nConclusionOur study reveals a strong effect of relative humidity on vector indices and dengue hospitalization rates.
Our findings also demonstrate, however, that during the rainy season when mosquito prevention is most needed, the use of fans, repellant coils and maintenance of water storage containers is actually reduced.
Water storage containers were by far the most productive of pupae, and should be targeted in vector control activities.\n\nAuthor summaryClimate plays an important role in the geographic distribution and burden of disease due to dengue, owing to the vector and virus sensitivity to temperature, humidity, and rainfall.
In the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, where dengue poses a significant health burden, average temperatures have increased by 0.5{degrees}C since 1980.
To better understand the influence of climate on dengue, this study examines its influence on dengue hospitalization rates, vector breeding behavior and human mosquito avoidance behaviors.
We sampled 400 households every 2 months for one year for the presence of the dengue vector, Aedes aegypti, and the productivity of different types of household containers.
Human mosquito avoidance behaviors, such as the use of fans, mosquito repellant, and larval elimination strategies were also recorded.
The association between dengue hospitalizations, mean temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, and the number of hours of sun were established, and risk factors for the abundance of Ae.
aegypti larvae were determined.
We found that relative humidity is positively associated with the presence of Ae.
aegypti immature forms, and that large jars used for water storage serve as the most important source of this vector.
We also determined that people engage in mosquito avoidance/larval elimination strategies more frequently in the dry season versus the rainy season, despite increased vector breeding and dengue hospitalizations during the rainy season.
This temporal disconnect between peak vector activity and dengue hospitalization rates vis-a-vis mosquito control strategies is a potential area for intervention.
On the use of inhibitors of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase as a vector-selective insecticide in the control of mosquitoes  Blood-sucking insects incorporate many times their body weight of blood in a single meal.
As proteins are the major component of vertebrate blood, its digestion in the gut of hematophagous insects generates extremely high concentrations of free amino acids.
Previous reports showed that the tyrosine degradation pathway plays an essential role in adapting these animals to blood feeding.
Inhibiting 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD), the rate-limiting step of tyrosine degradation, results in the death of insects after a blood meal.
Here we have evaluated the toxicity against mosquitoes of three HPPD inhibitors currently used as herbicides and in human health.
Among the compounds tested, nitisinone (NTBC) proved to be more potent than mesotrione (MES) and isoxaflutole (IFT) in Aedes aegypti.
NTBC was lethal to Ae.
aegypti in artificial feeding assays (LD50: 4.36 {micro}M), as well as in topical application (LD50: 0.0033 nmol/mosquito).
NTBC was also lethal to Ae.
aegypti populations that were resistant to neurotoxic insecticides, and it was lethal to other mosquito species (Anopheles and Culex).
Therefore, HPPD inhibitors, particularly NTBC, represent promising new drugs for mosquito control.
Since they only affect blood-feeding organisms, they would represent a safer and more environmentally friendly alternative to conventional neurotoxic insecticides.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe control of mosquitoes has been pursued in the last decades by the use of neurotoxic insecticides to prevent the spreading of dengue, zika and malaria, among other diseases.
However, the selection and propagation of different mechanisms of resistance hinder the success of these compounds.
Hematophagous arthropods, including mosquitoes, ingest quantities of blood that represent many times their body weight in a single meal, releasing huge amounts of amino acids during digestion.
Recent studies showed that inhibition of the tyrosine catabolism pathway could be a new selective target for vector control.
Thus we tested three different inhibitors of the second enzyme in the tyrosine degradation pathway as tools for mosquito control.
Results showed that Nitisinone (NTBC), an inhibitor used in medicine, was the most potent of them.
NTBC was lethal to Aedes aegypti when it was administered together with the blood meal and when it was topically applied.
It also caused the death of Anopheles aquasalis and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, as well as field-collected Aedes populations resistant to neurotoxic insecticides, indicating that there is no cross-resistance.
We discuss the possible use of NTBC as a new insecticide.
Rapid range shifts in African Anopheles mosquitoes over the last century  Facing a warming climate, many tropical species-including the arthropod vectors of several infectious diseases-will be displaced to higher latitudes and elevations.
Here, we use one of the most comprehensive datasets ever compiled by medical entomologists to track the observed range limits of African malaria mosquito vectors (Anopheles spp.)
Using a simple regression approach, we estimate that these species ranges gained an average of 6.5 meters of elevation per year, and the southern limits of their ranges moved polewards 4.7 kilometers per year.
These shifts are consistent with the local velocity of climate change, and might help explain the incursion of malaria transmission into new areas over the past few decades.
Confirming that climate change underlies these shifts, and applying similar methods to other disease vectors, are important directions for future research.
Polymorphism analyses and protein modelling inform on functional specialization of Piwi clade genes in the arboviral vector Aedes albopictus  Current knowledge of the piRNA pathway is based mainly on studies on the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, where three proteins of the Piwi subclade of the Argonaute family interact with PIWI-interacting RNAs to silence transposable elements in gonadal tissues.
In mosquito species that transmit epidemic arboviruses such as the Dengue and Chikungunya viruses, Piwi clade genes underwent expansion, are also expressed in the soma, and code for proteins that may elicit antiviral functions and crosstalk with other proteins of recognized antiviral mechanisms.
These observations underline the importance of expanding our knowledge of the piRNA pathway beyond D. melanogaster.\n\nHere we focus on the emerging arboviral vector Aedes albopictus and we couple traditional approaches of expression and adaptive evolution analyses with most current computational predictions of protein structure to study evolutionary divergence among Piwi clade proteins.
Superposition of protein homology models indicate high structure similarity among all Piwi proteins, with high levels of amino acid conservation in the inner regions devoted to RNA binding.
On the contrary, solvent-exposed surfaces showed low conservation, with several sites under positive selection.
Expression profiles of Piwi transcripts during mosquito development and after infection with the Dengue 1 virus showed a concerted elicitation of all Piwi transcripts during viral dissemination, while the maintenance of infection primarily relied on the expression of Piwi5.
In contrast, establishment of persistent infection by the Chikungunya virus is accompanied by an increased expression of all Piwi genes, particularly Piwi4 and, again, Piwi5.
Overall these results are consistent with functional specialization and a general antiviral role for Piwi5.
Experimental evidences of sites under positive selection in Piwi1/3, Piwi4 and Piwi6, further provide useful knowledge to design tailored functional experiments.\n\nAuthor summaryArgonautes are ancient proteins involved in many cellular processes, including innate immunity.
The use of Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism proved fundamental to understand the function of Argonautes.
However, recent studies showed that the patterns and observations made in D. melanogaster, including the number of Argonautes, their expression profile and their function, are a rarity among Dipterans.\n\nIn vectors of epidemic arboviruses such as Dengue and Chikungunya viruses, Piwi genes underwent expansion, are expressed in the soma, and some of them appear to have antiviral functions.
Besides being an important basic question, the identification of which (and how) Piwi genes have antiviral functions may be used for the development of novel genetic-based strategies of vector control.
Here we coupled population genetics models with computational predictions of protein structure and expression analyses to investigate the evolution and function of Piwi genes of the emerging vector Aedes albopictus.
Instead, the detection of complex expression profiles with the presence of sites under positive selection in Piwi1/3, Piwi4 and Piwi6 requires tailored functional experiments to clarify their antiviral role.
PfGCN5, a global regulator of stress responsive genes, modulates artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum  Plasmodium falciparum has evolved resistance to almost all front-line drugs including artemisinins, which threatens malaria control and elimination strategies.
Oxidative stress and protein damage responses have emerged as key players in the generation of artemisinin resistance.
In this study, we show that PfGCN5, a histone acetyltransferase, binds to the stress responsive and multi-variant family genes in poised state and regulates their expression under stress conditions.
We have also provided biochemical and cellular evidences that PfGCN5 regulates stress responsive genes by acetylation of PfAlba3.
Furthermore, we show that upon artemisinin exposure, genome-wide binding sites for PfGCN5 are increased and it is directly associated with the genes implicated in artemisinin resistance generation like BiP and TRiC chaperone.
Moreover, inhibition of PfGCN5 in artemisinin resistant parasites, Kelch13 mutant, K13I543T and K13C580Y (RSA[~] 25% and 6%, respectively) reverses the sensitivity of the parasites to artemisinin treatment indicating its role in drug resistance generation.
Together, these findings elucidate the role of PfGCN5 as a global chromatin regulator of stress-responses with potential role in modulating artemisinin drug resistance, and identify PfGCN5 as an important target against artemisinin resistant parasites.\n\nAuthor SummaryMalaria parasites are constantly adapting to the drugs we used to eliminate them.
Thus, when we use the drugs to kill parasites; with time, we select the parasites with the favourable genetic changes.
Parasites develop various strategies to overcome exposure to the drugs by exhibiting the stress responses.
In this study, we have identified PfGCN5 as a global transcriptional regulator of stress responses in Plasmodium falciparum.
Inhibition of PfGCN5 reverses the sensitivity of the parasites to the artemisinin drug and identify PfGCN5 as an important target against artemisinin resistant parasites.
Genetic diversity of Collaborative Cross mice controls viral replication, clinical severity and brain pathology induced by Zika virus infection, independently of Oas1b  The explosive spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) has been associated with major variations in severe disease and congenital afflictions among infected populations, suggesting an influence of host genes.
We investigated how genome-wide variants could impact susceptibility to ZIKV infection in mice.
We first describe that the susceptibility of Ifnar1 knockout mice is largely influenced by their genetic background.
We then show that the broad genetic diversity of Collaborative Cross mice, which receptor to type I interferon (IFNAR) was blocked by anti-IFNAR antibody, expressed phenotypes ranging from complete resistance to severe symptoms and death with large variations in the peak and rate of decrease of plasma viral load, in brain viral load, in brain histopathology and in viral replication rate in infected cells.
Differences of susceptibility between CC strains were correlated between Zika, Dengue and West Nile viruses.
We identified highly susceptible and resistant mouse strains as new models to investigate the mechanisms of human ZIKV disease and other flavivirus infections.
Genetic analyses revealed that phenotypic variations are driven by multiple genes with small effects, reflecting the complexity of ZIKV disease susceptibility in human population.
Notably, our results rule out a role of the Oas1b gene in the susceptibility to ZIKV.
Altogether, this study emphasizes the role of host genes in the pathogeny of ZIKV infection and lays the foundation for further genetic and mechanistic studies.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn recent outbreaks, ZIKV has infected millions of people and induced rare but potentially severe complications, including Guillain-Barre syndrome and encephalitis in adults.
While several viral sequence variants were proposed to enhance the pathogenicity of ZIKV, the influence of host genetic variants in the clinical heterogeneity remains mostly unexplored.
We have addressed this question using a mouse panel which models the genetic diversity of human population and a ZIKV strain from a recent clinical isolate.
Through a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches, we demonstrate that multiple host genetic variants determine viral replication in infected cells, and clinical severity, kinetics of blood viral load and brain pathology in mice.
We describe new mouse models expressing high susceptibility or resistance to ZIKV and to other flaviviruses.
Natural infection and vertical transmission of two flaviviruses (Yellow fever and Zika) in mosquitoes in primary forests in the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro (Diptera: Culicidae)  BackgroundZika virus (ZIKV) was recently introduced in the American continent, probably transmitted by Aedes aegypti and possibly by Ae.
albopictus and Culex quinquefasciatus in urban environments.
ZIKV represents a known public health problem as it has been involved in newborn cases of congenital microcephaly in South America since 2005.
The transmission of this virus in forested areas of other countries and its relative ubiquity in relation to its vectors and reservoirs raises suspicions of its adaptation to non-human modified environments (i.e., natural forests reserve) or on this continent, similar to those seen for Yellow fever virus (YFV).
The objective of this work was to have an epidemiological monitoring tool mapping insects as well as circulating arboviruses in wild areas with low human interference.
This study was based on the history of the insect flavivirus spreading cycle.\n\nMethods/Principal FindingsUsing a previously described sensitive PCR-based assay to assess the conserved NS5 region of the Flavivirus genus, both YFV partial genome and ZIKV were found in pools of Aedes albopictus, a sylvatic mosquito adapted to human-modified environments, and in Haemagogus leucocelaenus, a sylvatic mosquito.\n\nConclusionsThis is the first report of natural infection by ZIKV in mosquitoes in a sylvatic environment on the American continent.
The wide distribution of these mosquitoes is probably important in the transmission of ZIKV.
Vertical transmission indicates a higher efficiency for the maintenance and transmission of the virus in nature as well as the presence of the ZIKV in permanent character in the forest areas as it occurs with the YFV thus making more difficult the prevention of new cases of Zika in humans.\n\nAuthor SummaryArboviruses are diseases transmitted by arthropod vectors, hence the origin of the term ARthropod BOrne VIRUS, which is adopted since 1942.
Arboviruses circulate between insects and vertebrate hosts, having importance for promoting diseases in humans and animals.
The diseases most known at the time, due to the recent cases reported by South America, are Dengue, Zika, Yellow Fever and Chikungunya.
After collection, mosquitoes and / or eggs were identified and separated as to the source and species.
The eggs were kept in laboratory conditions for the hatching of new insects.
All the insects obtained were separated into pools to be macerated and thus extract the RNA from the viruses to be studied.
Using molecular biology techniques, in our case the RT-PCR (Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction), we amplified the RNA and in sequentially, we performed the sequencing reaction.
For the identification of the sequences, we need to use some computational programs that guarantee us the correct result.
New genotype invasion of dengue virus serotype 1 drove massive outbreak in Guangzhou, China  BackgroundDengue fever is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that has caused major health problems.
Variations in dengue virus (DENV) genes are important features of epidemic outbreaks.
However, the associations of DENV genes with epidemic scale have not been extensively examined.
Here, we assessed new genotype invasion of DENV-1 isolated from Guangzhou in China to evaluate associations with epidemic outbreaks.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsWe used DENV-1 strains isolated from sera of dengue cases from 2002 to 2016 in Guangzhou for complete genome sequencing.
A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed to elucidate the genotype characteristics and determine if new genotype invasion correlated with major outbreaks.
In our study, a new genotype invasion event was observed during each significant outbreak period in 2002-2003, 2006-2007 and 2013-2014.
Genotype II was the main epidemic genotype in 2003 and before.
Invasion of genotype I in 2006 caused an unusual outbreak with 765 cases (relative risk (RR)=16.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) =12.41-21.25).
At the middle and late stages of the 2013 outbreak, genotype III was introduced to Guangzhou as a new genotype invasion responsible for 37340 cases with RR 541.73 (95%CI=417.78-702.45), after which genotypes I and III began co-circulating.
Base mutations occurred after new genotype invasion, and the gene sequence of NS3 protein had the lowest average similarity ratio (99.82%), followed by the gene sequence of E protein (99.86%), as compared to the 2013 strain.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceGenotype replacement and co-circulation of multiple DENV-1 genotypes were observed.
New genotype invasion was highly correlated with local unusual outbreaks.
In addition to DENV-1 genotype I in the unprecedented outbreak in 2014, new genotype invasion by DENV-1 genotype III occurred in Guangzhou.\n\nAuthor SummaryNew genotype invasion of dengue virus highly correlates with the massive outbreaks.
In this study, we examined the association of the genotype of dengue virus serorype 1 (DENV-1) from human cases through complete genome sequencing with outbreak scale during 2002 and 2016 in Guangzhou, China.
It was observed that genotype replacement and co-circulation of multiple genotypes occurred.
Most importantly, it indicated that new genotype invasion was highly related with local unusual outbreaks in major outbreak periods in 2002-2003, 2006-2007 and 2013-2014.
DENV-1 genotype II was the main epidemic genotype in 2003 and before.
Invasion of genotype I in 2006 caused an unusual outbreak with 765 cases reported.
In addition to genotype I circulation, new genotype invasion by genotype III was the key determinant for the 2014 massive outbreak reaching the highest number of cases with 37340.
Furthermore, base mutations appeared after genotype III invasion, and the gene sequence of NS3 protein had the lowest average similarity ratio, followed by the gene sequence of E protein, as compared to the 2013 strain.
Functional activity of antisera against recombinant Zika virus envelope protein subunits expressed in Escherichia coli  The global Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak across continents has been drawing research attentions to researchers and healthcare professionals.
It highlights the urgent development of ZIKV vaccines that offer rapid, precise and specific protection to those living in the high-risk regions - the tropical and subtropical regions.
As a public health priority, there is a progressive development in the discovery of vaccine candidates and design in recent years.
Many efforts have been placed in the in vitro development of ZIKV subunits as the vaccine candidate in various protein expression systems, including bacteria, yeast, plant cells, insect cells and mammalian cells.
However, due to the lack of knowledge on humoral and cellular immune responses against virus vaccines, a commercialised vaccine against Dengue virus (DENV) has been suspended due to a health scare in Philippines.
Moreover, the closely-related DENV and ZIKV has indicated serological cross-reactivity between both viruses.
In this study, we pre-selected, synthesised and expressed the domain III of ZIKV envelope protein (namely rEDIII) based on a previously-established report (GenBank: AMC13911.1).
The characteristics of purified ZIKV rEDIII was tested using SDS-PAGE, Western blotting and LC-MS/MS.
Since the ZIKV rEDIII has been well reported as a potential protein candidate in ZIKV vaccine development, we assessed the possible outcome of preexisting immunity against the rEDIII proteins by conducting dot-blotting assays using mice antisera pre-immunised with ZIKV particles (ZIKV strain: MRS_OPY_Martinique_PaRi_2015, GenBank: KU647676).
Surprisingly, the antisera was able to recognise the rEDIII of a different ZIKV strain (GenBank: AMC13911.1).
Despite its great antigenicity in eliciting humoral and cellular immunity against ZIKV infection, our finding calls for greater attention to evaluate the details of ZIKV rEDIII as a stand-alone vaccine candidate.
HLA upregulation during dengue virus infection suppresses the natural killer cell response  Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent mosquito-borne virus in the world and a major cause of morbidity in the tropics and subtropics.
Upregulation of HLA class I molecules has long been considered a feature of DENV infection, yet this has not been evaluated in the setting of natural infection.
Natural killer (NK) cells, an innate immune cell subset critical for mounting an early response to viral infection, are inhibited by self HLA class I, suggesting that upregulation of HLA class I during DENV infection could dampen the NK cell response.
Here we addressed whether upregulation of HLA class I molecules occurs during in vivo DENV infection and, if so, whether this suppresses the NK cell response.
We found that HLA class I expression was indeed upregulated during acute DENV infection across multiple cell lineages in vivo.
To better understand the role of HLA class I upregulation, we infected primary human monocytes, a major target of DENV infection, in vitro.
Upregulation of total HLA class I is dependent on active viral replication and is mediated in part by cytokines and other soluble factors induced by infection, while upregulation of HLA-E occurs in the presence of replication-incompetent virus.
Importantly, blocking DENV-infected monocytes with a pan-HLA class I Fab nearly doubles the frequency of degranulating NK cells, while blocking HLA-E does not significantly improve the NK cell response.
These findings demonstrate that upregulation of HLA class I during DENV infection suppresses the NK cell response, potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis.
Co-occurrence of kdr mutations V1016I and F1534C in pyrethroid-resistant Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) populations from Costa Rica  Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762) is considered the most important mosquito vector species for several arboviruses (e.g., dengue, chikungunya, Zika) in Costa Rica.
The main strategy for the control and prevention of Aedes-borne diseases relies on insecticide-based vector control.
However, the emergence of insecticide resistance in the mosquito populations present a big threat for the prevention actions.
The characterization of the mechanisms driving the insecticide resistance in Ae.
aegypti are vital for decision making in vector control programs.
Therefore, we analyzed the voltage-gated sodium channel gene for the presence of the V1016I and F1534C kdr mutations in pyrethroid-resistant Ae.
aegypti populations from Puntarenas and Limon provinces, Costa Rica.
The CDC bottle bioassays showed that both Costa Rican Ae.
aegypti populations were resistant to permethrin and deltamethrin.
In the case of kdr genotyping, results revealed the co-occurrence of V1016I and F1534C mutations in permethrin and deltamethrin-resistant populations, as well as the fixation of the 1534C allele.
aegypti which must be a priority to develop an effective resistance management plan.
Interdependence between confirmed and discarded cases of dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses in Brazil: A multivariate time-series analysis  The co-circulation of different arboviruses in the same time and space poses a significant threat to public health given their rapid geographic dispersion and serious health, social, and economic impact.
In this work, a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model was developed to investigate the interrelationships between discarded and confirmed cases of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in Brazil.
We used data from the Brazilian National Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) from 2010 to 2017.
There were three peaks in the series of dengue notification in this period occurring in 2013, 2015 and in 2016.
The series of reported cases of both Zika and chikungunya reached their peak in late 2015 and early 2016.
The VAR model shows that the Zika series have a significant impact on the dengue series and vice versa, suggesting that several discarded and confirmed cases of dengue could actually have been cases of Zika.
The model also suggests that the series of confirmed and discarded chikungunya cases are almost independent of the cases of Zika, however, affecting the series of dengue.
In conclusion, co-circulation of arboviruses with similar symptoms could have lead to misdiagnosed diseases in the surveillance system.
We argue that the routinely use of mathematical and statistical models in association with traditional symptom-surveillance could help to decrease such errors and to provide early indication of possible future outbreaks.
These findings address the challenges regarding notification biases and shed new light on how to handle reported cases based only in clinical-epidemiological criteria when multiples arboviruses co-circulate in the same population.
Author summaryArthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) transmission is a growing health problem worldwide.
The real epidemiological impact of the co-circulation of different arboviruses in the same urban spaces is a recent phenomenon and there are many issues to explore.
This establishes a challenge to identify, distinguish and estimate the number of infections when different arboviruses co-circulate.
We propose the use of multivariate time series analysis to understand how the weekly notification of suspected cases of dengue, chikungunya and Zika, in Brazil, affected each other.
Our results suggest that the series of Zika significantly impact on the series of dengue and vice versa, indicating that several discarded and confirmed cases of dengue might actually have been Zika cases.
The results also suggest that the series of confirmed cases of chikungunya are almost independent of those of dengue and Zika.
Our findings shed light on yet hidden aspects on the co-circulation of these three viruses based on reported cases.
We believe the present work provides a new perspective on the longitudinal analysis of arboviruses transmission and call attention to the challenge in dealing with biases in case notifications when multiple arboviruses circulate in the same urban environment.
Arbovirus Vectors of Epidemiological Concern in the Americas: A Scoping Review of Entomological Studies on Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya Virus Vectors  BackgroundThree arthorpod-borne viruses (arboviruses) causing human disease have been the focus of a large number of studies in the Americas since 2013 due to their global spread and epidemiological impacts: Zika, dengue, and chikungunya viruses.
A large proportion of infections by these viruses are asymptomatic.
However, all three viruses are associated with moderate to severe health consequences in a small proportion of cases.
Two mosquito species, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, are among the worlds most prominent arboviral vectors, and are known primary vectors for all three viruses in the Americas.\n\nObjectivesThis review summarizes the state of the entomological literature surrounding the biology and ecology of vectors of Zika, dengue and chikungunya viruses and factors affecting virus transmission.
The rationale of the review was to elucidate consensus and discord between studies, and guide future research based on identified knowledge gaps.\n\nResultsA total of 196 studies were included in the scoping review after initial screening and subsequent exclusion of out-of-scope studies, secondary data publications, duplicate records, and studies unavailable in English language.\n\nKey findingsTemperature and humidity have the strongest impact on mosquito distribution and dynamics, development of immatures and arborviral infection rates.
Low socioeconomic status and related factors, including poor infrastructure, inconsistent access to water, and high household resident density, have been consistently associated with arbovirus vector occurrence.
Effects of interspecific competition on arboviral vector species is currently poorly understood.
Vector competence for Zika virus is well established for Ae.
aegypti and Ae.
Information on Zika virus vector transmission dynamics is sparse in contrast to the wealth of research available for dengue and chikungunya viruses.\n\nConclusionsBased on the internationally recognized urgency of Zika virus infection as a public health concern, further research on arbovirus vectors and transmission dynamics is of pressing need.
Does membrane feeding compromise the quality of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes?
Modified Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are being mass-reared for release in disease control programs around the world.
Releases involving female mosquitoes rely on them being able to seek and feed on human hosts.
When reared across generations there is a risk that mosquitoes will adapt to feeding on membranes and lose their ability to feed on human hosts.
aegypti for feeding on either human arms or membrane feeders for at least 8 generations.
Membrane-selected populations suffered fitness costs, likely due to inbreeding depression arising from bottlenecks.
Membrane-selected females had higher feeding rates on membranes than human-selected ones, suggesting adaptation to membrane feeding, but they maintained their attraction to host cues and feeding ability on humans despite a lack of selection for these traits.
Host-seeking ability in small laboratory cages did not differ between populations selected on the two blood sources, but membrane-selected females were compromised in a semi-field enclosure where host-seeking was tested over a longer distance.
However, large population sizes during mass rearing with membrane feeders should be maintained to avoid bottlenecks which lead to inbreeding depression.\n\nAuthor summaryWith modified mosquitoes being mass-reared for release in disease control programs, there is interest in understanding factors that can affect the quality of release stocks.
In the laboratory, membrane feeding devices are often used to provide blood to female mosquitoes which they need to lay eggs.
Adaptation could affect the performance of lab-reared mosquitoes when deployed in the field, especially if the success of disease control programs relies on female reproduction such as in gene drive or Wolbachia-based approaches.
We tested to see if Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the principal vectors of dengue virus, would adapt to feeding on blood provided via membranes.
We found some evidence of adaptation, with membrane-selected mosquitoes having higher feeding rates on membranes, but this didnt affect their ability to feed on humans or their attraction to host cues.
Although membrane feeding alone does not substantially affect mosquito quality, it can lead to inbreeding depression if populations pass through bottlenecks as they adapt to feeding on blood provided artificially.
Our results may inform mass-rearing programs involving the release of modified female mosquitoes.
Identification of Leishmania donovani inhibitors from pathogen box compounds of Medicine for Malaria Venture  Leishmaniasis is a collective term used to describe various pathological conditions caused by an obligate intracellular protozoan of the genus Leishmania.
It is one of the neglected diseases and has been given low attention in drug discovery researches to narrow the existing gap in safety and efficacy of the currently used drugs to treat leishmaniasis.
The challenge is further exacerbated by the emergence of drug resistance by the parasites.
Aiming to look for potential anti-leishmanial hits and leads, we screened MMV Pathogen Box against clinically isolated L. donovani strain.
Compounds were screened against promastigote, and then against amastigote stages; of which, 35 compounds showed >50% inhibition on promastigotes in the initial screen (1 M).
Out of these compounds, 9 compounds showed >70% inhibition with median inhibitory concentration (IC50) ranges from 12 nM to 491 nM on anti-promastigote assay and 53 to 704 nM on intracellular amastigote assay.
Identified compounds demonstrated good safety on THP-1 cell lines and sheep RBCs, and appropriate physico-chemical property suitable for further drug development.
Two compounds (MMV690102 and MMV688262) were identified as lead compounds.
Among these compounds, anti-tubercular agent MMV688262 (delamanid) showed synergistic effect with amphotericin B, indicating the prospect of this compound for combination therapy.
The current study indicates the presence of additional hits which may hold promise as starting points for anti-leishmanial drug discovery and in-depth structure activity relationship studies.
Future works also needs to investigate antiamastigotes activity of remaining  hits, which were not covered in the present study.\n\nAuthors summaryVisceral leishmaniasis is a major public health problem in endemic regions.
Different drugs have been used to treat visceral leishmaniasis.
New chemical entities that overcome the limitations of existing drugs are therefore desperately needed.
Screening of 400 pathogen box compounds against of Leishmania donovani clinical isolate resulted in identification of 35 compounds with >50% inhibition against promastigotes at 1 M. Out of these compounds, 9 showed >70% inhibition with median inhibitory concentration ranges from 12 nM to 491 nM on anti-promastigote assay, and 53 to 704 nM on intracellular amastigote assay.
Early identification of dengue virus lineage replacement in Brazil using portable genomic surveillance  Over 400 million people are estimated to be at risk of acquiring dengue virus (DENV).
Despite efforts to mitigate the impact of DENV epidemics, the virus remains a public health problem in the Americas: more than one million DENV cases were reported in the continent between January and July 2019 DENV was first detected in Brazil in 1982, and Brazil has reported 88% (1,127,244 cases) of all DENV cases in the Americas during 2019 to date.
Sao Paulo state in the southeast of Brazil has reported nearly half of all DENV infections in the country.
Here we characterised the genetic diversity of DENV strains circulating in Sao Paulo state in 2019, at the epicentre of the ongoing DENV epidemic.
Using portable nanopore sequencing we generated 20 new DENV genome sequences from viremic patients with suspected dengue infection residing in two of the most-affected municipalities, Araraquara and Sao Jose do Rio Preto.
We conducted a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis with 1,630 global DENV strains to better understand the evolutionary history of the DENV lineages that currently circulate in the region.
The new outbreak strains were classified as DENV2 genotype III (American/Asian genotype).
Notably, phylogenetic analysis indicated that the 2019 outbreak is the result of a novel DENV lineage that was recently introduced to Brazil from the Caribbean region.
Our genetic analysis further indicates that the introduction and onwards spread of the outbreak lineage (named here DENV2-III BR-4) indicates a new DENV2 lineage replacement in Brazil.
Dating phylogeographic analysis suggests that DENV2-III BR-4 was introduced to Brazil in or around early 2014, possibly from the Caribbean region.
Our study describes the early detection of a newly introduced and rapidly-expanding DENV2 virus lineage in Brazil.\n\nAuthor SummaryDengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease of humans.
The disease is caused by the dengue virus (DENV) that is classified within genus Flavivirus.
DENV infections are caused by 4 serotypes (DENV 1-4) that are genetically related but antigenically distinct.
Dengue infection results in a variety of symptoms that range from mild fever to dengue hemorrhagic fever and/or dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS).
As a re-emerging infectious disease, DENV has become a serious threat to public health in the Americas, and particularly in Brazil, where it was introduced in the 1980s and became well established due to the country-wide re-infestation of the Aedes aegypti mosquito vector species.
During the first six months of 2019, 1,282,183 DENV cases were reported in the Americas, with Brazil reporting a staggering 1,127,244 (88%) of all dengue cases in the continent.
To date, no information exists on the genetic composition of the DENV lineage or lineages causing the current epidemic.
Here we use portable sequencing to rapidly generate virus genome data from cases occurring in two different are severely-affected municipalities in Sao Paulo state, Brazil.
We find that the 2019 dengue outbreak in Brazil is caused by a newly introduced DENV serotype 2 genotype III (Asian/American) that seems to be replacing previously-circulating DENV2 lineages.
Structural variation of the malaria-associated human glycophorin A-B-E region  Approximately 5% of the human genome consists of structural variants, which are enriched for genes involved in the immune response and cell-cell interactions.
A well-established region of extensive structural variation is the glycophorin gene cluster, comprising three tandemly-repeated regions about 120kb in length, carrying the highly homologous genes GYPA, GYPB and GYPE.
Glycophorin A and glycophorin B are glycoproteins present at high levels on the surface of erythrocytes, and they have been suggested to act as decoy receptors for viral pathogens.
They act as receptors for invasion of a causative agent of malaria, Plasmodium falciparum.
A particular complex structural variant (DUP4) that creates a GYPB/GYPA fusion gene is known to confer resistance to malaria.
Here, we analyse sequences from 6466 genomes from across the world for structural variation at the glycophorin locus, confirming 15 variants in the 1000 Genomes project cohort, discovering 9 new variants, and characterising a selection using fibre-FISH and breakpoint mapping.
We identify variants predicted to create novel fusion genes and a common inversion duplication variant at appreciable frequencies in West Africans.
We show that almost all variants can be explained by unequal cross over events (non-allelic homologous recombination, NAHR) and.
by comparing the structural variant breakpoints with recombination hotspot maps, show the importance of a particular meiotic recombination hotspot on structural variant formation in this region.
Field evaluation of a quantitative, and rapid malaria diagnostic system using a fluorescent Blue-ray optical device  We improved a previously developed quantitative malaria diagnostic system based on fluorescent Blue-ray optical device.
Here, we first improved the diagnostic system to enable fully automated operation and the field application was evaluated in Kenya.
We detected Plasmodium falciparum in blood samples collected from 288 individuals aged 1-16 years using nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR), rapid diagnostic test (RDT), and automated system.
Compared to RDT, the automated system exhibited a higher sensitivity (100%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 93.3-100%) and specificity (92.8%; 95%CI, 88.5-95.8%).
The limit of detection was 0.0061%.
Linear regression analysis revealed a correlation between the automated system and microscopic examination for detecting parasitemia (adjusted R2 value=0.63, P=1.13x10-12).
The automated system exhibited a stable quantification of parasitemia and a higher diagnostic accuracy for parasitemia than RDT.
Screening the MMV Open Access Pathogen box unveils novel and potent inhibitors of Amoebiasis agent: Entamoeba histolytica  Amoebiasis caused by the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica remains a major public health hazard, as being the second cause of death among parasitic infections.
In this regard, the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) Pathogen Box library of selected compounds was screened to identify anti-Entamoeba histolytica agents using the resazurin based fluorescence assay.
Overall, the results revealed three novel anti-Entamoeba histolytica scaffolds with low micromolar activity including MMV675968 (IC50 = 2.10 {micro}M), MMV688179 (IC50 = 2.38 {micro}M) and MMV688844 (IC50 = 5.63 {micro}M).
Structure-Activity-Relationship (SAR) studies led to identification of two analogs [~]100 fold more potent and selective than the original hit compound 1 (MMV675968): 1k (IC50 = 0.043 {micro}M) and 1l (IC50 = 0.055 {micro}M).
Predictive analysis using Maestro 11.6 suggested that these hit compounds possess acceptable physicochemical and metabolism properties.
These lead compounds are therefore good starting points for lead optimization studies towards identification of drug candidate against amoebiasis.\n\nAuthor SummaryDiarrhoea is a leading cause of death for millions of children worldwide.
One of the top 15 causes of severe diarrhoea is Entamoeba histolytica, causing amoebiasis.
What makes E. histolytica dangerous is its ability to disseminate easily through a given population via contaminated food and water supplies.
Moreover, E. histolytica is quite comfortable in the environment, difficult to kill with chorine and infect people at a very low dose, making it a priority pathogen to eradicate.
However, they are not efficient enough to control the disease due to pathogen resistance that is becoming a big issue.
Therefore, new, more efficient and less toxic drugs are urgently needed for the better management of amoebiasis.
Using this same approach, we have identified two compounds that potently inhibit E. histolytica and are nontoxic that can enter the drug discovery pipeline for new amoebicidal drug development.
Moreover, these new inhibitors could also serve as starting points for the synthesis of a library of amoebicidal compounds.
Phenotype and functionality of follicular helper T cells in patients with acute dengue infection  BackgroundThe association of functionality and phenotype of follicular helper T cells (Tfh) with dengue virus (DENV) specific antibody responses and clinical disease severity is has not been well studied.\n\nMethodology/Principal findingsWe investigated the phenotype and functionality of Tfhs in adult patients (DF = 18, DHF = 22) with acute dengue of varying severity using multiparametric flowcytometry.
We determined if the properties of Tfhs were correlated with viraemia, disease severity, plasmablast responses and DENV-specific serum antibody responses.
We further evaluated the changes in neutralizing antibodies (Neut50) with viraemia and clinical disease severity in a different cohort of patients with acute secondary DENV1 (DF=12, DHF=10) and DENV2 infection (DF=8, DHF=9).\n\nTfhs (especially those producing IL-21 and co-expressing PD-1 and ICOS) were found to be significantly expanded (p<0.0001) and highly activated in patients with DHF compared to those with DF.
The frequency of Tfh cells significantly correlated with DENV-specific IgG, NS1-specific antibodies and Neut50 antibody titres, which were also significantly higher in patients with DHF.
Although the Neut50 titres increased during the course of acute secondary DENV infection, they showed differences based on serotype.
For instance, the Neut50 titres were significantly higher during the latter part of illness in patients with DF compared DHF in DENV1 infection, while in DENV2, patients with DHF had significantly higher titres.
The viral loads during early illness did not correlate with the subsequent rise in the Neut50 antibody titres during time point of illness.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceThe expansion of Tfhs is associated with DHF and DENV-specific IgG, NS1-specific and neutralising antibodies.
Neut50 titres did not associate with disease severity or viraemia at the point of first presentation during the febrile phase, but later titres do show differential association with severity in patients with DENV1 compared to DENV2.\n\nAuthor summaryFollicular helper T cells (Tfh cells) are a subset of T cells which are important in activation of germinal centre T cells and induction of long-lasting virus specific antibodies.
The association of the functional status and phenotype of Tfh cells in relation to dengue virus (DENV) specific antibodies, clinical disease severity and the degree of viraemia in patients with acute dengue has not been extensively studied.
Here we show that the Tfh cells are significantly expanded in patients with severe clinical disease and associate with levels of serum DENV envelop specific IgG, NS1-specific antibodies and neutralising antibodies (Neu50).
Although DENV Neu50 antibody titres are thought to associate with protection, the Neut50 antibody titres were similar in patients who proceeded to develop mild or severe clinical disease and also the increase in their titres showed significant variation based on infecting DENV serotype and clinical disease severity.
Therefore, although Tfh cells are expanded in patients with more severe forms of disease, and associate with DENV-specific antibody responses, they do not appear to have a protective role.
Comparative Analysis of Acoustic Propagation Parameters of Natural Sounds of Anopheles gambiae s.s and Odorrana tormota Significant in Mosquito Startle  Acoustics of varied frequency ranges generated naturally by animals or artificially by electronic devices have shown startle effect to insects.
It has been shown that mosquitoes use the reactive near-field in antennae communication with negative phonotaxis in male Aedes diantaeus evoked by low frequency acoustic signals of a carrier frequency 140-200 Hz.
Also, studies with the 35-60 kHz Odorrana tormota sound recorded a 46 % repellence in female Anopheles gambiae, the malaria vectors.
Declining malaria morbidity and mortality is attributed to current vector and pathogen interventions.
However, the rate of decline in malaria morbidity and mortality is impeded by buildup of resistance in pathogens and vectors to chemicals.
This study therefore characterised animal sounds essential for further investigation in the control of malaria through mosquito startle.
The research determined, analysed and compared the acoustic propagation parameters of the recorded natural sounds of the male Anopheles gambiae, female Anopheles gambiae and Odorrana tormota using Avisoft SASLAB Pro and Raven Pro 1.5.
All sounds were observed to have frequency modulation with harmonics stretching to ultrasonic levels.
Uniquesly, the sound of O. tormota showed constant frequency modulation.
The pupae of A. gambiae were reared in vials quarter filled with water and covered with a net at 60-80 % humidity, 25{+/-}2 {degrees}C temperature and equal light-darkness hour cycle at Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) entomology laboratories.
The parameters showed a significant deference in fundamental frequency (maximum entire), Peak amplitude (maximum), peak amplitude (mean), Peak amplitude (mean entire) and peak amplitude (maximum entire) of the sound of male A. gambiae and O. tormota (p < 0.05).

The maximum frequency (mean) of the sounds of both sexes of A. gambiae correlated highly negative (r = -0.658).
The bandwidth (end), bandwidth (maximum), bandwidth (maximum entire), peak amplitude (mean) and bandwidth (mean entire) of the sound of the male compared with female A. gambiae differed significantly.
The signal power for the non-pulsate sounds of the male A. gambiae remained almost constant at 80 dB from 10 kHz to 65 kHz beyond which the acoustic energy declining to 45 dB.
Also, the sounds of the female A. gambiae did not exhibit any spikes in power but remained steady at 85 dB from 10 kHz up to 60 kHz beyond which the acoustic energy declined to 50 dB.
The signal power of the pulsate sound of O. tormota was 89 dB.
The propagation parameters of the male mosquito and O. tormota compared favourably indicating its potential in the startle of the female mosquito.\n\nThe author summaryPhilip Amuyunzu Mangare is a PhD.

Pan-active imidazolopiperazine antimalarials target the Plasmodium falciparum intracellular secretory pathway  AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWOne of the most promising new compound classes in clinical development for the treatment of malaria is the imidazolopiperazines (IZPs) class.
Human trials have demonstrated that members of the IZP series, which includes KAF156 (Ganaplacide) and GNF179, are potent and effective against Plasmodium symptomatic asexual blood-stage infections.
Unlike other commonly used antimalarials, they also prevent transmission and block future infection in animal models.
Despite the identification of several Plasmodium falciparum resistance mechanisms including mutations in ER-localized PfCARL (PfEMP65), Acetyl-coA transporter, and PfUGT transporter, IZPs mechanism of action remains unknown.\n\nTo investigate, we combined in vitro evolution and whole-genome analysis in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae with molecular, metabolomic, and chemogenomic methods, in P. falciparum.
S. cerevisiae clones that resist IZP activity carry multiple mutations in genes that encode endoplasmic reticulum(ER)-based lipid homeostasis and autophagy including elo2, elo3, sur2, atg15 and lcb4, as well as ER-based sec66.
In Plasmodium, IZPs cause inhibition of protein trafficking, block the establishment of new permeation pathways and result in ER expansion.
We also observe sensitization with other secretion inhibitors such as brefeldin A and golgicidin as well as synthetic lethality with PfSEC62.
Our data show that IZPs target the secretory pathway and highlight a novel mechanism for blocking parasite growth and development that is distinct from those of standard compounds used to treat malaria.
In addition, we provide physiological signatures and hallmarks for inhibitors that work through this mechanism of action and show that IZPs are tool compounds for studying ER-dependent protein processing in different species.
Successes of artemisinin elicitation in low-artemisinin producing Artemisia annua cell cultures constrained by repression of biosynthetic genes  The sesquiterpene phytolactone derived from Artemisia annua, artemisinin is associated with a variety of novel biological properties, such as immunoregulatory and anticancer effects, and therapeutic applications, apart from its main function as an antimalarial drug.
Emerging from the fact that artemisinin production in planta occurs in trace amounts and its compartmentalized synthesis, the irregular agricultural supply often results in market fluctuations and reductions in artemisinin inventory.
Further improvement in artemisinin production calls for approaches that act in a supplementary manner, filling the agricultural production gap.
Here we investigated the elicitation efficiency of ultraviolet B (UV-B) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) independently on a low-artemisinin producing (LAP) chemotype of the species A. annua.
The exposure of cell suspension cultures to short-term UV-B radiation and DMSO treatment did not result in significant changes in artemisinin yield.
The lack of stimulation has been associated with: (i) the general lack of cytodifferentiation of cell cultures; (ii) negative feedback regulation of artemisinin biosynthesis; and (iii) artemisinin sequestration by cellular detoxification.
Further molecular analysis revealed the repression of key genes ADS, DBR2 and ALDH1 which affected artemisinin synthesis.
This study provides insights into the complexity of stress-induced responses of A. annua cell suspension cultures in relation to metabolic processes (transportation, accumulation and degradation of secondary products) which are important for artemisinin formation.
Structure-guided design of a synthetic mimic of an EPCR-binding PfEMP1 protein  Structure-guided vaccine design provides a route to elicit a focused immune response against the most functionally important regions of a pathogen surface.
This can be achieved by identifying epitopes for neutralizing antibodies through structural methods and recapitulating these epitopes by grafting their core structural features onto smaller scaffolds.
We focused on the PfEMP1 protein family found on the surfaces of erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium falciparum.
A subset of PfEMP1 proteins bind to endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), and their expression correlates with development of the symptoms of severe malaria.
Structural studies revealed the PfEMP1 to present a helix-kinked-helix motif which forms the core of the EPCR binding site.
Using Rosetta-based design we successfully grafted this motif onto a three-helical bundle scaffold.
We show that this synthetic binder interacts with EPCR with nanomolar affinity and adopts the expected structure.
We also assessed its ability to bind to antibodies found in immunized animals and in humans from malaria endemic regions.
Finally, we tested its capacity to effectively elicit antibodies that prevent EPCR binding and analysed the degree of cross-reactivity of these antibodies across a diverse repertoire of EPCR-binding PfEMP1.
Protein ubiquitylation is essential for the schizont to merozoite transition in Plasmodium falciparum blood-stage development  Ubiquitylation is a common post translational modification of eukaryotic proteins and in the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) overall ubiquitylation increases in the transition from intracellular schizont to extracellular merozoite stages in the asexual blood stage cycle.
Here, we identify specific ubiquitylation sites of protein substrates in three intracellular parasite stages and extracellular merozoites; a total of 1464 sites in 546 proteins were identified (data available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD014998).
469 ubiquitylated proteins were identified in merozoites compared with only 160 in the preceding intracellular schizont stage, indicating a large increase in protein ubiquitylation associated with merozoite maturation.
Following merozoite invasion of erythrocytes, few ubiquitylated proteins were detected in the first intracellular ring stage but as parasites matured through trophozoite to schizont stages the extent of ubiquitylation increased.
We identified commonly used ubiquitylation motifs and groups of ubiquitylated proteins in specific areas of cellular function, for example merozoite pellicle proteins involved in erythrocyte invasion, exported proteins, and histones.
To investigate the importance of ubiquitylation we screened ubiquitin pathway inhibitors in a parasite growth assay and identified the ubiquitin activating enzyme (UBA1 or E1) inhibitor MLN7243 (TAK-243) to be particularly effective.
This small molecule was shown to be a potent inhibitor of recombinant PfUBA1, and a structural homology model of MLN7243 bound to the parasite enzyme highlights avenues for the development of P. falciparum specific inhibitors.
We created a genetically modified parasite with a rapamycin-inducible functional deletion of uba1; addition of either MLN7243 or rapamycin to the recombinant parasite line resulted in the same phenotype, with parasite development blocked at the late schizont stage.
These results indicate that the intracellular target of MLN7243 is UBA1, and this activity is essential for the final differentiation of schizonts to merozoites.
The ubiquitylation of many merozoite proteins and their disappearance in ring stages are consistent with the idea that ubiquitylation leads to their destruction via the proteasome once their function is complete following invasion, which would allow amino acid recycling in the period prior to the parasites elaboration of a new food vacuole.
Genotyping complex structural variation at the malaria-associated human glycophorin locus using a PCR-based strategy  Structural variation in the human genome can affect risk of disease.
An example is a complex structural variant of the human glycophorin gene cluster, called DUP4, which is associated with a clinically-significant level of protection against severe malaria.
The human glycophorin gene cluster harbours at least 23 distinct structural variants and accurate genotyping of this complex structural variation remains a challenge.
Here, we use a PCR-based strategy to genotype structural variation at the human glycophorin gene cluster.
We validate our approach, based on a triplex paralogue ratio test (PRT) combined with junction-fragment specific PCR, on publically-available samples from the 1000 Genomes project.
We then genotype a longitudinal birth cohort using small amounts of DNA at low cost.
It will allow exploration of genetic variation at the glycophorin locus, and investigation of its relationship with malaria, in large sample sets at minimal cost, using standard molecular biology equipment.
A limited role for autophagy during arbovirus infection of mosquito cells  Macroautophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular process critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis.
It can additionally function as an innate immune response to viral infection as has been demonstrated for a number of arthropod-borne (arbo-) viruses.
Arboviruses are maintained in a transmission cycle between vertebrate hosts and invertebrate vectors yet the majority of studies assessing autophagy-arbovirus interactions have been limited to the mammalian host.
Therefore we evaluated the role of autophagy during arbovirus infection of the invertebrate vector using the tractable Aag2 Aedes aegypti mosquito cell culture system.
Our data demonstrates that autophagy is significantly induced in mosquito cells upon infection with two flaviviruses, dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), as well as an unrelated mosquito-borne virus, chikungunya virus (CHIKV; Togaviridae).
Both induction and suppression of autophagy via torin 1 and spautin-1, respectively, resulted in increased viral titers for all three viruses, yet suppression of autophagy-related genes had no effect.
Interestingly, chemical modulators of autophagy had either no effect or opposite effects in another widely used mosquito cell line, C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells.
Together, our data reveals a limited role for autophagy during arbovirus infection of mosquito cells.
Further, our findings suggest that commonly used chemical modulators of autophagy alter mosquito cells in such a way as to promote viral replication; however, it is unclear if this occurs directly through autophagic manipulation or other means.\n\nAuthor SummaryArthropod-borne (arbo) viruses, specifically those transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, cause significant morbidity and mortality and pose a continued public health threat worldwide.
For these reasons, identifying vulnerabilities within the transmission cycle that can be targeted will be critical to the development of novel control interventions.
Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular pathway and previous studies manipulating this pathway have shown promise in minimizing viral infections in mammalian hosts.
In this study we examined arbovirus-autophagy interactions within vector mosquitoes.
The goal was to elucidate the role of autophagy during infection of mosquitoes in hopes of identifying critical interactions that can be targeted by novel approaches to block infection of and transmission by vector mosquitoes.
Developing a dengue forecast model using Long Short Term Memory neural networks method  BackgroundDengue Fever (DF) is a tropical mosquito-borne disease that threatens public health and causes enormous economic burdens worldwide.
In China, DF expanded from coastal region to inner land, and the incidence sharply increased in the last few years.
In this study, we conduct the analysis of dengue using the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks.
This is an artificial intelligence technology, to develop a precise dengue forecast model.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsThe model is developed from monthly dengue cases and local meteorological data of 2005-2018 among top 20 Chinese cities with a record of the highest dengue incidence.
The first 13 year data were used to construct the LSTM and to predict the dengue outbreaks in 2018.
The results are compared with the estimated dengue cases of other previously published models.
Model performance and prediction accuracy were assessed using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
With the LSTM method, the prediction measurements of average RMSE drop by 54.79% and 34.76% as compared with the Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) model and Zero Inflated Generalized Additive Model (ZIGAM).
Our results showed that if only local data were used to develop forecast models, the LSTM neural networks would fail to capture the transmission characteristics of dengue virus in areas with fewer dengue cases.
Contrarily, transfer learning (TL) can improve the accuracy of prediction of the LSTM neural network model in areas with fewer dengue incidences.\n\nConclusion and significanceThe LSTM model is beneficial in predicting dengue incidence as compared with other previously published forecasting models.
The findings provide a more precise forecast dengue model, which can help the local government and health-related departments respond early to dengue epidemics.\n\nAuthor summaryIn China, DF is a public health concern that poses a great economic burden on local governments.
However, the incidence has sharply increased in recent years with growth in the sub-regions.
With this issue, it will be challenging to develop an accurate and timely dengue forecast model.
LSTM recurrent neural networks, deep learning methods and virus propagation rules by learning from observational data offer more advantages in predicting the prevalence of infectious disease dynamics than the traditional statistical model.
The 2005-2017 data of the top 20 Chinese cities with the highest dengue incidence were used to construct the LSTM model, advantageous in predicting dengue in most cities.
Moreover, the model helped to predict the dengue outbreaks in 2018 and used to compare the estimated dengue cases with the RMSE results of other previously published models.
A thorough search of the literature shows that this is the first established dengue forecast model using the LSTM method, which is effective in predicting the trend of dengue dynamics.
Parameter fitting using time-scale analysis for vector borne diseases with spatial dynamics  Vector-borne diseases are becoming increasingly widespread in a growing number of countries and it has the potential to invade new areas and habitats, either associated to changes in vectors habitats, human circulation or climate changes.
From the dynamical point of view, the spatial-temporal interaction of models that try to adjust to such events are rich and challenging.
The first challenges are to address the dynamics of the vectors (very fast and local) and the dynamics of humans (very heterogeneous and non-local).
The objective of the present paper is to use the well-known Ross-Macdonald models, incorporating spatial movements, identifying different times scales and estimate in a suitable way the parameters.

Loss of pyrethroid resistance in newly established laboratory colonies of Aedes aegypti  BackgroundResistance to pyrethroid insecticides in Aedes aegypti has become widespread after almost two decades of their frequent use to reduce arbovirus transmission.
Despite this, use of pyrethroids continues because they are relatively inexpensive and because of their low human toxicity.
A key component of resistance management assumes that there is a negative fitness associated with resistance alleles so that when insecticides are removed, resistance alleles will decline in frequency.
aegypti have demonstrated a decrease in pyrethroid resistance once the insecticide is removed.\n\nMethods/Principal FindingsThe present study aims to evaluate variation in the loss of pyrethroid resistance among newly established laboratory populations of Ae.
aegypti from Mexico.
Eight field collections were maintained for up to eight generations and we recorded changes in the frequencies of mutations at the V1,016I locus and at the F1,534C locus in the voltage gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene.
I1,016 and C1,534 confer resistance.
We also examined resistance ratios (RR) with type 1 and 2 pyrethroids.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceWe demonstrate that, in general, the frequency of the Ae.
aegypti pyrethroid resistance alleles I1,016 and C1,534 decline when they are freed from pyrethroid pressure in the laboratory.
In agreement with earlier studies, RR was positively correlated with I1,016 resistant allele frequencies and showed significant protection against permethrin, and deltamethrin whereas F1534C showed protection against permethrin but not against deltamethrin.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe author is interested in the evolution of genes that confer resistance to insecticides, especially when this evolution affects binding of insecticides to their target site.
The Voltage Gated Sodium Channel gene represents an excellent opportunity to understand how mutations at the target site(s) affect the evolution of resistance in many different pest insect species including Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of Dengue Virus, Yellow Fever, Zika and Chikungunya arboviruses.
Modelling the epidemiology of residual Plasmodium vivax malaria in a heterogeneous host population: a case study in the Amazon Basin  The overall malaria burden in the Americas has decreased dramatically over the past two decades, but residual transmission pockets persist across the Amazon Basin, where Plasmodium vivax is the predominant infecting species.
Current elimination efforts require a better quantitative understanding of malaria transmission dynamics for planning, monitoring, and evaluating interventions at the community level.
This can be achieved with mathematical models that properly account for risk heterogeneity in communities approaching elimination, where few individuals disproportionately contribute to overall malaria prevalence, morbidity, and onwards transmission.
Here we analyse demographic information combined with routinely collected malaria morbidity data from the town of Mancio Lima, the main urban transmission hotspot of Brazil.
We estimate the proportion of high-risk subjects in the host population by fitting compartmental susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) transmission models simultaneously to age-stratified vivax malaria incidence densities and the frequency distribution of P. vivax malaria attacks experienced by each individual over 12 months.
Simulations with the best-fitting SIS model indicate that 20% of the hosts contribute 86% of the overall vivax malaria burden.
Despite the low overall force of infection typically found in the Amazon, about one order of magnitude lower than that in rural Africa, high-risk individuals gradually develop clinical immunity following repeated infections and eventually constitute a substantial infectious reservoir comprised of asymptomatic parasite carriers that is overlooked by routine surveillance but likely fuels onwards malaria transmission.
High-risk individuals therefore represent a priority target for more intensive and effective interventions that may not be readily delivered to the entire community.
Co-circulation of Dengue Virus Serotypes 1 and 3 during the 2019 epidemic in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania  BackgroundDengue is an important mosquito-borne viral disease in tropical and sub-tropical countries.
In this study molecular characterization was carried out to determine dengue viruses circulating among patients at health facilities during 2019 epidemic in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.\n\nMethodsThe study involved outpatients seeking care for febrile illness at four health facilities in Kinondoni and Ilala Districts of Dar es Salaam City in Tanzania.
A total of 45 sera from the outpatients were confirmed dengue-positive for dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antigen and/or NS1-IgG/IgM antibodies using on-site rapid test.
The presence of the virus was detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method.
Of the 45 sera, 20 samples were selected randomly for identification of specific dengue virus serotypes using RT-PCR followed by evaluation of resulting amplicons on agarose gel electrophoresis.\n\nFindings and significanceBoth Dengue virus serotypes 1 (DENV-1) and 3 (DENV-3) were detected in the samples tested with the former being dominant.
We present the first evidence of dengue virus co-infection of DENV-1 and DENV-3 serotypes in Tanzania.
The emergence of DENV-1 indicates the possibility of importation of the virus to Tanzania from endemic countries.
Due to DENV serotype co-circulation, there is an increased risk of severe dengue in future epidemics.
Our findings advocate the importance of genomic-based surveillance to provide rapid evidence of dengue virus emergence/re-emergence and spread.\n\nAuthor SummaryDengue viruses are the most important mosquito-borne pathogens that pose a serious global health threat.
Tanzania has reported several dengue virus epidemics since 2010 with the majority of the epidemics occurring in Dar-es-Salaam city.
Until August 2019, a total of 6,859 dengue cases have been confirmed in the country.
We performed molecular characterization of dengue viruses (DENV) circulating during the 2019 epidemic phase.
It was found that DENV-1 serotype was dominant during the epidemic and two samples of the tested sera were co-infected by DENV-1 and DENV-3 serotypes.
These findings emphasize the importance of genomic-based surveillance of dengue viruses in Tanzania to guide strategies for appropriate interventions.
Effective strategies for preventing reestablishment of malaria in areas with recent elimination and high transmission potential  Maintaining zero transmission after malaria elimination will be a challenging task for many countries where malaria is still endemic.
When local transmission potential is high, and importation of malaria infections continues from neighboring areas with ongoing transmission, malaria programs must develop robust surveillance and outbreak response systems.
Using an agent-based, spatial microsimulation model of two areas in southern Zambia, where elimination efforts are currently underway, we compare the ability of various routine and reactive intervention packages to maintain near-zero prevalence in the face of continued importation.
We find that in formerly moderate-transmission areas, high treatment rate of symptomatic malaria is sufficient to prevent reestablishment of malaria.
Routine redistributions of insecticide-treated nets and reactive case detection with antimalarial drugs cannot completely compensate for inadequate case management.
In formerly high-transmission areas, excellent case management and maintenance of good bednet coverage are both required to prevent resurgence, and outbreak response with antimalarial drugs or additional vector control is also necessary.
These results begin to describe the essential criteria for operations that successfully prevent reestablishment of malaria post-elimination and highlight the need for both long-term, sustainable excellence in primary care and comprehensive surveillance that feeds into rapid and flexible outbreak response.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe global community is working toward malaria elimination, but some areas will eliminate before others.
Eliminated areas will need to develop intervention programs capable of preventing imported infections from leading to reestablishment, a particular challenge when transmission was previously very high.
Using a simulation model built to capture malaria transmission and intervention history of two areas that recently made enormous progress toward elimination, we tested how well different intervention programs were able to prevent reestablishment of malaria.
We found that treating as many symptomatic cases as possible was the single most important intervention to implement.
Other areas with historically higher transmission required maintaining vector control to contain mosquito populations.
Localized outbreak response with antimalarial drugs or additional vector control was also necessary and predicted to be a highly efficient use of resources.
Modeling Mayaro and Chikungunya Control Strategies in Rio de Janeiro Outbreaks  Mosquito-borne diseases have become a significant health issue in many regions around the world.
For tropical countries, diseases such as Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya, became epidemic in the last decades.
Health surveillance reports during this period were crucial in providing scientific-based information to guide decision making and resources allocation to control outbreaks.
In this work, we perform data analysis of last Chikungunya epidemics in the city of Rio de Janeiro by applying a compartmental mathematical model.
High Plasmodium infection intensity in naturally infected malaria vectors in Africa  The population dynamics of human-to-mosquito malaria transmission in the field has important implications for the genetics, epidemiology and control of malaria.
The number of oocysts in oocysts positive mosquitoes developing from a single, naturally acquired infectious blood meal (herein referred to as parasite exposure) greatly influence the effectiveness of transmission blocking interventions but still remains poorly documented.
During a year-long analysis of malaria parasite transmission in Burkina Faso we caught and dissected wild malaria vectors to assess Plasmodium oocysts prevalence and load (the number of oocysts counted in mosquitoes with detectable oocysts) and the prevalence of salivary gland sporozoites.
This was compared to malaria endemicity in the human population assessed in cross-sectional surveys.
Data was analyzed using a novel transmission mathematical model to estimate the per-bite transmission probability and the average parasite exposure of mosquitoes for each location.
Observed oocysts load and estimated parasite exposure in naturally infected mosquitoes is substantially higher than previous estimates (ranging from 3.2 to 24.5 according to seasons and locations) and indicates a strong positive association between parasite exposure of mosquitoes and parasite prevalence in human.
This work suggests that highly infected mosquitoes may have a greater influence on the epidemiology and genetics of the parasite and that novel partially effective transmission blocking interventions may become more effective at halting transmission as parasite exposure is diminished.
Not all MDAs should be created equal-determinants of MDA impact and designing MDAs towards malaria elimination  Malaria remains at the forefront of scientific research and global political and funding agendas.
Previous malaria models of mass-interventions have consistently oversimplified how mass interventions are implemented.
We present an individual based, spatially explicit model of malaria transmission that includes all the programmatic implementation details of mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns.
We uncover how the impact of MDA campaigns is determined by the interaction between implementation logistics, patterns of human mobility and how transmission risk is distributed over space.
This translates into a higher likelihood of malaria elimination for areas with true prevalence under 3% with a faster implementation, in highly mobile populations.
We conclude that mass drug interventions can be an invaluable tool towards malaria elimination in the right context, specifically when paired with effective vector control.
Overlapping and distinct roles of CDPK family members in the pre-erythrocytic cycle of the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium berghei  Invasion of, development within, and exit from hepatocytes by Plasmodium is essential for the parasite to establish the malaria-causing erythrocytic cycle.
Identification of signaling pathways that operate during the pre-erythrocytic cycle provides insights into a critical stage of infection and potential targets for chemoprevention of disease.
Calcium Dependent Protein Kinases (CDPK) represent a kinase family that is present in Plasmodium but absent in mammals.
We demonstrate that P. berghei homologs of CDPK1, CDPK4 and CDPK5 play overlapping but distinct roles in sporozoite invasion and parasite egress from hepatocytes.
Increased cGMP compensates for the functional loss of CDPK1 and CDPK5 during sporozoite invasion but cannot overcome CDPK4s loss.
CDPK1 and CDPK5 expression is downregulated after sporozoite invasion.
CDPK5 reappears in a subset of late stage liver stages and is present in all merosomes.
Chemical inhibition of CDPK4 and depletion of CDPK5 in liver stages suggests that these kinases play a role in the formation and/or release of merosomes from mature liver stages.
Furthermore, depletion of CDPK5 in merosomes significantly delays a merosome-initiated erythrocytic cycle without affecting the infectivity of hepatic merozoites.
These data suggest that CDPK5 is required for the release of hepatic merozoites from merosomes.
Our work provides the first evidence that sporozoite invasion requires CDPK1 and CDPK5 and that the release of hepatic merozoites is a regulated process.\n\nSignificanceThe malaria-parasite Plasmodium begins its mammalian cycle by infecting hepatocytes in the liver.
A single parasite differentiates into tens of thousands of hepatic merozoites which exit the host cell in vesicles called merosomes.
Hepatic merozoites initiate the first round of erythrocytic infection that leads to disease symptoms.
We show that optimal invasion of liver cells by Plasmodium requires the action of three closely-related parasite kinases, CDPK1, 4 and 5.
Loss of any of the three enzymes in the parasite significantly reduces infection of liver cells.
CDPK5 is also required for the release of hepatic merozoites from merosomes and therefore for initiating the erythrocytic cycle.
A better understanding of how these kinases function could lead to drugs that prevent malaria.
P. falciparum gametocyte density and infectivity in peripheral blood and skin tissue of naturally infected parasite carriers  Transmission of Plasmodium falciparum depends on the presence of mature gametocytes that can be ingested by mosquitoes taking a bloodmeal when feeding on human skin.
It has long been hypothesised that skin sequestration contributes to efficient transmission.
Although skin sequestration would have major implications for our understanding of transmission biology and the suitability of mosquito feeding methodologies to measure the human infectious reservoir, it has never been formally tested.
In two populations of naturally infected gametocyte carriers from Burkina Faso, we assessed transmission potential to mosquitoes and directly quantified male and female gametocytes and asexual parasites in: i) finger prick blood, ii) venous blood, iii) skin biopsies, and in pools of mosquitoes that fed iv) on venous blood or, v) directly on the skin.
Whilst more mosquitoes became infected when feeding directly on the skin compared to venous blood, concentrations of gametocytes in the subdermal skin vasculature were identical to that in other blood compartments.
Asexual parasite densities, gametocyte densities and sex ratios were identical in the mosquito blood meals taken directly from the skin of parasite carriers and their venous blood.\n\nWe also observed sparse gametocytes in skin biopsies from legs and arms of gametocyte carriers by microscopy.
Taken together, we provide conclusive evidence for the absence of significant skin sequestration of P. falciparum gametocytes.
Gametocyte densities in peripheral blood are thus informative for predicting onward transmission potential to mosquitoes.
Quantifying this human malaria transmission potential is of pivotal importance for the deployment and monitoring of malaria elimination initiatives.\n\nIMPORTANCEOur observations settle a long-standing question in the malaria field and close a major knowledge gap in the parasite cycle.
By deploying mosquito feeding experiments and stage-specific molecular and immunofluorescence parasite detection methodologies in two populations of naturally infected parasite carriers, we conclusively reject the hypothesis of gametocyte skin sequestration.
Our findings provide novel insights in parasite stage composition in human blood compartments, mosquito bloodmeals and their implications for transmission potential.
We demonstrate that gametocyte levels in venous or finger prick blood can be used to predict onward transmission potential to mosquitoes.
Our findings thus pave the way for methodologies to quantify the human infectious reservoir based on conventional blood sampling approaches to support the deployment and monitoring of malaria elimination efforts for maximum public health impact.
Zygote morphogenesis but not the establishment of cell polarity in Plasmodium berghei is controlled by the small GTPase, RAB11A  Plasmodium species are apicomplexan parasites whose zoites are polarized cells with a marked apical organisation where the organelles associated with host cell invasion and colonization reside.
Plasmodium gametes mate in the mosquito midgut to form the spherical and presumed apolar zygote that morphs during the following 24 hours into a polarized, elongated and motile zoite form, the ookinete.
Endocytosis-mediated protein transport is generally necessary for the establishment and maintenance of polarity in epithelial cells and neurons, and the small GTPase RAB11A is an important regulator of protein transport via recycling endosomes.
PbRAB11A is essential in blood stage asexual of Plasmodium.
Therefore, a promoter swap strategy was employed to down-regulate PbRAB11A expression in gametocytes and zygotes of the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium berghei which demonstrated the essential role of RAB11A in ookinete development.
The approach revealed that lack of PbRAB11A had no effect on gamete production and fertility rates however, the zygote to ookinete transition was almost totally inhibited and transmission through the mosquito was prevented.
Lack of PbRAB11A did not prevent meiosis and mitosis, nor the establishment of polarity as indicated by the correct formation and positioning of the Inner Membrane Complex (IMC) and apical complex.
However, morphological maturation was prevented and parasites remained spherical and immotile and furthermore, they were impaired in the secretion and distribution of microneme cargo.
The data are consistent with the previously proposed model of RAB11A endosome mediated delivery of plasma membrane in Toxoplasma gondii if not its role in IMC formation and implicate it in microneme function.
Author SummaryAccording to the WHO there was estimated to be over 200 million cases of malaria in 2017 and nearly half a million deaths.
The disease is caused by specific species of Plasmodium which are passed between human hosts by a mosquito vector.
In order to transmit through the mosquito the single-celled parasite undergoes many developmental changes as it morphs from non-motile blood forms to become a polarised and motile ookinete in the mosquito midgut.
Transport of proteins within the cell during these critical morphological transitions relies on specific endosome vesicles to correctly target proteins within the parasite.
We investigated the role of the RAB11A protein which is known to be involved in endosomal vesicle targeting to generate cellular polarity in other organisms.
Because RAB11A is also essential for parasite growth in the mammalian host we used a promoter swap system to specifically switch off RAB11A in the sexual transmission stages.
In the absence of RAB11A parasites were unable to form elongated, motile ookinetes and were unable to pass through the mosquito.
Interestingly the parasites were able to form some of the (polarising) structures specific to ookinetes however full morphological transformation did not occur and the parasites were not motile.
We show that although proteins are still delivered to the parasite surface, secretion is impaired and that the mutant parasites are smaller despite obvious microtubule formation implying that there is a deficit in delivery of membrane to the surface.
Opening Pandora’s Box: Distribution of Plasmodium gametocytes in bloodstream  Malaria, a vector borne disease caused by Plasmodium spp., remains a major global cause of morbidity and mortality.
Optimization of the disease control strategies requires a thorough understanding of the fundamental processes underlying parasite transmission.
Although the number of transmissible stages of Plasmodium (gametocyte) in human blood is frequently used as an indicator of human-to-mosquito transmission potential, this relationship is not always clear.
Important efforts have been made to develop molecular tools to fine-tune gametocyte densities estimation and therefore improve the prediction of mosquito infection rates, but a significant level of uncertainty around this estimate remains.
Here we show with both human and avian malaria system that the within-vertebrate host distribution of gametocytes could explain much of this uncertainty.
By comparing gametocyte densities in bloodstream between different body parts, we found a difference by nearly 50% in humans and by more than 15% in birds.
An estimation of gametocyte density from only one blood sample, as is usually the case, could therefore drastically over- or underestimated the infectivity of gametocyte carriers.
This might have important consequences on the epidemiology of the disease since we show, using the avian malaria system, that this variation influences the transmission of the parasite to the mosquito vector.
In the light of our results, we argue that it is essential to consider the heterogeneous distribution of gametocyte to improve human diagnosis, identify infectious reservoirs and to test new malaria control strategies.
A biosynthetic platform for antimalarial drug discovery  Advances in synthetic biology have enabled production of a variety of compounds using bacteria as a vehicle for complex compound biosynthesis.
Violacein, a naturally occurring indole pigment with antibiotic properties, can be biosynthetically engineered in Escherichia coli expressing its non-native synthesis pathway.
To explore whether this synthetic biosynthesis platform could be used for drug discovery, here we have screened bacterially-derived violacein against the main causative agent of human malaria, Plasmodium falciparum.
We show the antiparasitic activity of bacterially-derived violacein against the P. falciparum 3D7 laboratory reference strain as well as drug-sensitive and resistant patient isolates, confirming the potential utility of this drug as an antimalarial.
We then screen a biosynthetic series of violacein derivatives against P. falciparum growth.
The demonstrated varied activity of each derivative against asexual parasite growth points to potential for further development of violacein as an antimalarial.
Towards defining its mode of action, we show that biosynthetic violacein affects the parasite actin cytoskeleton, resulting in an accumulation of actin signal that is independent of actin polymerization.
More broadly, our data show that bacterial synthetic biosynthesis is a suitable platform for antimalarial drug discovery with potential applications in high-throughput and cost-effective drug screening with otherwise chemically-intractable natural products.
Temporal models using environmental variables to predict Aedes aegypti oviposition activity in a temperate region of Argentina.
Environmental variables are some of the factors that more impact on Aedes aegypti, vector of Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika viruses.
aegypti oviposition activity was related to satellite and meteorological variables, in Cordoba City (Argentina).
Eggs were collected using ovitraps placed throughout the city from 2009 to 2012, replaced them weekly.
Generalized Linear Mixed Models were developed with negative binomial distributions of errors, modeling average number of eggs collected weekly as a function of satellite and meteorological variables with time lags.
The best model included a vegetation index, vapor pressure of water, precipitation and photoperiod, lagged between 3 and 4 weeks.
By each increment unit in vegetation index, vapor pressure (hPa) and light hour, the average number of eggs increases by 72%, 20% and 29%, respectively, in the following 3 or 4 weeks.
In addition, the average number of eggs decreases a 50% in the following month by each millimeter of rain.
The results evince the relevant importance of the vegetation, maybe due to the shade that provide to the containers as breeding habitat of this species and the shelter for adults.
On the other hand, the negative effect of precipitation could be a consequence of abundant rainfalls that fulfill containers avoiding females to lay eggs in there.
Although no significant effect of the photoperiod on the vector abundance has been detected in the north of the country, in Cordoba City an important effect is observed when it is presented together with other variables, producing different effects of these variables in different regions.

An integrated platform for genome engineering and gene expression perturbation in Plasmodium falciparum  Establishing robust genome engineering methods in the malarial parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, has the potential to substantially improve the efficiency with which we gain understanding of this pathogens biology to propel treatment and elimination efforts.
Methods for manipulating gene expression and engineering the P. falciparum genome have been validated.
However, a significant barrier to fully leveraging these advances is the difficulty associated with assembling the extremely high AT content DNA constructs required for modifying the P. falciparum genome.
These are frequently unstable in commonly-used circular plasmids.
We address this bottleneck by devising a DNA assembly framework leveraging the improved reliability with which large AT-rich regions can be efficiently manipulated in linear plasmids.
This framework integrates several key functional genetics outcomes via CRISPR/Cas9 and other methods from a common, validated framework.
Overall, this molecular toolkit enables P. falciparum genetics broadly and facilitates deeper interrogation of parasite genes involved in diverse biological processes.
Eco-evolutionary dynamics of Plasmodium genotypes under mass drug administration  Mass Drug Administration (MDA) is regarded as a potential strategy for locally interrupting transmission of human malaria under specific circumstances.
However, insights on how MDA affects the eco-evolutionary dynamics of different Plasmodium species are not well known.
We provide a computational model where the ecologically explicit life cycle of the parasite is implemented.
Since the parasite inhabits two different ecological niches - human host and the mosquito - it undergoes different selection pressures during its reproduction.
We use the model to perform an evolutionary analysis of the dynamics of resistance alleles under atovaquone, chloroquine and combined atovaquone-chloroquine drug treatments.
Our study shows how the reduced viability of resistant parasites in the mosquito affects the spread of resistance and transmission interruption in treated human populations.
Overall, results confirm that the disadvantage of drug-resistant genotypes in the mosquito vector is a good tool to achieve malaria control goals under MDA programmes.\n\nAuthor summaryEvery year there are millions of new malaria cases reported worldwide.
The cause of the disease is the infection by Plasmodium, a protozoan which is transmitted between humans through the bite of a mosquito.
Antimalarials have existed since long, but Plasmodium has evolved resistance to the treatment, making it necessary to develop new strategies to heal the infected humans.
Lately, it has been pointed out that mosquitoes could be our allies when using drugs such as atovaquone, which resistant parasites have difficulties to reproduce in the mosquito.
Here we study the scenarios in which these drugs, used in Mass Drug Administration (MDA) programmes, can interrupt the transmission of malaria in local treated populations.
Coordination among neighbors improves the efficacy of Zika control despite economic costs  BackgroundEmerging mosquito-borne viruses like Zika, dengue, and chikungunya pose a major threat to public health, especially in low-income regions of Central and South America, southeast Asia, and the Caribbean.
Outbreaks of these diseases are likely to have long-term social and economic consequences due to Zika-induced congenital microcephaly and other complications.
Larval control of the container-inhabiting mosquitoes that transmit these infections is an important tool for mitigating outbreaks.
However, metapopulation theory suggests that spatiotemporally uneven larvicide treatment can impede control effectiveness, as recolonization compensates for mortality within patches.
Coordinating the timing of treatment among patches could therefore substantially improve epidemic control, but we must also consider economic constraints, since coordination may have costs that divert resources from treatment.\n\nMethodology/Principle FindingsTo inform practical disease management strategies, we ask how coordination among neighbors in the timing of mosquito control efforts influences the size of a mosquito-borne infectious disease outbreak under the realistic assumption that coordination has costs.
Using an SIR/metapopulation model of mosquito and disease dynamics, we examine whether larvicide treatment triggered by surveillance information from neighboring patches reduces human infections when incorporating coordination costs.
We examine how different types of coordination costs and different surveillance methods jointly influence the effectiveness of larval control.
With epidemiological surveillance, coordination improves disease outcomes, even when costly.
With demographic surveillance, coordination either improves or hampers disease control, depending on the type of costs and surveillance sensitivity.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceOur results suggest coordination among neighbors can improve management of mosquito-borne epidemics under many, but not all, assumptions about costs.
Therefore, estimating coordination costs is an important step for most effectively applying metapopulation theory to strategies for managing outbreaks of mosquito-borne viral infections.\n\nAuthor SummaryMosquito-borne viruses, such as Zika, are an urgent public health threat, particularly in tropical, low-income regions.
Vector control, the main strategy for combatting outbreaks, can be challenging because the urban-adapted, container-breeding mosquitoes that transmit these viruses often exhibit metapopulation dynamics, where mortality in one population is compensated by migration from neighboring populations.
Using a model of virus transmission and vector population dynamics, we demonstrate that local mosquito control initiatives aimed at reducing the burden of Zika and other mosquito-borne infections are most effective when there is communication of surveillance findings among neighboring control agencies and coordination over the timing of mosquito reduction treatments.
We find that local communication improves epidemic outcomes even when it imposes costs to resource-limited control agencies due to gains in the efficiency of mosquito control from spatial coordination.
Critical analysis of the mosquito repellency evoked by the 10-34 kHz recorded animal sounds: The case of the African female A. gambiae s.s  Animals sounds have been mimicked in electronic mosquito repellents (EMRs) and exploited as a tool in the control of malaria by targeting the vector, the female Anopheles gambiae s.s.
The claimed mosquito repellency of 30.3 % due to Anti-Pic(R), an electronic mosquito repellent, had failed to be confirmed in subsequent studies.
However, studies on mosquito startle based on initial behavioural activities without an attractant yielded 34.12 % repellency elicited by the 10-34 kHz recorded sound of O. tormota.
Other malaria intervention measures involving the use of chemicals have been impeded by the pathogen and vector resistance hence slowing down the rate of decline of malaria morbidity and mortality.
The research thus focused on the analytical study of the African female A. gambiae s.s repellency evoked by the 10-34 kHz recorded animal sound of male mosquito, Anopheles gambiae and Delphinapterus leucas.
Landing rates and behavioural startle responses of the mated female A. gambiae on food attractant evoked by the individual sound of the male mosquito, A. gambiae, O. tormota and D. leucas were determined and analysed.

Landing rates and behavioural startle responses of the mated female A. gambiae on food attractant evoked by the individual sound of the male mosquito, A. gambiae, O. tormota and D. leucas were determined and analysed.
The male and female A. gambiae were bred and reared under controlled laboratory conditions of 60-80 % humidity, 25{+/-}2 {degrees}C temperature with equal light-darkness hour cycle in KEMRI, entomology laboratories.
Isolation of the male and female mosquitoes from a swarm was based on physical features and affinity to blood meal.
The sounds of O. tormota and D. leucas were acquired and the sound of the male A. gambiae were recorded from the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) entomology laboratory, Kisumu.
The sounds were filtered into 10-34 kHz frequency band and analysed using Avisoft-SAS LAB Pro version 5.2 and Raven Pro 1.5 software.
The sound of O. tormota was also studied.
A fighto-Y glass cage well designed into control, neutral and treatment chambers was used in the study.
Both control and treatment chambers were connected to blood meal maintained at 38.60{degrees}C. The treatment cage was also connected to the source of sound and a swarm of 50 female mosquitoes into the neutral cage and observed for 1,200 s. The sounds of the A. gambiae, O. tormota and D. leucas yielded 2.10, 2.20 and 3.00 landings/minute respectively associated with adverse behaviour.

Protein prenylation and Hsp40 in thermotolerance of Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites  During its complex life cycle, the malaria parasite survives dramatic changes in environmental temperature.
Protein prenylation is required during asexual replication of Plasmodium falciparum, and heat shock protein 40 (HSP40; PF3D7_1437900) is post-translationally modified with a 15-carbon farnesyl isoprenyl group.
In other organisms, farnesylation of Hsp40 orthologs controls its localization and function, including temperature stress survival.
In this work, we find that plastidial isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) synthesis and protein farnesylation are required for malaria parasite survival after cold and heat shock.
Furthermore, loss of HSP40 farnesylation alters its membrane attachment and interaction with proteins involved in crucial biological processes, such as glycolysis and cytoskeletal organization.
Together, this work reveals that farnesylation of HSP40 in P. falciparum is a novel essential function of plastidial isoprenoid biosynthesis.
We propose a model by which farnesyl-HSP40 promotes parasite thermotolerance and facilitates vesicular trafficking through its interaction with client proteins.
Wolbachia strain wAu efficiently blocks arbovirus transmission in Aedes albopictus  The global incidence of arboviral diseases transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, including dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, has increased dramatically in recent decades.
The release of Aedes aegypti carrying the maternally inherited symbiont Wolbachia as an intervention to control arboviruses is being trialled in several countries.
However, these efforts are compromised in many endemic regions due to the co-localization of the secondary vector Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito.
To date, only the wMel and wPip strains of Wolbachia have been reported to be transferred into and characterized in this vector.
A Wolbachia strain naturally infecting Drosophila simulans, wAu, was selected for transfer into a Malaysian Ae.
albopictus line to create a novel triple-strain infection.
The newly generated line showed self-compatibility, moderate fitness cost and complete resistance to Zika and dengue infections.
Author summaryAedes albopictus, the invasive Asian tiger mosquito, is responsible for numerous outbreaks of important viruses such as dengue and Zika in various regions of the world.
The need for alterative control interventions propelled the development of a novel approach that exploits a natural insect symbiont, Wolbachia; when transferred into non-native hosts, these maternally-inherited bacteria are able to interfere with the transmission of mosquito-borne viruses, and also provide reproductive advantages to the host, offering a promising tool for self-sustaining field applications.
Currently, several field trials are ongoing for the primary vector of dengue and several other arboviruses, Aedes aegypti, providing encouraging results.
albopictus has been targeted for a similar approach: this mosquito species naturally carries two strains of Wolbachia.
The artificial introduction of a third, non-native strain made this line less able to transmit dengue and Zika viruses and had an impact on its fitness.
Artificial selection finds new hypotheses for the mechanism of Wolbachia-mediated dengue blocking in mosquitoes  Wolbachia is an intracellular bacterium that blocks virus replication in insects and has been introduced into the mosquito, Aedes aegypti for the biocontrol of arboviruses including dengue, Zika and chikungunya.
Despite ongoing research, the mechanism of Wolbachia-mediated virus blocking remains unclear.
We recently used experimental evolution to reveal that Wolbachia-mediated dengue blocking could be selected upon in the A. aegypti host and showed evidence that strong levels of blocking could be maintained by natural selection.
In this study, we investigate the genetic variation associated with blocking and use these analyses to generate testable hypotheses surrounding the mechanism of Wolbachia-mediated dengue blocking.
From our results, we hypothesise that Wolbachia may block virus replication by increasing the regeneration rate of mosquito cells via the Notch signalling pathway.
We also propose that Wolbachia modulates the hosts transcriptional pausing pathway either to prime the hosts anti-viral response or to directly inhibit viral replication.
Reticulocyte Infection Leads to Altered Behaviour, Drug Sensitivity and Host Cell Remodelling by Plasmodium falciparum.
Plasmodia are host-specific, both at the organism and cellular levels.
During asexual development, Plasmodium spp.
This applies to even Plasmodium (P.) falciparum, the most common causative agent of human malaria, implications of which remain unexplored.
Herein, for the first time, we characterize the developmental stages and features of P. falciparum cultured in vitro in young reticulocytes (CD71+) in comparison to standard normocyte (CD71-) cultures.
We demonstrate that there are notable differences in the patterns of invasion, development and sensitivity to potent antimalarials (such as artemisinin and dihydroartemisinin) for parasites residing in CD71+ reticulocytes.
Through a transcriptomic approach, we report that P. falciparum parasites are able to sense the host cell environment, and calibrate their metabolic and host cell remodelling pathways through differential gene expression.
These results form an exciting avenue on which hitherto unexplored interactions between Plasmodium spp and different stages of host red blood cells could be investigated in the broader contexts of drug resistance, host tropism and zoonosis.
Author SummaryParasites causing malaria infect red blood cells for development and proliferation during asexual development.
This asexual erythrocytic stage determines higher parasite densities and eventual disease manifestation.
Although the most virulent species of Plasmodium infecting humans known as Plasmodium falciparum is able to infect red blood cells of all ages, these parasites show a preference for younger blood cells.
Of note, the biochemical and biophysical properties of young and adult red blood cells vary significantly.
Herein, we undertook a comparative profiling of invasion process, parasite development and drug response of Plasmoddium falciparum in two host cells: young red blood cells (reticulocytes) and mature red blood cells (normocytes).
We demonstrate that P. falciparum infects human reticulocytes with higher affinity and demonstrate differential sensitivity to drugs such as artemisinin while they reside within reticulocytes.
Furthermore, we show that P. falciparum is able to detect differences in host environment and adapt to it by changing the expression of genes required for host cell remodelling.
Biophysical analysis of Plasmodium falciparum Hsp70-Hsp90 organizing protein (PfHop) reveals a monomer that is characterised by folded segments connected by flexible linkers  Plasmodium falciparum causes the most lethal form of malaria.
The cooperation of heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 and 90 is important for folding of a select number of cellular proteins that are crucial for cyto-protection and development of the parasites.
Hsp70 and Hsp90 are brought into a functional complex that allows substrate exchange by stress inducible protein 1 (STI1), also known as Hsp70-Hsp90 organizing protein (Hop).
P. falciparum Hop (PfHop) co-localises and occurs in complex with the parasite cytosolic chaperones, PfHsp70-1 and PfHsp90.
Here, we characterised the structure of recombinant PfHop using synchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SRCD) and small-angle X-ray scattering.
Structurally, PfHop is a monomeric, elongated but folded protein, in agreement with its predicted TPR domain structure.
Using SRCD, we established that PfHop is unstable at temperatures higher than 40 {degrees}C. This suggests that PfHop is less stable at elevated temperatures compared to its functional partner, PfHsp70-1, that is reportedly stable at temperatures as high as 80 {degrees}C. These findings contribute towards our understanding of the role of the Hop-mediated functional partnership between Hsp70 and Hsp90.

Structural role of essential light chains in the apicomplexan glideosome  AbstractApicomplexan parasites, such as Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii, traverse the host tissues and invade the host cells exhibiting a specific type of motility called gliding.
The molecular mechanism of gliding lies in the actin-myosin motor localized to the intermembrane space between the plasma membrane and inner membrane complex (IMC) of the parasites.
Myosin A (MyoA) is a part of the glideosome, a large multi-protein complex, which is anchored in the outer membrane of the IMC.
MyoA is bound to the proximal essential light chain (ELC) and distal myosin light chain (MLC1), which further interact with the glideosome associated proteins GAP40, GAP45 and GAP50.
Whereas structures of several individual glideosome components and small dimeric complexes have been solved, structural information concerning the interaction of larger glideosome subunits and their role in glideosome function still remains to be elucidated.
Here, we present structures of a T. gondii trimeric glideosome sub complex composed of a myosin A light chain domain with bound MLC1 and TgELC1 or TgELC2.
Regardless of the differences between the secondary structure content observed for free P. falciparum PfELC and T. gondii TgELC1 or TgELC2, the proteins interact with a conserved region of TgMyoA to form structurally conserved complexes.

Regardless of the differences between the secondary structure content observed for free P. falciparum PfELC and T. gondii TgELC1 or TgELC2, the proteins interact with a conserved region of TgMyoA to form structurally conserved complexes.
Upon interaction, the essential light chains undergo contraction and induce -helical structure in the myosin A C-terminus, stiffening the myosin lever arm.
The complex formation is further stabilized through binding of a single calcium ion to T. gondii ELCs.
Our work provides an important step towards the structural understanding of the entire glideosome and uncovering the role of its members in parasite motility and invasion.
Author summaryApicomplexans, such as Toxoplasma gondii or the malaria agent Plasmodium falciparum, are small unicellular parasites that cause serious diseases in humans and other animals.
These parasites move and infect the host cells by a unique type of motility called gliding.
Gliding is empowered by an actin-myosin molecular motor located at the periphery of the parasites.
Myosin interacts with additional proteins such as essential light chains to form the glideosome, a large protein assembly that anchors myosin in the inner membrane complex.
Here we describe the first structures of trimeric glideosome sub complexes of T. gondii myosin A bound to two different light chain combinations, which show that T. gondii and P. falciparum form structurally conserved complexes.

With additional data, we propose that the role of the essential light chains is to enhance myosin performance by inducing secondary structure in the C-terminus of myosin A.
Measles skin rash: infection of lymphoid and myeloid cells in the dermis precedes viral dissemination to keratinocytes in the epidermis  Measles is characterised by fever and a maculopapular skin rash, which is associated with immune clearance of measles virus (MV)-infected cells.
Histopathological analyses of skin biopsies from humans and non-human primates (NHPs) with measles rash have identified MV-infected keratinocytes and mononuclear cells in the epidermis, around hair follicles and near sebaceous glands.
Here, we address the pathogenesis of measles skin rash by combining data from experimentally infected NHPs, ex vivo infection of human skin sheets and in vitro infection of primary human keratinocytes.
Longitudinal analysis of the skin of experimentally MV-infected NHPs demonstrated that infection in the skin precedes onset of rash by several days.
MV infection was initiated in lymphoid and myeloid cells in the dermis before dissemination to the epidermal keratinocytes.
These data were in good concordance with ex vivo MV infections of human skin sheets, in which dermal cells were more targeted than the epidermal ones.
To address viral dissemination to the epidermis and to determine whether the dissemination is receptor-dependent, we performed experimental infections of primary keratinocytes collected from healthy or nectin-4-deficient donors.
These experiments demonstrated that MV infection of keratinocytes is nectin-4-dependent, and nectin-4 expression was higher in differentiated than in proliferating keratinocytes.
Based on these data, we hypothesise that measles skin rash is initiated by migrating MV-infected lymphocytes that infect dermal skin-resident CD150+ immune cells.
The infection is subsequently disseminated from the dermal papillae to nectin-4+ keratinocytes in the basal epidermis.
Lateral spread of MV infection is observed in the superficial epidermis, most likely due to the higher level of nectin-4 expression on differentiated keratinocytes.
Finally, MV-infected cells are cleared by infiltrating immune cells, causing hyperaemia and oedema, which give the appearance of morbilliform skin rash.
Author SummarySeveral viral infections are associated with skin rash, including parvovirus B19, human herpesvirus type 6, dengue virus and rubella virus.
However, the archetype virus infection that leads to skin rash is measles.
Although all of these viral exanthemata often appear similar, their pathogenesis is different.
In the case of measles, the appearance of skin rash is a sign that the immune system is clearing MV-infected cells from the skin.
How the virus reaches the skin and is locally disseminated remains unknown.
Here we combine observations and expertise from pathologists, dermatologists, virologists and immunologists to delineate the pathogenesis of measles skin rash.
We show that MV infection of dermal myeloid and lymphoid cells precedes viral dissemination to the epidermal keratinocytes.
We speculate that immune-mediated clearance of these infected cells results in hyperaemia and oedema, explaining the redness of the skin and the slightly elevated spots of the morbilliform rash.
Genomic and transcriptomic evidence for descent from Plasmodium and loss of blood schizogony in Hepatocystis parasites from naturally infected red colobus monkeys  Hepatocystis is a genus of single-celled parasites infecting monkeys, bats and squirrels.
Although thought to descend from malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.
), Hepatocystis spp.
are thought not to undergo replication in the blood - the part of the Plasmodium life cycle which causes the symptoms of malaria.
Furthermore, Hepatocystis is transmitted by midges, not mosquitoes.
Comparative genomics of Hepatocystis and Plasmodium species therefore presents an opportunity to better understand some of the most important aspects of malaria parasite biology.
We were able to generate a draft genome for Hepatocystis using DNA sequencing reads from the blood of a naturally infected red colobus monkey.
We provide robust phylogenetic support for Hepatocystis as a sister group to Plasmodium parasites infecting rodents.
We show transcriptomic support for a lack of replication in the blood and genomic support for a complete loss of a family of genes involved in red blood cell invasion.
Our analyses highlight the rapid evolution of genes involved in parasite vector stages, revealing genes that may be critical for interactions between malaria parasites and mosquitoes.
Prevalence, risk factors and health seeking behaviour of pulmonary tuberculosis in four tribal dominated districts of Odisha  AimTo determine the prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis, socio-cultural practices and health seeking behaviour of tribal people in four districts of Odisha.
MethodologyThis was an action research study with qualitative and quantitative design following a sequential approach implemented in a 4-phased manner.
The screening for active TB among chest symptomatics is followed as per the guidelines of the (RNTCP) Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program in India.
ResultsIn all, 1455 households were surveyed in the 6 tribal dominated villages of 4 districts, namely Balangir, Dhenkanal, Kandhmal and Mayurbhanj.
Based on the eligibility, 5144 (97.7%) individuals were screened.
About 139 (2.3%) could not be screened due to non-availability in their households during day time.
Out of these, 126 chest symptomatic individuals were identified.
Sputum samples were collected from these and sent to the National Reference Laboratory, RMRC, Bhubaneswar using public transport and maintaining cold chain.
35 patients were found to be having active TB disease.
18 were culture positive.
The prevalence of pulmonary TB is 0.68%.
The risk factors seemed to be ignorance about TB symptoms, addiction to alcoholic drinks, difficulty reaching the health facilities owing to the long distances, lack of communication and transport.
In addition, other morbidities like Malaria, diabetes, hypertension, malnutrition, etc.
ConclusionObserved prevalence suggests further strengthening of TB control program.
This study is the first of its kind in this State.
Malaria transmission assisted by interaction between Plasmodium α-tubulin-1 and Anopheles FREP1 protein  Passage of Plasmodium through a mosquito midgut is essential for malaria transmission.
FREP1, a peritrophic matrix protein in a mosquito midgut, binds to the parasite and mediates Plasmodium infection in Anopheles.
The FREP1-mediated Plasmodium invasion pathway is highly conserved across multiple species of Plasmodium and Anopheles.
Through pulldown, nine P. berghei proteins were co-precipitated with FREP1-conjugated beads.
After cloning these nine genes from P. berghei and expressing them in insect cells, six of them were confirmed to interact with recombinant FREP1 protein.
Among them, -tubulin-1 and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) were highly conserved in Plasmodium species with >95% identity.
Thus, P. falciparum -tubulin-1 and Hsp70 were cloned and expressed in E. coli to stimulate antibody (Ab) in mice.
Our results showed that anti-serum against P. falciparum -tubulin-1 significantly inhibited P. falciparum transmission to An.
Our results showed that anti-serum against P. falciparum -tubulin-1 significantly inhibited P. falciparum transmission to An.
Our results showed that anti-serum against P. falciparum -tubulin-1 significantly inhibited P. falciparum transmission to An.
gambiae, while Ab against P. falciparum Hsp70 serum did not.
The polyclonal Ab against human -tubulin did not interfere formation of ookinetes, however, significantly reduced the number of P. falciparum oocysts in An.
gambiae midguts.
Moreover, fluorescence microscope assays showed that anti--tubulin Ab bound to impermeable Plasmodium ookinete apical invasive apparatus.
Therefore, we propose that the interaction between Anopheles FREP1 protein and Plasmodium -tubulin-1 directs the ookinete invasive apparatus towards midgut peritrophic matrix for the efficient passage of the parasite.
Anopheles FREP1 and Plasmodium -tubulin-1 are potential targets for blocking malaria transmission to the mosquito host.
AUTHOR SUMMARYThe molecular mechanisms of malaria transmission to mosquito are not well-understood.
FREP1 proteins in mosquito midget PM has been proved to mediate malaria transmission by binding to parasite ookinetes.
Here we reported that Plasmodium parasite -tubulin-1 is an FREP1 binding partner.
We initially identified the -tubulin-1 through the FREP1-pulldown assay; Then we cloned P. falciparum -tubulin-1, and demonstrated that the insect cell expressed recombinant Plasmodium -tubulin-1 bound to FREP1 in vitro; Next, mouse anti-serum against P. falciparum -tubulin-1 was found to inhibit P. falciparum transmission to An.

P. falciparum -tubulin-1 shares >84% identical amino acid sequence with human -tubulin, purified Ab against human -tubulin significantly inhibited malaria transmission.
Anti-human -tubulin Ab did not interfere the gametocyte-to-ookinetes conversion.
Final, we found that anti--tubulin Ab bound to the apical end of impermeable ookinetes.
Structurally, ookinete invasive apparatus locates at the apical opening.
Therefore, we propose that the interaction between Anopheles midgut FREP1 protein and Plasmodium apical -tubulin-1 directs the ookinete invasive apparatus towards midgut PM for the efficient parasite invasion.
Zika and dengue viruses infecting wild-caught mosquitoes in an environmental protection area in Brazil  Species of the genus Flavivirus are widespread in Brazil and are a major public health concern.
The city of Sao Paulo is in a highly urbanized area with some green spaces which are used for recreation and where potential vertebrate hosts and mosquito vectors of these arboviruses can be found, a scenario that can contribute to the transmission of flaviviruses to humans.
This study therefore sought to investigate natural flavivirus infection in mosquitoes collected in the Capivari-Monos Environmental Protection Area (EPA) in the south of the city.
Monthly mosquito collections were carried out from March 2016 to April 2017 with CO2-baited CDC light traps.
Specimens were identified morphologically and grouped in pools.
A total of 260 pools of non-engorged females were inoculated into the C6/36 cell lineage after analysis by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA).
IFA-positive specimens were tested by qRT-PCR with genus-specific primers targeting a region of ~260 nucleotides in the flavivirus NS5 gene, and the PCR products were sequenced to confirm and identify the flavivirus species.
Anopheles (Kerteszia) cruzii and Wyeomyia (Prosopolepis) confusa were the most frequent species collected.
Zika virus (ZIKV) nucleotide sequences were detected in three mosquito species, An.
cruzii, Limatus durhami and Wy.
confusa, and dengue virus 2 (DENV-2) sequences in Culex.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of natural isolation of DENV-2 and ZIKV in sylvatic species of mosquitoes in the Capivari-Monos EPA.
Our findings suggest that DENV-2 is present in Culex mosquitoes, and ZIKV in Anopheles, Wyeomyia and Limatus.
The flavivirus species identified here are of medical importance; surveillance is therefore recommended in this EPA, where vertebrates and mosquitoes can act as flavivirus hosts and vectors.
